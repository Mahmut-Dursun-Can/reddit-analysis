"I know the struggle with Mathematics so I developed this APP I grew up in a remote area where basic education felt like a luxury. Our school had limited resources, and math was always the biggest challenge—not because we weren’t curious, but because we didn’t have the right tools or guidance. Books were outdated, and most of us struggled with concepts beyond basic arithmetic.  Years later, with a background in tech and a deep memory of that struggle, I had a crazy idea—what if we could build something smart enough to help students solve math problems, right from their phones? Something that doesn’t just give answers but shows steps, explains logic, and makes math feel less scary?  That thought became a side project, then an obsession. I created a simple Android app powered by AI to scan math problems and generate clear, step-by-step solutions. I called it Math Magic Solver.  But I didn’t want it to just sit on the Play Store—I wanted it to make a real difference. So, we bought a few budget tablets, loaded the app on them, and donated them to schools in under-resourced areas like the one I grew up in.  Watching students tap on a screen and actually understand a math concept they’d been struggling with—that was the moment I knew it was worth every late night.  Today, Math Magic Solver is live on the Google Play Store. It’s free, simple, and built with one purpose: to help anyone, anywhere, learn math a little easier.  Sometimes, the best tech isn’t born in big offices or fancy labs—it starts with a struggle, a memory, and a little spark of an idea.

"My First Custom ROM Experience: 2 Days of Hell (Thanks, Samsung) It was my first time flashing a custom ROM, and honestly, it was incredibly frustrating — mostly because of Samsung. First, I installed LineageOS, but VoLTE wasn’t working. I’m from India and use a Jio SIM, which completely relies on VoLTE for calls, SMS. Thanks to Samsung’s restrictions, I couldn’t log into my Google account, bank apps, WhatsApp, Instagram, or anything else.  I started searching for solutions, and after a lot of effort, I discovered that Samsung locks VoLTE functionality to their own firmware. So unless you're using One UI or a custom ROM based on it, VoLTE won’t work. That means AOSP-based ROMs like LineageOS, Graphene, Pixel Experience, etc., won’t support VoLTE.  So I tried installing UN1CA, a One UI-based custom ROM. It was One UI 6.1 with Android 14, but with some AI functionality restrictions. Then I wondered: can I get Android 15 and One UI 7? After some digging on XDA forums, I found that someone had just two weeks ago ported One UI 7 from the Galaxy A73 to my device.  Excited, I went ahead and tried to install it — but the process was completely different from what I had done with LineageOS. I tried anyway, but my phone got stuck at the boot screen, then showed a broken Android logo with ""No data"" written underneath. Nothing worked. I thought my phone was dead.  But thanks to a kind soul on YouTube, I fixed the issue and managed to boot into LineageOS again. The problem was with the vbmeta file. I was using the correct model, but the version I flashed was for the Canadian variant, while mine is for India. So the signature check failed.  I slept on it and woke up determined to give it another shot — now armed with all the knowledge I’d gathered in just one day. I flashed the correct vbmeta file, and boom... the bootloader (TWRP) loaded successfully. But the touch wasn’t working. Another YouTuber explained it was because of leftover files from LineageOS.  So I had to revert to the stock Samsung ROM. Surprisingly, Samsung made it super easy to go back — this was actually the easiest part of the whole process. Once back, I booted into TWRP again and initially thought of installing UN1CA One UI 6.1. But then I took the risk and installed the ported One UI 7.  And voilà — everything worked perfectly. I now have Galaxy AI, Android 15, and all the features of One UI 7.  I still miss LineageOS though — the animations, haptics, battery life, and that fresh UI were amazing. I really wish there were a way to run LineageOS with full VoLTE support.  Samsung, I know you probably won’t, but please allow VoLTE to work on custom ROMs.  Summary of what I did in just 2 days:  Stock → LineageOS → Stock → One UI 7",androidsever,1kn33kj

"What does an iPhone do better than an Android? Hello there!   Been an Android user all my life and I've been pleased with the experience so far. But sometimes I wonder why would I pay for an iPhone much more than on an Android phone while having much less features?   I've noticed that people around me who use an iPhone tend to have a need to showcase their phone, to let everyone know they own an iPhone. When asked why their phone is so good, they usually just say ""well, it's an iPhone"". But my Android phone has 120hz, bigger display, 80W fast charging and a brighter screen (more nits) while costing half. Personally, I couldn't willingfully go looking back to 60hz phones.   As far as I know Apple offers a very stable OS and, as a programmer, I can agree that IOS is somewhat cleaner (both in terms of user and developer experience) but the ecosystem is limited. In fact, Apple has been found guilty of purposefully making devices slower with OS updates and they force anti consumer practices (such as, not allowing people to make their own repairs). Also I heard they stay very good on camera.   But Android is catching up, Samsung lately offers 7 years of security updates on their high end models and other makers offer up to 5 or 6 which doesn't sound that bad.   So, does Apple excel in anything other than ""OS"" and ""Camera"" capabilities?",androidsever,1kmwn5r

"Foldables Are Cool Again — And I Think I’m Finally On Board 🤯📱 Alright, so I’ve been a lifelong tech nerd — the kind who still has their old Nokia N95 in a drawer somewhere ""just because."" I usually upgrade phones yearly (don’t judge), and I’ve always been skeptical of foldables. Gimmicky. Too fragile. Expensive AF.  But last week, I caved and picked up the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6, I think I finally get it. Here's my quick breakdown for anyone on the fence:  🔹 Form factor: Feels futuristic. When I unfold it in public, I still get the “whoa, is that a tablet?!” reaction. It’s nerdy, but I love it. 🔹 Multitasking: Game changer. Running Spotify, Slack, and Chrome side-by-side while tethering from a pocket router 🔹 Durability: WAY better than the earlier gens. Still babying the hinge though. 🔹 Battery life: Surprisingly solid, but yeah, you’ll want a power bank on long days. 🔹 Camera: Decent but not flagship-tier. If camera’s your priority, might wanna look elsewhere.  I still keep a Pixel 9 Pro as a backup for photography and clean Android, but the Fold6 is what I carry daily now. Tech finally feels fun again — not just incremental.  Anyone else here made the jump to a foldable recently? Thoughts? Or are you still waiting for Apple to release one?

"Razr 2025 - USB 2.0 only I have been exploring the idea of using my phone as a desktop replacement since I don't use my current desktop nearly as much as I used to.    I was looking at the new Razr, but noticed that it only supports USB 2.0. This begs the question about support for high-speed peripherals such as a KVM/docking station.   With Google getting ready to offer an enhanced Desktop experience (a la DEX) in the near future (Android 16 or update?), it just seems a bit short-sighted.  Oh well...I guess Samsung  Flip or Fold and Pixel Fold (both offer USB 3.2) are still the only options. I know Galaxy supports advanced peripherals, but not sure about Pixel.",androidsever,1klygme

"It's time to change how companies view their phones. This may not be the first post about this issue, but I decided to bring it back up because I think most of us had completely forgotten about the OEM Lock on Xiaomi Phones running MIUI / HyperOS.  Background for those who don't know / forgot about it: Xiaomi locked the ability to use OEM Unlocking ability behind the Mi Account and Mi Unlocker tool. You would think just download the tool and unlock it? Not easy, in fact, they make you wait a week to get a token, sometimes even reject you for no apparent reason. You would also think just by toggling the setting on will resolve the issue? Nah, even if you toggle on the option in Developer Settings, it will just result in the same thing when you didn't have OEM Unlocking enabled in other brands.  This directly violates the consumer rights, because we should have freedom over what we bought with our own money. Especially if you live in a democratic country. This is just pure violation to the Consumer Rights, especially EU considering them forcing every phone to have removable battery by 2027. I don't know, but I personally think this is outrageous for Custom ROM users like me. It is your right to use whatever OS you want on your phone. Locking it just means pure torture (kinda like Apple, but Im not going deep in this post, because Im afraid my post can be taken down).  So, please help me and others Xiaomi users that are Custom ROM fans to spread this message. It would be greatly appreciacted!",androidsever,1kl7jxp

"Tip: Gemini assistant can be customized using your saved info One of the amazing features I noticed recently is that the Gemini assistant uses your saved info in the Gemini app. This opens up a world of opportunities for the assistant. For example, I added in the saved info to review and correct any typo in the reminders I set based on my location's dialect since English is my second language, and it works wonderfully. I get almost no typos or misheard words in my reminders after this. I also noticed that the reminders set using the Gemini assistant always started with lowercase letters, and this was also fixed by adding my preference in my saved info. I hope some of you found this useful.",androidsever,1kkud5b

"Is an update really an upgrade? Or is it in reality a downgrade!? Gemini Summary:   I used to be all about hitting that update button the second it popped up, excited for new features. But lately, using my devices more, I've realized updates, while adding new stuff (often just for marketing buzz), consistently strip away these crucial small ""Quality of Life"" features that actually make using things smooth. Whether it's changes in iPadOS making tasks harder or losing simple customizations in HyperOS, it feels like updates take away valuable existing functions rather than just adding on. Honestly, many updates feel less like upgrades and more like frustrating downgrades because they keep messing with the useful little things, and I really hate that trend. I know barely update apps/OS, sometimes until the app stops working!   ##**Background:** I’m a tech enthusiast and I am really interested in updating every device or app I have or every device or app of a friends mobile to the latest update whenever it gets released. I am really interested in every new feature that is marketed. I want to try it and be among the first to use it. That’s whether it is Android or IOS Operating System (OS) or normal apps.   That’s all till recently, When I had devices that really update (OS & Apps) and I started using my devices more frequently and updating them to the latest versions whenever released. I started realizing something… in general the update would add some new features, yes, true, some are beneficial or good, but most are, at best useless, just for the buzz and marketing. but also with every update (either OS or App update) they’ll take down minor small Quality of Life (user experience) features that really differ, features that aren’t huge but make a lot of usefulness, at least for me and how I use my devices.   ##Examples  I’ll give recent examples that I remember  1. **iPadOS18** I didn’t update to iPadOS 18 till May 2025, I directly went from 17.7 to 18.4, and man, this is literally still in beta compared to iPadOS17. **Animations** are bad, they took a year to release an **ugly CALCULATOR** (it really looks horrible, I mean apple shouldn’t be baking such stuff) which I never needed (the apple search thing does it much better, yes it does not only search for apps and files, it can also calculate and do much more stuff! Even on older versions! Even on iPhone 4s if I’m not mistaken). The **control center** might look more appealing but having it in compartments I guess is not a big need. The **App CUSTOMIZATION** is literally not cool, it makes the apps look ugly. **Searching for an open tab** isn’t a thing anymore, making it more complicated to get back to the 200+ tabs that I have open! and I guess that’s it for now. Edit: Search feature is still available, but instead of being a button on the top side of the screen you now need to go to the first tab, swipe up to get the search bar. Is this an UPDATE!? 2.  **HyperOS 2** I lost 2 things compared to HyperOS 1, 1- In HyperOS1 I used to be able to **customize the home button** (the circular button in the bottom of the screen that always sends you to the Home Screen) I used to be able to customize it by associating a function when long pressing it, let’s say to Lock Screen or take screenshots for example. But nope, it’s not there anymore. 2nd thing is a feature not available after Android 10, it’s **Sensors Off**. a feature, that, as its name implies, will close/shutdown all sensors. Man! That was a thing back then. 3. **Note Taking App** They are starting to remove the shortcut with 3 fingers to redo the writings, I understand it’s because of bugs, but it’s still an update that’s a downgrade in reality. 4. **Graphic Designing App** I stopped updating it since along time, it became paid and I literally don’t need that paid version, my free version is enough.  5. And so on and so on   ##**Conclusion** Don’t understand me wrong, new features are cool to have and sometimes really beneficial. The idea is why can't they just keep older features and/or build on top of them not screw them and completely ignore their existence.   Some nice feature that I started seeing recently is **actively looking for your face attention**, if present screen stays unlocked, if not screen will lock. Another feature would look at the **orientation of the face** and automatically adjust screen to fit the face orientation, small feature, some might not think about it, but really handy and neat feature.  I guess we should start to care more about those small minor adjustments compared to the bigger picture that’s only for marketing. Maybe this could be a suggestion for tech reviewers out there?   ##**Question** So is an Update really an upgrade or is it a downgrade? I’ll say   Do you agree with this, or did you have any similar experience, or am I just being too harsh on features that no one really cares about.   But I really hate this.   **Disclaimer:** All are personal opinions that might not matter to anyone on earth.    Edit: 1. Added Gemini Summary in the beginning. 2. Re-Organized the entire post! 3. Did some modifications on the text to make it more understandable. I wasn't expecting anyone to really care about this post or even read it so I didn't spend time organising it, I do apologise.",androidsever,1kl8kh7

"Google Find Device is amazing!!! Last night I was with my daughter at a nature park; long after the Sun had set, we left the park, and when we were almost home, she said that she could not find her phone.  I used the Google Find Device program, having setup her account on my phone many months ago.  I could not believe my eyes, as the program indicated the location of my daughter's phone along a stretch of highway that was 15 miles behind us.  Initially, I thought that it must be an error, but as I hit the refresh button, it occurred to me that my little angel had left her phone on the back of the car as she had put on her jacket, which had remained there for almost 10 miles on our ride home before, finally, sliding off.  I immediately turned the car around and headed for the little tiny circle, and after arriving at the exact spot, I hit the ""play sound"" button and could hear it; my joyous daughter was reunited only a few seconds after that.  Her phone lay in the exact middle of the little circle that was pinpointed on the highway shoulder, the little circle outlining a tiny portion of the highway shoulder maybe a meter or two in diameter.  No damage whatsoever to her phone; the silicone case and screen protector had done their job, also!",androidsever,1kiznnp

"Beware: Pixel 9a offers from Amazon - Promotional Credit offer This is a post about ""Buyer Beware""   I bought this phone from Amazon dot ca back on April 12th.  The phone has been great.   The phone is genuine AFAIK.  I got it with a $150 promotional credit from Amazon.  Great.  I thought I could use the offer over time (we buy a lot of stuff from Jeff).    I was looking back at my records to see how much credit I had left.  Most of my purchases have been going thru my credit card....  I can't find my credit anywhere....    I dig further into my emails and find the one telling me I had a credit... and look up the fine print and discover:    I look thru my orders and discover my $150 credit was used on a $18 socket and $19 extension, and then disappeared after that.  \------  Just a heads up if you are planning on buying anything with a ""Promotional Credit"" from amazon.  It likely has to be used in one order.  There is no balance carried forward",androidsever,1kfpn3t

"Gemini Now Saves All Assistant Chats to Main App Just a day or two ago, if I used the Gemini assistant by saying ""Hey Google"" while not using the Gemini app, it would not store those chats in the app. Now it does. That includes things like ""Add bread to my grocery list"" or ""Where's the nearest ATM?""  Not sure how I feel about that. I'm starting to use Gemini Assistant for all kinds of queries and that's going to create a lot of clutter in the app, which I also use for doing more dedicated research and writing where I DO want those chats saved. I know chats can be deleted but that will be regular hassle.  Would be nice to have a settings option for this (haven't found one yet) or have the default for Assistant-queries be Don't Save, unless you tell the assistant to do so.",androidsever,1kd40tf

"Discussion: The step between Apple and Google/iOS and Android Apple and Google have good things and bad things, and although since the Pixel 6 Google has been just a couple of steps behind Apple, there's no doubt that where Apple continues to win is the UIX.  Let's be honest. Apple has not only always been at the forefront of design in its devices, everything about its software(macOS, iOS) always has a much cleaner and more attractive design than its competitors.  OK, with the latest versions of iOS maybe they've made some bad decisions when it comes to customisation(ahem, dark theme), and when it comes to widgets or features Android was ahead a few times, but when Apple does it looks just...better??  And this is where Google-Android needs to do more. Google Keep still looks pretty much the same as it did when it first came out, Drive and Gmail have gone years without improving almost any aspect of their apps. Chrome is just... Chrome. Granted, they're not apps that anyone would want to spend hours on, but they're just plain BORING. The iOS apps themselves may have very different designs, but they share a language that makes you NOT CARE about having to go into them and use them often. Because, to be honest, I'm constantly looking for equivalent ad-free apps that integrate well with the Google ecosystem. And nothing. And I think that's precisely what they need. A visual appeal within all that pretty pixel hardware. An attractive language in basic things. Then we can really say that Google is 100% on par with Apple when it comes to mobile.  I don't know, maybe I'm being too critical or nitpicky? What do you think?  I want to make it clear that I'm not a fan of Apple, in fact I'm usually quite critical, but you have to recognise their strengths.",androidsever,1kdc516

"Android auto workaround: force navigation apps to stay on phone screen ---  How to Keep Waze (or any other navigation app) on Your Phone Screen While Using Android Auto (No Root, No Mods)  This workaround uses a free app called Shelter to isolate Waze in a Work Profile, so Android Auto can't detect and launch it and put the map on your car screen. Useful if you have your phone screen more directly in the line of sight when driving, and maybe you still want to use the car screen for something else like Spotify.  Steps:  1. Install Shelter  Download from F-Droid:   2. Set Up the Work Profile  Open Shelter and follow the setup process  Grant Device Admin permission when prompted   3. Clone Waze into Shelter  In Shelter, go to the ""Main"" tab  Find Waze, tap it, and select “Clone to Shelter”   4. Uninstall the regular Waze app in your non work profile  Go to Settings > Apps > Waze  Tap Uninstall (You can’t fully “Disable” Waze unless it came pre-installed)  5. Launch Android Auto normally (USB or wireless)  Let Android Auto fully load on your head unit  6. Open Waze manually from Shelter  In the Shelter tab, tap Waze to open it  Waze will now run on your phone screen, not the car screen  7. (Optional) Add a shortcut to the cloned Waze on your home screen  Long-press Waze in work all desktop, then you can create shortcut in normal desktop or put in your quick folders etc.",androidsever,1kbj6b3

"Why I’m Switching from iPhone 16 Pro to Android — As a Long-Time Apple User I’ve been an Apple user for years — I had the iPhone 11 Pro and really liked it. But after using the iPhone 16 Pro for about a month, I’m now considering switching to Android (likely the Galaxy S series).  **The main reason? Reliability.**  Out of nowhere, my brand-new ""24 days old"" **iPhone 16 Pro** which I spent a long time saving up for hit me with a **black screen of death**. No drops, no damage — it was just sitting on my desk. I tried every force restart method, but nothing worked. Went to Apple Care they ran diagnostics and found no issues. The phone remained dead until they connected it to their system and somehow managed to reboot it — though even they couldn’t explain what went wrong. One of the technicians mentioned that *four other people* came in **that same day** with the exact same issue on iPhone 16 Pro & Pro Max.  After the reboot, a **new bug appeared** — the phone wouldn’t charge via cable, only wirelessly. That issue didn’t exist before. Apple kept the phone for two days, ran full troubleshooting, and eventually fixed it with a factory reset. No hardware was replaced, but again, no explanation was given.  **What made it worse was the timing.**   During those two days, I had a packed schedule with meetings and client calls — and no phone to use. It seriously disrupted my workflow. For a premium flagship, that’s a big letdown.  Even now, I still get **minor bugs** like random freezing and touch unresponsiveness. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s noticeable — and something I *never* experienced before, even on older iPhones.  I was genuinely excited to come back to Apple and planned to keep this phone for 4–5 years. But after all this, I just don’t feel confident relying on the iPhone 16 Pro as my daily driver anymore.",androidsever,1kc4s18

"How long until we can use our phones as our default daily desktop PC? Hi!  With phones being more and more powerful each year, I wonder when the time will come for the majority of us to use our phones as our default desktop pc at home, just getting back home and plugging it into a dock and instantly getting into a desktop mode for basic daily use like YouTube, docs, excel, email, browsing, etc. All of this with a good and refined desktop experience, without tweaking around.  (Obviously specific software usage and heavy computational tasks aside)  What do you think? Is this expected in the near future? I know there are currently some ways of doing this, but it is far from what I describe here as a default and refined experience, so good that having a dedicated PC will be only for advanced users who require specific pieces of software/functions.

"Anyone here use both iPhone and Android? Curious how you manage it. Hey everyone,  I’ve been an iPhone user my whole life and currently use a paid-off iPhone 15 Pro Max. While I still enjoy the overall experience, I’ve started to feel a bit bored with Apple’s direction lately. Meanwhile, Android has been looking more and more interesting—between foldables, flip phones, gaming-focused models, and crazy camera tech, there’s just so much variety that I’ve never really explored.  I’m not quite ready to *fully* switch to Android, but I’ve been thinking about picking up a second phone just to try it out. I know the grass isn’t always greener, but I’m genuinely curious.  I spoke to T-Mobile and they told me they could set up an eSIM on a new Android phone, and I’d be able to switch my number back and forth between the iPhone and Android pretty easily. Of course, I realize it’s probably not *that* simple in practice—there’s still app setup, message syncing, smart home integration, etc. to consider.  I’d love to hear from anyone here who regularly uses *both* an iPhone and an Android. How do you manage it?  Here’s my current setup (I live in the US for anyone wondering):  * iPhone 15 Pro Max * AirPods Pro 2 (open to switching to something more cross-platform) * Apple TV 4K (keeping this—nothing beats the UI, imo) * Philips Hue lights with Hue Bridge * Eve Flare smart light * HomePod mini * Gmail as my main email (so no issue there)  What I’m curious (or concerned) about:  * How do you handle messaging? I’m not a fan of relying on Facebook Messenger and I’ve never really liked WhatsApp. I’d prefer to use whatever the “default” is for Android—so is the standard Messages app with RCS fine, or is something like Google Messages better? And how does switching between iPhone and Android affect group chats or SMS conversations? Do people just get used to the blue/green bubble shuffle? * Do you use the same apps on both phones, or split duties between them? * How do you deal with notification overload or duplicate alerts (if that's even a thing) from Gmail, social apps, etc.? * Any tips for syncing notes, reminders, to-dos, or calendar events across both? * How do you handle backups and photo libraries—Google Photos? iCloud? Something else that works well across both? * I rely on iCloud Keychain a lot—would switching to something like Bitwarden or 1Password make life easier? * Any wireless earbuds or smartwatches you’d recommend that work well on both platforms? * For those who tried the dual-phone life: did you stick with it or eventually gravitate toward one over time?  Appreciate any tips or lessons learned from those of you who’ve been living in both ecosystems! I've also posted this over at r/iphone but figured I might get some better Android responses over here.   Edit: Thank you everyone for all of your responses!

"Is IOS becoming a better option? Now, hear me out, I've been an Android user for most of my life. In fact, I'm writing this on a Samsung S23 Ultra.  I'm starting to think that iOS and iPhones, in general, are becoming a better overall option. The main reason I preferred Android over iOS was its high level of customization, allowing it to feel personal. However, with iOS, I never had that same sense of ownership.  Recently, with the latest iOS updates and releases, Apple has addressed one of its major flaws (at least, in my opinion). They've introduced features like the ability to change icons from dark to light or adjust colors. While I know Android offers similar options, iOS seems to be much more efficient. To me, iPhones also feel a bit more premium in terms of hardware, and I believe apps like TikTok and Instagram perform better on iPhones.  Moreover, it’s the smaller details—such as iOS's use of depth effects for wallpapers and the dynamic island feature—that stand out.  Are iPhones becoming a better option?",androidsever,1k9b0pe

"Just switched back to Android from using iOS a few years. Google Messages has me considering going back. I'm curious if Google Messages bothers other as much as me, and if anyone else has considered the switch back because of it. I just made the switch from the iPhone 15 Pro Max to the Galaxy S25 Ultra.  Some background, I generally switch back and forth between the 2 OS every few years or so because of either boredom or curiosity of changes. In this case I've been using iOS since probably the 12 until the 15 pro max but was originally an Android guy before that back to the early Galaxy phones, HTC, and Pixels. I'm very comfortable using both phones and see pros and cons of both. For the most part, I've been pretty happy with the S25 Ultra. The camera is great and Android is still all the things I loved from way back. The notification system is vastly superior, I find it even more user friendly than iOS even though once you're used to it, I think iOS is plenty easy. Having a fingerprint reader instead of having to use facial recognition is one of the things I was looking forward to again the most and it doesn't disappoint. There's some weird things I'm realizing aren't as built out on Android these days such as my password manager. I use 1Password and it's nowhere near as functional on Android as iOS. A disappointment but not as game changing as what this post is really about.  Regardless of preference, I think there's no question that iMessage is the gem of iOS. I live in the US and so iMessage is what the majority of people I interact with use. Google Messages has me pretty frustrated, and maybe enough to hop back over. Messaging is one of the most common things I do on my phone, which I'd expect is pretty common. As happy as I am that RCS is here and Apple got bullied into adopting it, it is just not there yet. RCS fails quite a bit and reverts to SMS/MMS which is frustrating, and also lacks a lot of features like swiping through multiple photos sent at once, stickers (not a huge deal to most but my friends love them and they just come to me as full photos), reacting to media, editing, location sharing within the app even though I know I can do it through Maps, etc... Group chats are also a mess and decide to double send sometimes into another thread? When I first switched I sometimes just straight up didn't get some messages that were sent, but I think that passed? I think I'm prepared to blame iOS for those as they're old group chats from before, but I can't be certain. Regardless, it still happens and is pretty frustrating.  Someone confirm this or talk me off the ledge? Really I'm curious others experience with this. Is it as bad as I'm finding it or am I being too harsh? I made the switch over 2 months ago at launch so it's not completely fresh anymore.",androidsever,1k8jskg

"Dedicated proprietary AI hardware buttons are a problem I saw that the nothing phone 3A had a dedicated button for a proprietary AI notes/ chatbot app and I thought it was a disastrous idea. there's not even a browser version so if you wanted to revolve your life around that button and organize things, you can't even sync it with other devices.  but I guess I naively figured this was going to be unique to nothing. now the latest information about the new Motorola Razr came out and that also has a proprietary AI button.  my Lord stop it! it's a detriment to the phone. as we see from nothing it's inevitably going to be used to try to upsell people and become a de facto advertisement button that you accidentally press and I'm sure in many cases it'll require a login just to use a lot of the features.  please don't make this a trend. for years they've been removing useful features like the headphone jack and the SD card slot. they make all sorts of claims about better use of space and easier water resistance but you're now going to dedicate a hardware button for a proprietary AI chatbot which is almost certainly going to be redundant to the default assistant?  obviously if they let us remap it, and I know nothing is not allowing that, that's less annoying but still not optimal.   I'm never going to buy a phone that has a proprietary AI button and I hope this trend stops. I don't know why it would, however,  since shareholders love the term Ai and a hardware button is even more aggressive than just pre-installed software.  frankly with the EU policy coming up it's going to limit pre-installed apps and forcing default services on phones, a proprietary AI button would be an egregious workaround.  tl:dr  proprietary hardware buttons are a deal breaker for me and I'm not going to buy phones with them.",androidsever,1k77ppq

"Do You Publish on Alternative App Stores Besides Google Play? Is It Worth It? Hey fellow Android developers! 👋  I've recently launched a new app on Google Play, but I'm considering expanding its reach by publishing on alternative app stores. I'm curious about your experiences:  * Which alternative app stores have you used (e.g., Amazon Appstore, Samsung Galaxy Store, Huawei AppGallery, Aptoide, F-Droid, etc.)? * How was the submission and approval process? * Did you notice a significant increase in downloads or user engagement? * Were there any challenges or drawbacks you faced? * Do you believe it's worth the effort to publish on these platforms?  I'm eager to hear your insights and experiences. Let's discuss the pros and cons of diversifying app distribution beyond Google Play!",androidsever,1k61r7j

"Why do Android manufacturers only copy, but not steal? Steve Jobs used to repeat Picasso's saying that ""[good artists copy, great artists steal](   What that means is that one may not be the first to do something, but once they did it, they did it so well that everyone associated it with them.   Apple is known for that, usually not the first to do something, but once they did it, it was ""Apple just invented xyz"". Call it marketing, implementation, whatever, they managed to get that association, they managed to steal.   What inspired this post is the copying of Apple's action button, which is the latest ~~innovation~~ change from Apple. I've been watching some reviews of the new OPPO X8 Ultra, [and unsurprisingly, it has the action button](   Them copying is not what's disappointing, I think the action button is a great idea, so why not take it? What is disappointing is that they copy Apple, then stop. They don't actually improve and push the innovation further. They just check off the ""We have it too, just like the iPhone"" checkbox and call it a day. They even copied the look of it. Another example is the notification shade and the control center, [a blatant copy](  vivo has added the action button to their X200 Ultra too, and it looks like they did exactly the same. The same functionality as Apple, and nothing more.   OnePlus is the supposedly ditching their alert slider. I wonder, are they going to improve it? Or will they just copy and call it a day?   Why just copy? Why not improve the feature? Instead of an action button, have a ""super"" button. Add a button that has tactile click, has a touch pad, an ID recognition, has its own vibration motor, maybe make click magnetically actuated for a much better feedback and feel. And then add gestures to it, don't just copy the way Apple's works, add multiple tap recognition.   I would personally add:   - Tap - Tap, hold - Double tap - Double tap, hold - Triple tap  And then give users the ability to customise and assign various functions to these gestures.   That would be perfect and in my opinion, that would be stealing the feature.",androidsever,1k5etgs

"What is the best android phone so far? Some background, i move from a iPhone 15 Pro Max to a Z Fold 6 a few months back simply because Apple is screwing themselves with Apple Intelligence rollout and the stale phone designs every year. Just when i gave Samsung a chance, they screwed up the rollout of One UI 7, heard there are still bugs with it, and so i decided to change to a Pixel 9 Pro where i can trust Google to give me the latest software updates timely.   But then, now I've heard how the pixel camera is the worst in recent years where quality of photos and videos are not up to standard. At this stage, I had assumed Pixels had the best camera compared to the rest of the android phone market (based on what i read).      Which brings me to my question, what exactly is the best overall android phone now in the market, where its processors, camera, battery, software, etc just works in unison.",androidsever,1k4ciko

Ok what about security updates you say? Useless imo, ive never gotten a virus even after disabling the antivirus, I even like to download cracked/modded apps so youd think im prone to getting viruses but I didnt. You just need to know what and where to press so u dont download ""fake"" modded apps which are disguised as viruses.  My suggestion in picking a new phone:  You either buy it for performance,aesthetics,camera or OS   never buy a phone just because it has longer software support as it mostly ruins the phone",androidsever,1k40h1c

"How was it to leave OneUI/Samsung ecosystem for another Android? | Pros and Cons of leaving | Replacement for One Hand Operation+ Hi folks,  **TLDR;** *What are the pros and cons of leaving Samsung for a long-time user? What was your experience like, what did you miss the most, and what workarounds did you find? I am NOT considering Apple. Any good free replacement for One Hand Operation+?*  **Some background:**   I've been on Samsung for very long (about 1.5 decades), and am considering a change to others. Note and S Pen has been a big draw for me, and I need a lot of storage. I don't find spending on S24 ultra of S25 ultra worth it anymore, as I would need a minimum of 512GB storage (currently I have as much on an SD card and another 256 on the phone = 768 GB). I hate good phones not having any SD card storage anymore. I am quite averse to cloud use and use syncthing between my phone, tab (also a Samsung) and PC.  I do not use the Samsung Account at all, so do not use tab-syncing across Samsung devices. I don't significantly use Samsung Flow (Syncthing and KDE Connect take care of most things). Dex use never went beyond testing.  **One BIG concern:** (apps)   ... I have is not having *One Hand Operation+* on a non-Samsung device. I do not purchase from the playstore (don't like my payment identity linked to the phone), so paid apps are a no-no. Are there workarounds to use it on a non-Samsung device, or other apps with similar functions? This app is integral for phone use for me. I change the volume a lot, brightness too. I use it for notifications drop down when in another app, to lock the phone, to move to last app, to list recent apps, to open general search, left side panel for back (a boon when a large phone is in your left hand). I am a creature of muscle-memory and habit driven use. So, this alone makes me wonder if leaving Samsung would be a good idea.  **Samsung Flagships not VFM:**   S24U and S25U with 512 seem way overpriced for regular needs. I'd consider a OnePlus 13, or maybe an Xiaomi or Vivo for their cameras ([comparison link]( or perhaps something much cheaper with a good camera like the [Motorola Edge 50]( (plain version) with which has 73mm 3x optical zoom telephoto, 120 ultrawide, 1/1.56"" main sensor, metal body, wireless charging and a lovely bright 1.5k curved Gorilla screen (we have one in the family and it is lovely with an excellent) which sells for a small fraction of the price. I don't game. Lots of media consumption, Twitter/X, phone calls, downloads, lots of reading. Occasionally marking on screenshots and reverting to queries (that is what I have used the S pen for, but not worth paying a significant premium anymore). Samsung mid-rangers don't seem good enough, as the others are excellent (eg Moto Edge 50)  **Dilemma:**   My concern is that I have not used a non-Samsung for regular use for long, and don't know how painful it would be to be outside the excellent OneUI and love the GoodLock apps like One Hand Operation+ and others. The Tab too is a Samsung. My purpose (as yet) isn't about which phone to buy, but about the pain of leaving Samsung, OneUI, and One Hand Operation+, for a large-screen phone, and possible workarounds for t.   Thank you for reading as long.",androidsever,1k0tn6h

"Updates do not always mean improvements: Things that OneUI 7, released recently, regressed in. I'll keep this really short:   1. A giant battery pill icon has replaced the rectangular battery icon and you can not ignore it. It is bigger than all of the other status bar icons and it is an absolute eyesore. And there's no way to change this.  2. Notifications in the notification panel are humongous. Less notifications fit the screen even though I have the 6.8' inch S24 Ultra. Compared to the notification size in OneUI 6, they are huge. And there's no way to change this as well.   3. The beautiful lock screen music player widget is gone and hidden behind a TINY dynamic pill Now Bar at the bottom of the screen. Before this update, I was able to see my music upon turning my screen on without having to click on anythingv else. Now it is a tiny bar. At the bottom right under the fingerprint scanner. To see the old lock screen player, you have to click the Now Bar. Why???? You can disable the Now Bar but after disabling it, it does not return the old player. Why even let us disable the Now Bar??  Honestly, for the first time ever I have truly regreted updating my phone. I have to tap extra things to get my old experience. Like, why? And it sucks that this is it until if Samsung updates it by OneUI 8 and they might not.  Why take away choice and force change on people without an alternative option?  And did Samsung even ask for feedback about these changes in one of the longest beta testing periods that I can recall?",androidsever,1jy2ux0
"Devs: what is the intended behavior of notifications This is a serious question about the underlying philosophy of Android (not a technical support question) because these practices are so common now it makes me think it's a directive from Google or something.  My understanding for years was that when a notification arrives on my phone, I check notification shade and I have basically three options:  1. Tap on the notification to take action on it right now  2. Simply close the notification feed because I want to deal with it later for whatever reason. (there is also snooze to accomplish the same thing, but not all apps support this yet.  3. Swipe the notification because I want to dismiss it. ""Dismiss"" does NOT mean I want to deal with it later, and this should be clear because we've already covered that in option 2.  So what's the deal with so many apps now resurfacing that same notification 2 or 3 times, even if there is no more information from the app (another text, another email, whatever).  It's infuriating. In most cases, the only way to get it to stop is to disable the app's ability to send notifications at all. So I now you have either a super clogged feed full of repeat notifications, or you turn them all off. Both of these options severely degrade the android experience  Do people like and request this or something?",androidsever,1jyh1ay

"Give me one reason now bar is an improvement over previous live notifications. I'll give you 1. Can no longer see multiple live notifications at once on lock screen. Huge downgrade.  2. Can no longer swipe between media sources (even outside of lock screen) once you open a new one, the previous is gone. You'll need to go back to your home screen and reopen the app. One UI 6 you could have a whole bunch of them in there. How is this better?  3. No viewing of time of track, podcast, video, whatever unless you click the now bar where no other notifications will be visable. So if you want to click your power button and see where the time's at while you're walking you can't just hit the power button and take a look at the time situation. You have to click the NOW BAR. OOOOO THE NOW BAR! Gimme a break   Please tell me how it's an improvement. I'm dying to know.  If you look at points 1 and 2, on one UI 6 you could literally be on your navigation app, and keep track of where you're going, while controlling multiple media players. So let's say you're watching a podcast then a friend sends you a link to a YouTube video or Spotify track and you take a listen and go straight back to your podcast.

"Serious question: Let's say I don't care about security patches, and I hate Material You. What's a good reason to upgrade past Android 11? Android 11 lets me:  * Root easily * Do Nandroid backups (not possible with mandatory encryption) * Use more screen real estate (because the UI isn't oversized from Material You) * Customize my share menu with third party apps (killed in Android 12) * Use an ambient/AOD display with a normal, centered clock * More flexibility with Tasker  Also, as far as I can tell, I can basically do most things that 12+ offers.  Looking at  and scrolling through 16, there are very few must-have things. Scrolling screenshot, maybe? One-handed mode?  I'm a responsible and attentive technical user, so I just don't care about security patches. Without that, is Android 12+ all about visual changes? Because if Material You is the only added value, they can keep it.",androidsever,1jw5vn0

"Whats with OEMs removing useful features from stock android? I recently ""upgraded"" from my dying Pixel 4a to a second hand Samsung Galaxy S22.   For the most part it's a very similar experience. I install Nova Launcher, I set things up the way I like, disabled Bixby etc. Sure, some things are different. The quick settings shade is different, I'm not a fan of how it takes an extra step to access subtitles for audio. Small things but no big deal.  But then I discover that they just... Removed the ability to set notifications as priority. If you long press on a notification, ""priority"" isn't an option.  What's even more confusing, is that you technically CAN do this for SOME apps, but only for chat apps which integrate with the Conversations API, and it feels like a janky workaround. So the system to manage priority notifications is there, and it works, but you can't set any notification you like to be priority. Why??   For extra confusion, it seems the was removed as part of a recent update to OneUI. This feature existed, technically still does exist, but they just removed the buttons and made you need to rely on a separate set of settings to access it in a roundabout way for only some apps.  Why???  This post is as much a rant about this specific problem as it is asking for comments on theories as to why OEMs do this, other experiences you may have had. I'm used to seeing ""extra"" features added by OEMs but why on earth would you remove access to something that's already there under the hood?",androidsever,1jvu0go

"Nothing's new feature, Essential Spaces, looks to have a usage limit. There are also rumours of a subscription being hinted. NONE of this was mentioned anywhere before phones were sold. [Usage limit](  [Support acknowledging this is a real thing](  [Rumours of Essential Space advanced features possibly having a subscription cost](  Haven't seen this anywhere on here which I was surprised by, but Nothing are a small company so its understandable.  I think the controversy is less about the limit and rumour of a subscription, and more the fact that none of this was mentioned beforehand. Some people have bought the new Nothing phone because of the Essential Space feature, **which also has a dedicated button on the phone** (think Samsung ala S10 with the Bixby button).  The company haven't officially come out and acknowledged either issue as of yet from what I can see, but their support has acknowledged the usage limit 'misinformation' (which is a poor choice of words, considering there has been NO information on a usage limit).  I don't have a Nothing phone, I was considering one for my next phone but this really rubs me up the wrong way.",androidsever,1jv1y26

"Best android phone brand in terms of update speed? Hey guys, I own a Samsung S24 Ultra and it gets me frustrated how long I have to wait to get OneUI 7 / Android 15 while just a year ago it was a premium 1200€ phone. When I see the S23 Ultra getting the update even 1 month later, it makes me just sad that I went from Apple to Samsung.  So here is my question: is there a brand that provides fast android updates for their older models?  For example - if someone has a 1 year old or 2 year old Oneplus , Xiaomi etc  do they get the OS updates as fast as their latest flagship or at least in a short time after it?  I find it personally unacceptable, that a 1 year old phone gets the latest OS 4 months later or a 2 year old phone 5 months later etc.. but that's just me and maybe I am nitpicking after being used to be a long time Apple customer.",androidsever,1jutvca
"Internal audio from Google Meet calls no longer recording with Android's built-in screen recorder Hi everyone. I’ve been using the native screen recorder on my Android phone (Samsung S23 FE) to record Google Meet calls for months, with no issues. My setup always captured both the internal audio (other participants) and my mic (via Bluetooth earbuds). But just a few days ago, internal audio from Meet is no longer being recorded — only my own mic is captured.  I double-checked the recording settings and it's still set to “Media sounds and mic”, like always. Strangely enough, if I play a video or music, that internal audio is captured normally. The problem seems to be specifically with Meet calls.  Has anyone else run into this? Wondering if it’s a new restriction from a recent Android or Google Meet update.

After 8 years, 9 months and 5 days, I am no longer employed by Nova and/or Branch Metrics.   >Yesterday, August 7th, Branch laid off 100+ employees in a massive layoff across the entire company. Myself, along with Rob, and many others with great talent were affected.   >As many of you know, and for those that don't know, I worked for Nova for 8 1/2+ years starting back in November 2015. It was one heck of a great, enjoyable ride that I wouldn't trade for the world.   >I'm not sure what the future holds for me personally, but I see this as an opportunity to move on to something bigger and better. Though with the great experience I had at Nova, better seems tough to accomplish.   >Again, this has been an amazing journey over the past nearly 9 years and I am certainly sad for it to end. I'm going to miss so many things about this job. My boss, the users, the customers, the flexibility and of course the amazingly talented people I got to work with along the way!  >I want to give a huge thank you to Kevin Barry himself who gave me this opportunity nearly 9 years ago. I never imagined how this job would change the lives of both myself and my wife. I've done so many things because of Nova that I never thought I'd get the chance to do.   >I also want to say thank you to folks such as Alex Austin, Phil Wall, Steve Blackwell and numerous others at Branch. Alex was the one who brought me over to Branch with the acquisition of Nova 2 1/2 years ago and gave me yet another opportunity of a lifetime and I couldn't be more thankful.   >To all of you, the Nova users and community, thank you for being so awesome and providing great laughs, great times and so much more over the years. Especially to those of you who have ever taken the time to speak in the Nova Discord server. You've brought so much joy to my life over the years and those memories will last a lifetime.  >As for the future of this Discord server, I will have an update in the coming days with details as to what happens next. I hope you'll all stick around for what's next here.  >If anyone knows of any positions that are available in the customer support/customer specialist side of things, please let me know as I would like to get something similar to what I've been doing for the past 8 1/2 years. I would also like it to be 100% remote if at all possible.   >While today is a sad day, the future is bright and here's to whatever the future has in store, which I'm sure will be more awesome things.  [Branch acquired Nova Launcher and Sesame Shortcuts]( about two years ago.    Edit: More context from Rob & Kevin:    Rob:   >To be clear, Nova development is not stopping. Kevin is remaining at Branch as Nova's only full time developer. Development will undoubtedly slow with less people working on the app but the current plan is for updates to continue in some form.  >There is no longer anybody working on customer support, PR, etc     Kevin:    >To address some of the confusion. I'm the original creator of Nova and still employed at Branch to be developing Nova more or less how I always have. However I have less resources.

"*Concluded* I put a Pebblebee Tracker and an Apple Air Tag in a box and mailed it to another state as a side by side test. Here are the results. *\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\**     ***TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***    Original Post:     I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.  Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.  ***Update 1*** **July 3rd**  After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.  Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.  ***Update 2*** **July 4**  As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.  The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.  ***Update 3*** **July 5**  I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.  ***Update 4*** **July 6**  The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.      The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.     **\*Conclusion\***  It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.     The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.     Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.     I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?     I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.",androidsever,1dwpekk

"What does Android offer now that iOS still doesn't? For as long as they've existed, Androids seemed like the more mature system that allows more user customization, granular control over the OS, automation, developer friendly APIs, and overall more flexibility when it comes to alternatives app stores.   Since then, Google has iteratively locked Android down more and more, by taking away existing features or by promoting the manager that made a feature and letting it get killed the next cycle.   Apple (whether of their own volition or under pressure) has gone the other way, slowly but surely opening up iOS to more user customization, alternative app stores, allowing RCS, third-party keyboards, and adding genuinely useful things like lock screen widgets, . Developers are overwhelmingly more focused on their iOS apps and bring features there first with Android apps always getting features later.   Things that were unique to Android like automations are now present (in a lesser degree) in iOS as shortcuts. Developers are all more willing to integrate Apple's new APIs in integration things like Live Activities and Dynamic Island support, while half the Android apps I use still aren't sure whether the navigation bar needs a transparent background or not.   The only places where I feel Android still fares better is with notification management, and the community's ability to circumvent corporate greed (things like ReVanced, Instander, 3rd party Reddit apps). What areas do you feel Android does better than iOS now?  Edit: it's a bit surprising that a lot of people's notion of what iOS is like today resembles what it used to be like 5 years ago.

"Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3 Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive]( into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:    * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says]( ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.  * Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](    * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked]( in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.    * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2]( perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment.   * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed]( from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.    * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key]( meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.    * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.]( Android will then prompt you to set them up again.    * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast]( Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.    * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers]( among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.    * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April]( This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.    * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle]( used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.    * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2]( versus [Beta 3]( In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image.   * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April]( is [here in Android 15 Beta 3]( at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.    * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries]( into visually distinct sections.    * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible]( when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.   A few settings have been renamed:    * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control  * Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control  * The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""    ---     That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.  (By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)",androidsever,1djm806

"I just put a PebbleBee and an Apple Air Tracker in a box and am mailing it to a family member a few states away to test the Android Find My Device capabilities. I did a local test around town today to see if our nely arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.  Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.   *Update 1* July 3rd  After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.  Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.  *Update 2* July 4  As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.  The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.    *Update 3* July 5  I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.  *Update 4*  July 6  The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.  The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.  *Conclusion*  It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.  The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.  Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.  I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?  I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.",androidsever,1du08km

Anyway, it's a big shame as Ron fearlessly held Google and co accountable, and over that 10 years mercilessly beat brands to death for substandard efforts. He famously started here in r/Android and worked his way up.  It's the end of an era in some ways. The days of Android/iOS being interesting enough to do massive reviews and deep dives is over. Android and iOS are not boring but it's no longer wildly interesting to see what's coming next. At Google, Dave Burke who headed up Android for 14 years is moving to ""AI/bio"".      Guys from the early Android era have largely left: Dieter Bohn is at Google now, Ron is leaving, David Ruddock left Android Police a few years ago to do something (I forget what) and is in Germany working elsewhere, Kris Carlon and lots of the Android Authority OGs have moved on - too many to name - but the long experienced and often very critical journalists/writers/analysts have left for other, hopefully greener pastures.

"I put two Pebblebee in my belongings as they were moved 500km across Canada. TLDR: So far they've never worked unless they were near my phone.  I'm moving 500km across Canada, with Toronto being the origin.  I'd preordered a pair of Pebblebee Tag for Android's last spring and they finally arrived a month or so ago.  So I packed the two trackers in different boxes when the movers were here to see if I could track the moving truck as it moved across the country.  The movers finished loading everything early afternoon on Wednesday July 24th and so far they were last seen at 12:41pm on July 24h... The last time I was personally standing next to the truck my phone.  Four nights later there has not been a single update and our belongings are expected to be unloaded at our new home tomorrow morning.  I don't expect them to be located again until I once again stand newer the truck.  The 'Find My Device Network' seems to be missing the 'network' part.  It's just my phone, all alone tracking these.  I was considering getting one of the Chipolo trackers that uses a CR2032 battery for our cat, since it'll be easier for her to escape outdoors.  But what use is a tracker that can basically tell you one of two things: The tracker is within Bluetooth range of your phone' and 'The tracker is NOT within Bluetooth range of your phone.'

"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.  P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.  TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything else  The positives :  Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.  Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.  Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.  World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.  Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.  First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?  The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of. You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour.  Full charge ? Go watch a movie.   Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.  On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.  Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.  But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.  The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.  Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.  Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.  This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.  One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.  Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.  Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.  Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.  TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else",androidsever,1cx66sf

"Honest question, but what do you all do that requires heavy CPU power? (Other than gaming) I see a lot of people on this subreddit who prefer to have phones with as much computing horsepower as possible. I totally get this on other devices like desktops and laptops, but I feel out of the loop regarding cell phones.  I use a pixel which are notoriously ""underpowered"". And while the phone does have issues, I don't know that having faster CPUs would fix those issues. Better efficiency and an improved modem would be nice, but I don't game on my phone. To me, it feels like faster phones are already offering diminishing returns compared to the speed boosts the latest processor used to give you.    Am I missing something about faster processors these days? I'm curious as to why it's such an important feature, if not the key feature for so many of you?

"Chinese Spyware Pre-Installed on All Samsung Phones (& Tablets) I know the title is rather sensational, however it couldn't get any closer to the truth.  For those who are too busy to read the whole post, here's the TL;DR version: **The   storage scanner in the Device Care section is made by a super shady   Chinese data-mining/antivirus company called Qihoo 360. It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).  This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r/samsung]( and [r/galaxys10](  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.  For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.  If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line ""powered by 360"". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [  If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([ The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.  With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \[dot\] cn, wshifen \[dot\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.  Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their ""Big Data   platform"", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).  I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.  After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.  Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?  This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the ""nothing to hide"" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.  **If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.   To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**. We really like your devices, please give us a reason to continue buying them.",androidsever,ektg8u

"YouTube's terms of service are changing and I think we should be wary of using ad block, YouTube Vanced, etc. Here's why... There is an upcoming change to the YouTube ToS that states that:  >YouTube may terminate your access, or your **Google account’s** access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.  While this wording is (probably intentionally) vague, it could mean bad things for anyone using ad block, YT Vanced, etc if Google decides that you're not ""commercially viable"". I know that personally, I would be *screwed* if I lost my Google account.  If you think this is not worth worrying about, look at what Google has just done to hundreds of people that were using (apparently) too many emotes in a YT live stream chat that Markiplier just did. They've banned/closed people's entire Google accounts and are denying appeals, and it's hurting people in very real ways. Here is [Markiplier's tweet/vid]( about it for more info.  It's pretty scary the direction Google is going, and I think we should all reevaluate how much we rely on their services. They could pull the rug out from under you and leave you with no recourse, so it's definitely something to be aware of.  EDIT: I see the mods have tagged this ""misleading"", and I'm not sure why. Not my intention, just trying to give people the heads up that the ToS are changing and it *could* be bad. The fact that the verbiage is so vague, combined with Google/YouTube's past actions - it's worth being aware of and best to err on the side of caution IMO. I'm not trying to take risks with my Google account that I've been using for over a decade, and I doubt others want to either. Sorry if that's ""misleading"".",androidsever,dud2wa

"How Apple removing the charging port scares me as an Android user Let's say the speculation ends up being true and the 2021 iPhone will have no ports. Now, I couldn't care less about what features the iPhone has or doesn't have. I use an Android phone. What I do care about, is that Android phone manufacturers have a bit of a reputation for blindly copying Apple in hopes that making the same mistakes as Apple will make them successful. But I digress.  When you think about it, this situation seems eerily similar to the headphone jack going extinct: Apple realized, that they could make a lot more money by selling expensive Bluetooth earbuds, rather than cheap wired ones, so they removed the headphone jack. And soon, nearly every other manufacturer followed suit.  What I'm afraid of, is that the same thing will happen all over again; Apple removes the charging port, creates an expensive, proprietary wireless charger, and others follow along a couple years later.  Now, you could argue that removing the charging port is just so utterly ridiculous, that no other manufacturer would be insane enough to remove it. But, isn't that exactly what we said about the headphone jack?  My point is, that if Apple does end up removing the charging port, we have to make it damn clear to our favorite phone manufacturers, that we won't let them get away with it. Otherwise, there is a high chance history will repeat itself.",androidsever,e7rbf7

"The new step by step guide detailing how to get started developing Android apps, with no prior experience necessary. Includes every resource I used, simple explanations and an interesting first app tutorial. Everything you need to get started in Android Development is here. A year ago, almost to the day, I compiled a post of all the resources that would be required for a complete programming noob to set out making an Android app. At the time the post was one of the highest on r/Android of all time. This year, having vastly improved my own skills, I’m out to make the ultimate guide to creating Android apps without prior experience.   [Here is a link to the old post, in case you’re interested.](   ##There are two ways of approaching this post:  1.      Be at a computer, follow the explanations and instructions and you’ll have an app and some basic skills to branch off by the end of it. 2.      Just read the post and learn some basic app skills.   **What is Java?**   Java is a programming language like C++, Python and Ruby. Essentially, most apps on the Android platform (most games and other apps are written in different languages) are written in Java. Approaching a programming language without prior experience is challenging, but with a little patience it is doable.    **Java is an OOP or Objected Oriented-Programming Language**   This means that Java is a programming language based on the concept of objects, which are essentially fields of data that can run code and store variables. For example, a String object is an object that contains any combination of letters, numbers and other characters. A String is formatted in quotation marks, here is an example use:       String name = ""Dennis"";       String surname = ""Cometti"";       String FullName = name + "" "" + surname;     After this runs, the variable FullName will equal “Dennis Cometti”.  A String is an example of a basic object, other basic Objects in Java include Integers (any whole number), booleans (a true or false value) and floating points (decimal values like 3.0).   I HIGHLY recommend checking out [this website for a more detailed explanation.](  Objects can also contain other objects and variables, for example you could define a ‘Quote’ Object that contains two values: The actual quote and the name of the quoted person.   **A lot of the fundamentals in Java are essentially plain English**   All of Java is written in English, the structure of the words change but if enough attention is given to it can actually be very easy to understand. For example:       String name = ""DENNIS"";       name = name.toLowerCase();     It couldn’t be any clearer, this will assign the lower case converted “DENNIS” (""dennis"") to the 'name' variable. After you have typed ‘name.’ Android Studio will give you a list of possible methods (like toLowerCase() or toUpperCase()) that can be used, so you get some guidance.   **Classes, methods and objects in Java**   •     A **variable** holds a field of data. A variable might be a surname, your weight or the distance travelled by your car. A String is a variable that could contain “Dennis” and an int is a variable that could contain the number 89.   •     A **method** is a function (like name.toLowerCase()). Basically a method does things using variables or any number of lines of code. You can write your own methods, for example in the app we will be making soon we will be making a method called getQuote(). A method might display a quote on a screen or change the text in a TextView.   •     An **object** holds both variables and methods; one object might be the details of your car, a second object might represent my car.   •     A **class** is a template that holds variables, methods and other objects.   **So what is the difference between classes and objects?**   A class would be a Car (containing no details but rather a template). An object would be your Car (containing all the details about the car).   A class would be a String (containing no details but rather a template). An object would be a ‘name’ (containing the String “Dennis”).   If you are confused, don’t worry, once you have followed the instructions you’ll understand it much clearer.   **Some Java related resources**   - [The basics of Java]( - [The syntax of Java](     ##How do you get started making an app?    **Get Android Studio**  Android Studio is the new (just out of beta) Android Integrated Development Environment, don’t let the words confuse you – it’s essentially a program that has all the tools you need to make an app. Some people come across some issues installing Android Studio make sure you are Googling any issues that you come across in this stage, but you should be fine.  You’ll come across many things you don’t understand when making apps but I guarantee you 1000 people have had the same problem before and there will be help or tutorials online (you shouldn’t need them for this exercise).   #Instruction #1: [Download and install the Java JDK](   #Instruction #2: [Download and install Android Studio, but don’t open it yet.](    **Strings in Android**  Strings as mentioned earlier, are used everywhere: App Dialogs, Titles, Messages, Error Logs and literally wherever you see characters. The problem is, when you are making an app with many Strings it can become quite fiddly. So Google created a solution: a single file that stores all of your Strings in one place, so you can get that one file translated and refer to those strings in tons of different parts of the code. [Here’s a link from Google that can explain it in more detail](    **How Android Studio works**  Android Studio contains all the tools you need to make an app: for this tutorial you won’t be using many. When you create a new ‘Project’ (App) Android Studio will generate all the files and folders necessary to begin a project. [This screenshot shows what it generates]( This looks quite complex but it’s actually quite simple. For example the ‘layout’ folder will contain all the layouts of the app screens you’ll use, which brings us to the next few steps.           #####We are going to make a simple Quote app! It will show a quote plus the name of the person who made the quote and loop through as many quotes as you like when you tap the screen.  >    #Instruction #3: Open Android Studio and click the create new project button.    #Instruction #4: [Follow these screenshots exactly to set up the new project](     #Instruction #5: [You should land on this page, if not, open the layouts folder and click the file inside it](    #Instruction #6: The screen you are on now is the layout screen, if you click the design button towards the bottom you will be greeted with a drag and drop editor. For now replace all of the text in the text tab with this:   This has formatted the layout of the main app Activity, but you can change some things around. Try changing the text from “Tap the screen to begin” to something else. Extra points to anyone who can change the font color.   #Instruction #7: Now we have to make a new class, and the quote Object we spoke about earlier. These screenshots show how to make a new class:   You’ll now land on the empty Quote class, but we are going to fill it with a bit of code now. You will see ‘public class Quote{}’, in between these two squiggly brackets paste this code:   Just click OK to any popup boxes.  What this class does is allows the app to create a Quote object that we can use, you ‘instantiate’ the class and pass through a quote and name (where it says public Quote(String mQuote, String mPerson)) and then you can retrieve the quote or person name later. More on this soon.   #Instruction #8: Click on the Quotebook class here:  Then copy and paste this code in between the onCreate(){ brackets but after all of the other code inside:   You’ll notice some red squiggly lines telling you there is an error, so just under the line that says public class Quotebook extends Activity {  add in this variable/line: int count = 0;  This is what the two sections should look like after the have been copied and pasted:            #Explanation time!       setContentView(R.layout.activity_quotebook);       RelativeLayout touch = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.touch);     final TextView quoteText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.quote);     final TextView personText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.person);     The first line sets the app page (Activity) to be the layout we created earlier. The following lines just declare the Textboxes on the layout we created so we can change the text in them.  ____________________        final ArrayList<Quote> quoteList = new ArrayList<Quote>();        Quote quote1 = new Quote(""You're more of a fun vampire. You don't suck blood, you just suck."", ""Troy Barnes"");      quoteList.add(quote1);        Quote quote2 = new Quote(""Cool Beans"", ""Rod Kimble"");      quoteList.add(quote2);     The first line here creates an Array/List that we can add as many quotes as we like to, note how the List is called ‘quoteList’.   The next 4 lines are where the Quote class we created earlier are coming in to play. What we are doing here is passing a quote and a person’s name (separated by a comma) through to the Quote class and it becomes a variable, we then add that Variable to the quoteList.  ____________________   This is where it gets a little tricky:       touch.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {             @Override             public void onClick(View view) {                   if (count < quoteList.size()) {                      Quote q = quoteList.get(count);                    quoteText.setText(q.getQuote());                    personText.setText(q.getPerson());                      count = count + 1;                   } else{                       count = 0;              }}});     This looks complex but if you imagine it as a plain English sentence it makes far more sense.  *If every quote has been cycled through, set the count to 0 so it starts again. If we have not gone through every quote, get the Quote variable in the quoteList at the count we are up to, then set the text on the quote and person textboxes to the quote data we just grabbed*  If you read through the code and the English algorithm above a few times you should be able to understand what this code is doing.       #Instruction #9: Find the two folders on the left hand side labelled ‘values’ and ‘values-v21’, they should both contain a file called styles.xml In the ‘values’ folder, change the parent= value to be:      parent=""android:Theme.Holo.NoActionBar""   In the ‘values-v21’ folder, change the parent= value to be:      parent=""android:Theme.Material.NoActionBar""   This just changes the App Theme, you could every try change to other themes.   #Instruction #10: To do this next step, you have to: - Ensure that you have your phones USB drivers properly installed.   - [Enable Developer Settings]( then enable USB Debugging.   - Have your phone plugged in and accept the popup that checks if you would like to connect to your computer (Android Studio/ADB)   Then, you have to click the [green play button]( the app will compile and if you have set it up correctly it should send it to your phone and open the app!   If you have issues here, Google your phone + abd drivers/android studio.   #Instruction #11:  Change the quotes around, try and add more! If you have a particular interest in an area change the quotes and make a targeted app like a movie quotes app that has all your favourite quotes or lines.   Change the font, colours, formatting or use. Share your own versions in the comments!   #If you enjoyed that, here are all the resources you need to dive deeper in to Android Development.   **Libraries**   Libraries are like pre-made bundles of code that you can use instead of coding everything yourself. For example the IO Commons library  contains a huge range of methods that manipulate files in one line, like copyFile(), moveFile() and getExtension() instead of having to do them manually. There are specifically made Android libraries from Google that allow you to use newer Android features like the navigation drawer on older devices.   Android Arsenal is a great site for finding Android Libraries:    And here is how to add them to Android Studio:      **More advanced Pro-Tips**   - Stack Overflow is a fantastic community if you have any development questions - but Google it first. - Check out /r/androiddev - Follow Google Design Guidelines. - If you don't really understand some code or how to do a particular task, Google it, comment what you are trying to do and ask around. - Use libraries wherever you can.      **A list of advanced development related resources**   - [A huge resources list](   - [Activity Lifecycle IMPORTANT](   - [Fragments IMPORTANT](   - [More Fragments](   - [Dialogs](   - [Navigation Drawer](   - [Toasts - popups](     **A list of design related resources**   - [Material Design Guidelines](   - [Material Design Icon Downloads](   - [Material Design Icon Index](   - [Design Inspiration](   *Well that’s it for now!* If you need any motivation: I’m 17 years old and started doing this when I was 15.

"**[Moderator Post] Announcement: Subreddit Lockdown in Protest of Reddit's New API Policies and the Threat to Third-Party Apps** Dear members of r/android,  We hope this message finds you well. Today, we have an important announcement to make regarding the future of our subreddit. After much deliberation and in response to recent developments, the moderation team has made the difficult decision to lock the subreddit as a form of protest against Reddit's new API policies and the potential threat to third-party apps.   ##**Why are we implementing the subreddit lockdown?**  As passionate moderators of this community, we strongly believe in the power of third-party apps and their integral role in shaping the Reddit experience. These apps have provided countless users with unique features, enhanced usability, and diverse interfaces that have enriched their engagement with the platform.  However, recent changes to Reddit's API policies and the potential threat of limiting or even phasing out third-party apps have raised concerns within our team and the wider Reddit community. We believe that these changes may hinder innovation, limit user choice, and disrupt the vibrant ecosystem of apps that have flourished alongside Reddit.  By going private, we aim to draw attention to this issue and demonstrate our collective opposition to the potential consequences of these policies. We stand in solidarity with the developers, users, and moderators who rely on third-party apps to connect, share, and engage with Reddit in unique and valuable ways.  ---- ##**I don't use 3rd party apps, why am I being punished?**  We understand that this temporary restriction may cause inconvenience, but we hope that by taking this action, we can shed light on the importance of maintaining a healthy and diverse ecosystem of third-party apps. It is not only the user experience that is at stake; the impact of these changes can also affect moderation tools, accessibility, and the helpful bots that have become an integral part of reddit. If you use the official reddit app, we encourage you to try to understand the benefit these apps bring, and the parity between the official and third parties are leagues differing.  ---- ##**What should you expect during the lockdown?**  During this lockdown period, the subreddit will be set to private for 48 hours starting June 12th, 00:00 UTC [time conversion]( You will not be able to interact with the community at this time. We will evaluate our stance after 48 hours.  ---- ##**How can you join the protest?**  If you share our concerns and wish to voice your support for third-party apps, we encourage you to actively participate in discussions across Reddit, engage with developers, and express your opinions to the appropriate channels within the platform. Let your voice be heard and help raise awareness of the vital role that third-party apps play in shaping the Reddit experience.  Thank you for your understanding, support, and solidarity during this crucial time.  Best regards,  The Moderation Team of r/android",androidsever,143206q

"The direction Google is heading in is frustrating as a consumer Many of us are frustrated at the release of Allo and it got me thinking, I'm tired of Google. Their philosophy of throwing everything against the wall and seeing what sticks is infuriating. They kill apps that could be great (Google Wallet), or they just don't put 100% of their effort into them and then act confused on why they fail. Allo needed one thing to be successful and Google **STILL** didn't listen.   The Pixel phones seem to be focused on the average consumer, but they can't even make a messaging app that the average consumer wants to use in the first place. The rumored price point seems incredibly high for what the phones appear to offer and they can't even update their phones on time which brings me to my next point.  Google can't update their own phones reliably. Android N had months of beta testing and the rollout was still a trainwreck. Nexus 6 owners are  angry and there are still massive battery-draining bugs in the final release. It takes the Android  update system thats already in a poor state and makes it look even worse. Sure iOS10 had a bumpy start as well, but Apple has been fixing the issues consistently. Meanwhile Google is radio silent about the whole issue and has yet to fix any of the bugs that has plagued Android for years.   Finally, Google has appeared to completely have forgotten about Material Design. It's one the best looking design languages but they don't even follow their own damn guidelines 50% of the time. Look at the new Pixel Launcher. It looks convoluted and doesn't appear to match any other design Google has. Youtube seems to change its design every week so I'm not even sure what they are trying to accomplish. Then there's the Play icons (Doritos) that don't even come close to matching MD. I know it's just ""guidelines"" but the idea was to unify a design language on Android so that things were familiar from app to app, and that's just not the case.   I love Android, I really do but I'm just frustrated by Google's choices and they don't seem to have a clear vision of what they want Android to be.  Apple actually knows the direction they want to take iOS, while providing amazing support to all of their devices. They makes dumb decisions also dont get me wrong, but I feel like they have less drawbacks than what Google is doing currently with Android right now. /rant    (Edit: Thanks for the gold strangers!

"Samsung ""space zoom"" moon shots are fake, and here is the proof **This post has been updated with several additional experiments in newer posts, which address most comments and clarify what exactly is going on:**  **[UPDATE 1](  **[UPDATE 2](  Original post:  Many of us have witnessed the breathtaking moon photos taken with the latest zoom lenses, starting with the S20 Ultra. Nevertheless, I've always had doubts about their authenticity, as they appear almost too perfect. While these images are not necessarily outright fabrications, neither are they entirely genuine. Let me explain.  There have been many threads on this, and many people believe that the moon photos are real ([inputmag]( - even MKBHD has claimed [in this popular youtube short]( that the moon is not an overlay, like Huawei has been accused of in the past. But he's not correct. So, while many have tried to prove that Samsung fakes the moon shots, I think nobody succeeded - until now.  **WHAT I DID**  1) I downloaded this high-res image of the moon from the internet -   2) I downsized it to 170x170 pixels and applied a gaussian blur, so that all the detail is GONE. This means it's not recoverable, the information is just not there, it's digitally blurred:   And a 4x upscaled version so that you can better appreciate the blur:   3) I full-screened the image on my monitor (showing it at 170x170 pixels, blurred), moved to the other end of the room, and turned off all the lights. Zoomed into the monitor and voila -   4) This is the image I got -   **INTERPRETATION**  To put it into perspective, here is a side by side:   In the side-by-side above, I hope you can appreciate that Samsung is leveraging an AI model to put craters and other details on places which were just a blurry mess. **And I have to stress this**: there's a difference between additional processing a la super-resolution, when multiple frames are combined to recover detail which would otherwise be lost, and this, where you have a specific AI model trained on a set of moon images, in order to recognize the moon and slap on the moon texture on it (when there is no detail to recover in the first place, as in this experiment). This is not the same kind of processing that is done when you're zooming into something else, when those multiple exposures and different data from each frame account to something. This is specific to the moon.  **CONCLUSION**  The moon pictures from Samsung are fake. Samsung's marketing is deceptive. It is adding detail where there is none (in this experiment, it was intentionally removed). In [this article]( they mention multi-frames, multi-exposures, but the reality is, it's AI doing most of the work, not the optics, the optics aren't capable of resolving the detail that you see. Since the moon is tidally locked to the Earth, it's very easy to train your model on other moon images and just slap that texture when a moon-like thing is detected.    Now, Samsung does say ""No image overlaying or texture effects are applied when taking a photo, because that would cause similar objects to share the same texture patterns if an object detection were to be confused by the Scene Optimizer."", which might be technically true - you're not applying any texture if you have an AI model that applies the texture as a part of the process, but in reality and without all the tech jargon, that's that's happening. It's a texture of the moon.  If you turn off ""scene optimizer"", you get the actual picture of the moon, which is a blurry mess (as it should be, given the optics and sensor that are used).   To further drive home my point, I blurred the moon even further and clipped the highlights, which means the area which is above 216 in brightness gets clipped to pure white - there's no detail there, just a white blob -   I zoomed in on the monitor showing that image and, guess what, again you see slapped on detail, even in the parts I explicitly clipped (made completely 100% white):   **TL:DR** Samsung is using AI/ML (neural network trained on 100s of images of the moon) to recover/add the texture of the moon on your moon pictures, and while some think that's your camera's capability, it's actually not. And it's not sharpening, it's not adding detail from multiple frames because in this experiment, all the frames contain the same amount of detail. None of the frames have the craters etc. because they're intentionally blurred, yet the camera somehow miraculously knows that they are there. And don't even get me started on the motion interpolation on their ""super slow-mo"", maybe that's another post in the future..  EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes (and awards), I really appreciate it! If you want to follow me elsewhere (since I'm not very active on reddit), here's my IG: [@ibreakphotos](  **EDIT2 - IMPORTANT**: New test - I photoshopped one moon next to another (to see if one moon would get the AI treatment, while another not), and managed to coax the AI to do exactly that.  This is the image that I used, which contains 2 blurred moons:   I replicated my original setup, shot the monitor from across the room, and got this:   As you can see, one moon got the ""AI enhancement"", while the other one shows what was actually visible to the sensor.",androidsever,11nzrb0

"'Swiping' to delete a song is ruining my Google Play Music experience EDIT: Here's a better example:   I know I don't scroll 100% vertically but I don't think anybody does. Doing the same in other apps does not result in 'ghost swipes' like this. Also, notice how the last ""undo"" button disappears really quickly.  We all know that the google Play Music Android app is not very aesthetically pleasing or very user friendly but you can get used to these things and I have done so over the past 3 years.  However, there is one thing that is now making the app even more annoying: You can swipe songs to delete them from playlists - at it is very easy to do so without trying.  I can't remember how long this has been going on but I can say that I've deleted a bunch of songs from playlists without know which song it was. And exactly this happened right before I decided to record this video. The 'undo' button disappears as soon as you touch anywhere else on the screen so when you're quickly scrolling through a playlist this happens very often.  Here's an example of how you can scroll quickly through the playlist you've created and accidentally delete songs:    I compare it with another app, 'Relay for reddit', where you can also swipe left or right on tiles to do an action.  In Relay you don't get accidental swipes left or right like you do in the Google Play Music app. How hard is it to fix this, Google?  Edit: I know the video isn't the best example but I was being a little cautious since I didn't actually want to delete any songs because it's a hassle to find them again sometimes.  And while I'm adding to the post I want to let you know that I just deleted a song because I wanted to scroll all the way down to the bottom of one of my playlists 😢",androidsever,7cf8yq

"NFC is the most Underrated technology on planet earth, and I blame apple I remember being super mind-blown by NFC tags when I got my galaxy S3 many years ago. I thought, ""This is going to be the future! Everything is going to use NFC!"". Years later, it's still very rarely actually used in the real world aside from payments. I was thinking to myself, ""Why dont routers come with NFC stickers for pairing your devices? Why don't car phone mounts come with NFC for connecting your phone to your car stereo? Why doesn't everything use NFC to connect to everything else?""   One of my favorite features was the ability to easily Bluetooth pair things. No more ""what's the device name?"" ""Why isn't it showing up yet?"" ""What's the connection pin?"" Just.. *touch* and you're done  Then I realized because if manufactures started pushing NFC, only android users would be able to take advantage of it. Even tho iPhones have NFC chips, they have them restricted to payments only. It's really frusterating to me, our phones already have the chips, it already only costs cents to make the tags, yet the technology goes mostly unused  EDIT: I know iPhones can pay with NFC. That's not the point. I'm saying they should be able to do more then just payments.",androidsever,gisdo5

"Google Play should have an option to report an application as abandoned, especially if it's a paid one There are paid apps on the Play Store that are available for purchase even though they are abandoned by their developers.  For example, i have bought many RSS apps which are now extremely buggy due to that abandonment. But they are still available for purchase.  That's not right.  **Edit**: spelling  **Edit2**: Wow, this exploded. I wasn't talking about old apps that are rarely updated because they might don't need to. I was mainly referring to apps that need to be updated in order to keep working (because they are using some APIs that are changing, etc), but their development is abandoned, although they are still available for purchase.  I'll call this a cash grab (**edit**: if it's done on purpose, i can't find any other reason. Some say that it's hard to unpublish an app. So this needs fixing too). For example, a paid app, with lots of reports for abandonment and bugs, that hasn't been updated for 12 months shouldn't be there.  **Edit3**: I think that some people still misunderstand what i have said. To sum it up: i do not want to force any developer to keep updating his app forever. But when a developer decides to abandon an app and this creation gets buggy due to that (or not working at all), it shouldn't be available for new purchases. Google Play could freeze new purchases until the developer decides to support his application further. Also, for those who say that this would end up being a way to troll devs, i can wrongly flag any app as inappropriate, anytime. I guess that's what Google is for, to examine on a case-by-case basis. Sorry, i can't respond to every comment separately, since many of you post the same thing (but i respect your opinions). But i do believe that many of you are developers with an app that hasn't been updated for a long time, still working though. Don't get offended by my comment, i'm not referring to your apps. Read edit2.  There are 5,500+ points (95% upvoted) right now for this thread. I guess the problem is much bigger than i thought.",androidsever,3rz72e
"About a month ago, my Galaxy S4 caught on fire. Samsung told me that they would replace it. They have ignored me completely since then. 29 days ago I made [this]( post, talking about how my phone had burned and melted while I was sleeping. I was using the official battery and a samsung cable when it happened, and my phone was not under any blankets, or under anything at all for that matter.      Within a couple of days, Samsung had contacted me and told me that they would send me a replacement S4, and a box that I could use to ship my destroyed phone back to them in. During this time they were extremely cordial and polite, and seemingly wanted to genuinely help me. I was happy to oblige, because its only a matter of time until someone loses their life because of this issue. However, Samsung never sent me a replacement phone. Only a box to ship my phone back in.      I have tried multiple times since then to contact Samsung via phone, and through their Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter accounts and have been completely ignored. When I call them, I generally am able to speak to a representative for a total of 5 minutes, and then I am placed on hold for about 30-50 minutes before either my call is disconnected, or I am transferred to a voicemail where I have left multiple messages.      I don't know what route to take in this matter, so here I am again, hoping to get their attention again this way.  --- Edit: Some spelling  Also, to those saying that I should ""wage war"" against Samsung, I would rather go about it in a more diplomatic way than that. I want to give them the chance to do what they feel is necessary. If I feel that it is not, then things may be different. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here, and hoping that a proper solution can arise without a bunch of nastiness.      ---   Edit 2:      A few people have stated that I should send my phone in. I have asked Samsung multiple times when I was able to get in touch with a representative, ""What needs to be done in order to resolve this situation?"" Not once has any of them said that Samsung was waiting on me to send in my phone. If that were the issue, then I am certain that they would have let me know, as I am sure they would like to get their hands on my phone to try to find out what went wrong.      Also, Samsung told me that they would ship a replacement phone out with the box for me to send my phone back in. The purpose of my calls to Samsung, when the replacement phone never arrived, was to find out why it didn't arrive. During these calls, again, Samsung never stated that they were waiting to receive my phone before they sent a replacement.      The fact that they told me that they were going to send a replacement phone out and then did not, combined with the lack of help that I have received in my attempts to communicate with them, have degraded my trust in Samsung.      Another thing for the people suggesting that I send it in, as I stated in my original post, the phone has some functionality still, though I have to to some cable Judo in order to get a charger to properly connect in the charging port, due to the misshapen nature of the charging port that occurred when it melted. If I were to send it in, I would be without a phone, and I cannot afford to run out and buy a new one.      Finally, please try to keep it civil everyone. I know that some of you guys are die-hard Samsung fans, and that is ok. I really enjoyed my s4 up until the point where it melted and burned me and I didn't receive proper customer service after the fact.  --- Edit 3: The fine folks over at HTC have [made me an offer]( that I couldn't refuse! I'm honestly in awe of the amount of support and suggestions that I have received in regards to this issue. You guys and gals are all the best! I will update this thread with pics, so if anyone is still around when I receive my replacement, you can see them.       I really cannot express the amount of gratitude that I have for those of you who offered help and advice for all of this. All that I can say is thank you very much.",androidsever,2bsgkf

"The Magisk Story The last time I used reddit was posting a PSA in [/r/pokemongodev]( which is over a year ago. Recently I started to use this site more frequently, and I'd love to chime in and share some stories I *personally* found interesting. Not sure if anyone would be interested in me and the BTS of Magisk, but I'll share it anyways lol, it also helps me refresh my memory.  ### Who Am I? I'm a 22-year-old Electrical Engineering student from National Taiwan University. You can find me under the ID *topjohnwu* everywhere. Behind Magisk there is no corporation, no massive development team, no professional developers, it's just me, a passionate student that happens to know some coding :D. Starting as a noob, then writing scripts, all the way to developing Magisk, I consider myself far from a pro. I'm still learning how to properly write programs in general, learning the way to manage such large scale projects, and learning how Android works as AOSP is still pretty much a mysterious box to me.   ### Inspiration It all started from [Chainfire's Marshmallow Systemless SuperSU]( (2015.10), at that time I was fascinated and immediately took the boot images and zips apart, becoming one of the first to [port it on a non-Nexus device (M8)]( (2015.11). Root became systemless, but I use Xposed and that modifies system, can I fix that? I tried migrating CF's Systemless scripts for Xposed but in vain: the bind mounts happens too late. I dug into my device's `init.rc` and [official docs]( to understand how `init` boots the system, and after tons of newbie effort I finally found out that `post-fs-data` is the earliest possible boot stage with `/data` access and happens before `Zygote` starts (which pretty much means everything). As a noob it took me half a year to make this concept into reality and released [Systemless Xposed]( (2016.6). In my personal opinion it was a pretty significant breakthrough and maybe sparked excitement to many users.  ### The Birth of Magisk Since the release of Systemless Xposed, I started to get requests from developers to help porting their mods to work systemless-ly. I turned down many devs because the mods requires adding files into the filesystem, which is impossible with only using bind mounts because mounting won't work with a non-existing ""target"". A workaround did come across my mind (still the very core concept of Magisk), and I shared this idea with [Captain_Throwback]( the first Magisk user and avid supporter since day one. He encouraged me to actually put this into practice, so I spent my summer vacation in front of my computer hacking up a [complicated script]( to create a so-called ""Systemless Interface"". Along with a combination of CF's `supolicy`, phh's `sepolicy-inject` and `bootimgtools` for handling SELinux and boot image extraction, Magisk is finally released to the public (2016.8).  ### The SafetyNet Battle At that time, people were complaining that rooting breaks Android Pay. I briefly looked into the issue and found out that it was actually pretty easy to trick SafetyNet at that time. I introduced an extremely primitive method to bypass the checks and bundled it with Magisk. Since then the everlasting battle between Magisk and SafetyNet has started, and the detection rules and policies gradually became more and more stricter. Additional techniques are required, more hacks are added, and some major redesigns to the whole project has been done along the way. I won't go into the details here or this post will be 3 times longer :p  ### Pokemon GO Craze I have to thank this game for Magisk's publicity LOL. PoGO added SN checks in one of its updates, and *swarms* of rooted PoGO players flooded the XDA thread to bypass SafetyNet checks. This was the point when my personal project thrived with a drastically increased user base, and I started to take things seriously. Without this initial boost, I'm not sure how long it'll take for people to recognize my project :)  ### The Beef: Controversy I asked Chainfire in the very early stages of Magisk for some help with SELinux but rejected because he wouldn't share his ""intellectual properties"". With no knowledge in SELinux, I decided to cut a corner in the first few releases and used SuperSU's `supolicy` to patch sepolicy. Due to modifications required in superuser for SafetyNet bypasses and the fact that SuperSU is closed source, there is no way to modify SuperSU and it was incompatible with my SN workarounds. To make things worse and more complicated, CF went on a vacation and I couldn't contact him for adjustments, so this made me turn to the open source [phh's su]( and modified it to work with Magisk. Obviously once CF was back from vacation, he was very upset about me using his work to promote the open source competitor. This of course was 100% my negligent and shows my immatureness. ([Chainfire's response]( (2016.9))  However, I was actually also pretty pissed by the situation. Chainfire took my `post-fs-data` discovery and added it into SuperSU without any credit, and created an obvious competitor to Magisk's SN bypass feature, [suhide]( which relies on running stuffs in the `post-fs-data` stage. For a well experienced developer like him, my discovery might seem like nothing, but as a newcomer it actually took me months of research to figure it out. Later he also distributed my Systemless Xposed zip without my permission to promote his Xposed SN bypass capability of suhide. Ironically enough my effort ended up taken by the ""big guy"" for exploitation to attack me. In one of his posts he also publicly [express contempt for ""that sort of mod""]( obviously targeting Magisk, as ""a few lines of script"". Overall, I was wrong in the first place, CF didn't really hold me liable for the violation, and also I didn't really want to stir drama, so this was never publicly addressed until now.  I'm not sure if there were any misunderstanding between us. I would say this was a pretty unfortunate situation from the beginning, and my immatureness is a huge part to be blamed.  ### Integrating Superuser Very soon I spent a full month learning SELinux, getting ideas and help from phh, developing and enhancing the open source sepolicy patching tool and finally released the fully open source Magisk v7 with all previous releases removed for copyright reasons. Without knowing the secret within `supolicy`, I used a different approach to overcome SELinux. Due to the complications of SafetyNet hiding, treating superuser as an extension was not really that viable, so upon entering 2017, I used the whole month of the Chinese New Year Holiday to fully integrate phh's superuser and done many improvements to modernize the implementation. Magisk officially became a complete rooting solution, attracting users for the open source nature and SafetyNet hiding efforts.  ### Final Words If you managed to stay at this point, thank you for your attention :) The rest of the pieces of Magisk's history could be found in my announcement thread, as I tend to be very chatty in all my release notes (and of course including this post :p)   2017 was really an incredible year, I learned **a lot** in development, Magisk was massively and rapidly improved, and also it gained quite an impressive user base which I could never imagine. Pretty funny is that I bet very few people remember the fact that initially Magisk was only for the systemless interface and never meant to stumble upon the whole SafetyNet business, which eventually led it to become a rooting solution.  I can't be more grateful to Android's open source community as I learned how to do Linux programming from the code of phhusson's superuser and the complete suite of the tools. I am also fortunate to have a group of passionate developers and testers across the globe willing to help me with development and sometimes guide me towards the correct direction. This is why I always keep my work open source, because I believe people should share knowledge to inspire others, just like how I am personally inspired from others to create Magisk.  Looking forward to the future of Magisk in 2018!",androidsever,7oem7o

"Apple declined iMessage for Android in order to keep customers in their ecosystem Source: Epic Games' brief for lawsuit against Apple's App Store (page 21)    Apple has recognized the power that iMessage has to attract and keep users within its ecosystem.  a. As early as 2013, Apple decided not to develop a version of iMessage for the Android OS. (Cue Dep. 92:22-93:1.)  b. Mr. Cue testified that Apple “could have made a version on Android that worked with iOS” such that there would “have been cross-compatibility with the iOS platform so that users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages with one another seamlessly”. (Cue Dep. 92:5-9; 92:11-16.)  c. However, Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering and the executive in charge of iOS, feared that “iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove \[an\] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones”. (PX407, at ‘122.)  d. Phil Schiller, an Apple executive in charge of the App Store, agreed that Apple should not offer iMessage on Android devices. (Cue Dep. 92:18-93:1.)  e. In 2016, when a former Apple employee commented that “the #1 most difficult \[reason\] to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage . . . iMessage amounts to serious lock-in” to the Apple ecosystem, Mr. Schiller commented that “moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why”.

"Google Now just blew my mind (again) So I was just playing around with learning some new voice commands I've never used before. I was reading [this]( article from cnet who have put together a decent comprehensive list of commands you can try.  I was playing around with the 'OK Google, show me some of my photos from...' So I tried some places I had recently visited, San Francisco worked perfectly. Then Spain, all good, this is awesome!  Then I get emotional. Google made me cry. I went for 'OK Google, show me some of my photos from Nice, France'.   She came back saying this to me:  ""According to Gmail, firstly let me express my deepest sympathy to you, your mum and the whole family at your loss. Your dad was a fantastic man, as I am sure you already know.""  Mind. Blown. I'm sad, I'm amazed, I'm taken back. What a lovely moment for some automated robot voice to express it's sympathy to me.   It turns out she read out a snippet from an email I received from a family friend soon after my Dad's death. But the fact that she knew to say it was pretty staggering, it was in the 3rd paragraph of an email sent to me back in December 2010.  Google knows everything, but I'm not scared of it knowing everything quite so much anymore.   **EDIT** - Oh Reddit, you so silly. Proof:

"After the fake reviews, Alcatel is now forcing users to rate an application with 5 stars to use it Unfortunately, seems that Alcatel (or TCL, to be more correct, as they're the ones using the Alcatel brand for mobiles) has crossed another line with its new approach in their Android apps. After replacing the default apps sold with their phones with adware-filled ""alternatives"", after adding those applications into a security update to force them onto the users, after adding a series of fake five star reviews... now comes the time for the forced five star ratings.  In their [Calculator application]( Alcatel now forces the users to [rate the application with 5 stars, before using the scientific calculator options]( Sometimes, I wonder if they simply try to come up with new ways to break their customers' trust just for the fun of it.   **Updates**  There are a few updates I'd like to make to the original post, based on some things that changed and comments on the thread.  * Regarding the comments that this is not an Alcatel application: this was the application that, up until it was removed, was replacing the stock calculator application in Alcatel phones when updating it (that's how I ran into it, as I have an Alcatel idol 4, and other Alcatel users already commented the same in the thread). Replacing the stock apps with these shady versions is something that Alcatel has been doing for a few months: [news item @Slashgear]( [news item @AndroidPolice]( Unfortunately, this is really tied to Alcatel, even though there's a gmail email account as a support link - which also happens in [other Alcatel applications](  * It seems that the unlock worked even if the users rated it with less than 5 stars (I didn't test unlocking it with a lower rating, but there are a few reports of this in the thread). However, since the unlock message clearly stated that 5 stars were required, the vast majority of users was rating it with 5 stars (while leaving comments saying that they were doing it only to unlock the features). This is still against the Play Store's ToS (and a very shady thing to do).  * The application seems to be gone from the Play Store. It is also no longer showing in my Idol 4 (as of this morning).  * In my Idol4, the update notification for the other Alcatel stock applications has disappeared. I'm not sure if there's any relation to this situation. Up until now, I had update requests for all the stock applications to turn into their ""spam"" alternatives, but now they're not even listed under my installed apps. Can other Alcatel users confirm if the same is happening to them?  * The developer seems to have a [second version of this calculator]( currently up. I'm not sure what's different or if it also has the rating demand. However, this second version doesn't seem to replace the stock app when updating OTA on Alcatel phones.",androidsever,8evllk

"Samsung refuses to issue me a refund, has had my phone for 26 days and counting. I bought my Note 7 through Swappa and a day later it was recalled for the second time. I sent in my phone to Samsung and they received it on the 20th of October. It has been 26 days and I have not received a refund or any sort of useful information.  When I initially sent in the phone I was told it would take 2-3 business days. Then when 3 business days came it got pushed to 3-5 business days and well you get the picture.  It has now been 26 days since they've had possession of my phone and not a single person at Samsung can explain to me why I have no received a refund or whether I am even getting a refund. All the managers I've escalated the situation to have told me ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do, you just have to wait.""  Samsung does NOT care about its customers, all they want is to get their phones back and not refund you for them.   I am not alone, on the Note 7 subreddit and xda-developers no one has received a refund yet either.  I want to get the word out there to let everyone know how Samsung is treating its loyal customers. Please never buy Samsung again. People deserve better.  edit: The most frustrating part is how Samsung has no answers. Every representative or supervisor I've spoken to the last 3 times has told me they don't know why I haven't received my refund and they have no way of investigating and finding out why. I've worked in customer service before and it boggles my mind that they think it is acceptable to just tell a customer ""I don't know."" and that's the end of it.  edit2: There is a thread on the android central forums with plenty of people in the same situation as me. No one has received their refund or answers.   edit3: I see a lot of people telling me to do a charge back. That would just screw over the original person who sold the phone to me, not Swappa. The Note 7 is being recalled for safety concerns, so whether I bought it from Samsung, Swappa, or a man in a parking lot, they are responsible for it. They are the ones pushing every user out there to return their Note 7s as soon as possible, so they have to take responsibility for making things right.  If you bought a used car from someone and the car exploded while you were driving (due to a manufacturers defect) are you going to hold the person who sold it to you responsible? or the manufacturer of the car?",androidsever,5d7dan

Keep in mind, I have already disabled affiliate links in my reddit preferences in my browser so there are no Reddit affililate tags being added to my outbound clicks.  It wasn't; the URLs were different.  There was no affiliate link; the mod was right.  I then started trying out all of the Amazon links I could find using Sync.

I then tried to create a text post asking about it, making sure to use the correct flair and information.  This post was automatically removed by AutoModerator due to their filtering rules.

My daughter was born in December 2015.. and since then, I have taken lots of photos and videos of her around the house with my phone.. first time she crawled, sat upright, etc etc. Google Photos sometimes made a collage of photos or animations.. but what it did today was unfathomable.  Fuck you Google Photos.  You made a grown ass man cry like a baby by automatically making a video titled ""They grow up so fast"".. which has about 45 clips of videos with my daughter in it.. aged around 4-5 months to 22 months (current).  I have watched that 3 minute long video 3 times so far.. first time while I cried like a baby.. next two times with my jaw dropped due to the technology that made this possible.  I know Google Photos is not an ""Android"" topic.. but when it's the same company who makes both, you know you'll be in good hands.  I <3 you Android.  Sincerely,  Your forever customer.",androidsever,72jujt

I'm asking to all users here to give visibility to this posts, and to the admins to stick it to the top of the subreddits. Please do not underestimate this problem. Act now.  &#x200B;  [  &#x200B;  ***Edit 1***:  ***TL;DR:*** Google Play Store bans developers randomly and doesn't care about appeals (automated rejections). So many indie devs don't try to develop and release Android applications, because it is too risky to do.  (thanks /u/Zhuinden)  &#x200B;  ***Edit 2***:  /u/Zhuinden proposed to use the following tags in social media: [\#androiddev](  [\#IndieDevsMatter](  &#x200B;  **Edit 3:**  Someone suggested to ping famous celebrity to speak out on this.

Please ping any celebrity/news channel that you can think of, via private message or social media.  &#x200B;  ***Edit 4:***  I've been trying to reach some of the most popular Android news channels, like Android Police and 9to5google, to ask them to cover this story. (**edit**: Android Police said that they are not interested in this story. OK... Personally I'm not longer interested in their stories neither).   But now I need to sleep, so I ask anyone that care about this topic to write a quick message/tweet/email/video/anything to all news platforms that they can think of (even the big one). We need to get as much visibility as possible, and a small effort from each of you could make the difference.  We need to stop complaining and start to do something about this.  &#x200B;  ***Edit 5*****:**  I found a way to directly write to the European Commission, so I did it.

All the Android phones in the market come with the Google Play Store installed on them, as main and only source to install apps, and the distribution via alternative channels is purposely made very complex or impossible for the average users.   >   >Furthermore Google can determine LIFETIME bans for private developers and companies from publishing apps in the Google Play Store, basing them on their own policies often kept intentionally obscure. The bans often come without any explanations or chance to appeal.   >   >With the growing importance of mobile apps and mobile communication more and more key services are dependent from this platforms. I believe that, for the good of free competition and freedom of expression, the EU should intervene and regulate this monopoly. For example by giving the users the chance to easily select what apps store they want to use, and by giving companies the chance to not be totally dependent from a single private institution (Google) for the distribution of they services.   >   >This is an important issue, please do not underestimate it.   >   >Thank you and best regards,   >   >/<name and surname>   >   >P.S.   >   >This topic has been raised also in a popular social platform (Reddit), where is possible to read witness about the extent of this issue:   >   >[   >   >[  &#x200B;  ***Edit 6***:   I got an answer from the EU:   >Dear Mr.<surname>,   >   >Thank you for contacting the Europe Direct Contact Centre.   >   >We would like to inform you that the European Commission is aware of the situation and that there has been steps taken towards the ending of unfair practices.

What we're asking to Google is to stop this unfair practices by:  * Being more transparent about the suspensions processes;  * To stop this life-banning madness;  * To stop banning associated accounts.

"Uninstalling Facebook Speeds Up Your Android Phone - Tested Ever since Russell Holly from androidcentral re-kindled the age-old ""Facebook is bad for your phone"" debate, people have been discussing about it quite vividly.

I chose 15 runs.  * Reboot before each run to keep things fair * Tested apps: 20 Minuten, Kindle, AnkiDroid, ASVZ, Audible, Calculator, Camera, Chrome, Gallery, Gmail, ricardo.ch, Shazam, Spotify, Wechat, Whatsapp. Reason: I use those apps often and therefore they represent my personal usage-pattern. Everybody can use DiscoMark to these kind of experiments, and they might get different results (different phones, different usage patterns). That is how real-world performance works. * The absolute values (i.e. speed-up in seconds) are rather meaningless and depend heavily on the type of apps chosen (and whether an app was still cached or not).

"My nexus 6P was stolen today. I am one of those dumb people that uses my phone as my wallet. So I have my employee card, along with my bank card and my ID-card with the phone.  I took the bus today after the gym, used my phone on the bus, since my phone holds my buscard. I stood up the entire ride, since the bus was crowded with people. I didn't notice the guy sliding his hand into my pocket and nabbing my phone. So I walked for two minutes, on my way home after hopping off the bus to come to the terrible realisation that I've been robbed.  So, panic sets in. This guy now has my bank card, my ID card (which means he has my full social security number) amongst other things. So I run home like a maniac. I know that i've not ""dropped"" my phone, I somehow knew that i've been robbed.  Fast forward: I'm home and I ask my boyfriend to call my cellphone. My boyfriend's name on the phone is ""*authentic name* (Boyfriend.) ""  Two signals in and the guy clicks me. I try again and he's constantly clicking me. At this moment, panic sets in. Then I remember that google has this neat feature where I can track where my phone is. I sit down by the computer, lo and behold, my phone has made it's way to some place 20 minutes away from my home. I call my friend and asks if he's able to drive, he agrees.  I grab my friends phone and log in to the google service and spam call my phone through there, just to be an annoyance. We arrive outside a house, knock on the door and there's a woman in her mid 40's by the door. She asks what's up, and I ask her if she has any children. She mentions that she has two son's and I ask to see them both, and explain the situation for her.  Well, the perp in this situation was the 16 year old son, who later on admitted that he had picked the phone through my pocket, and then panicked once he noticed that the phone kept saying ""Android device located"". The shock on his face when he saw me by the door was priceless, he actually didn't think i'd find my phone.  I want to point out that the  [Android device manager]( is a great tool and that if you ever lose your phone, use it. It's fantastic!  Also, don't have all of your private cards attatched to your phone, use a wallet. I know I will from now on.   **EDIT:** My frist gold, thank you!  I've gotten the Cerberus app after several recommendations.   PS:  Since I was not clear enough, my phone does have fingerprint unlocking and a pin code to it.  The thing is, my phone case is my wallet, where I store my cards in. Or used to. From now on i'll just have a seperate wallet!  Thank you guys for such great tips!  **Edit 2:** Yes, I am a boy, I know I wrote boyfriend in my story, You don't need to send messages to clarify if I'm gay or not, since that has nothing to do with the story.  I am not saying "" Go after the perp who's stolen your phone"" when you've located it on your android device, What I am saying is that it's a useful tool to have in order to track down your stolen phone. And it works if it's in your neighbourhood so-to-say. Or city, you name it. Because then you know most of the maps & places. Bad parts of town, etc.",androidsever,5gcjo1

"PSA: If your Google Opinions app stopped sending you surveys, check the app's location settings. I see people say all the time the Google Opinions app stopped sending them surveys some time ago.

Make sure the ""location"" is toggled on.  I did that, and started getting surveys a few days later, after not receiving them for months.  I think the root cause has something to do with the new app permissions set up in Marshmallow.  Somehow when you install, it doesn't toggle the location setting on automatically.

"My community-driven game removed by Google Play through false DMCA notice. Appealed twice, ""at this time, Google has decided not to take action"" twice. **UPDATED: 18 hours after posting this thread, Google finally reinstated my game. See bottom of this post.**  &#x200B;  I am the developer of [Cytoid]( a community-driven music game released on Google Play and App Store. Similar to how ""osu!"" works, players can use a level editor to create levels for Cytoid. We don't want people to use Google Drive or Dropbox to share their levels, so we also host a level sharing website, [CytoidIO]( which runs independently from Cytoid.  &#x200B;  Earlier this month, some copyright holder has emailed us, stating that some of our user content on CytoidIO is infringing their copyrights. They also sent DMCA takedowns to App Store and Google Play as well, and Cytoid got removed from Google Play (App Store didn't remove it immediately but started a dispute process). Now, two things:  &#x200B;  1. They are filing a DMCA to Cytoid, which is technically unrelated to CytoidIO; yes, there is a link to CytoidIO in Cytoid, but that's all. 2. By [relevant DMCA laws]( service providers like CytoidIO are immune from liability of copyright infringements resulted from user content, as long as we follow some rules (automated uploading, no financial benefits, remove copyright-infringing materials expeditiously), which we all did.  &#x200B;  In fact, we quickly reached a resolution with the copyright holder, and they agreed to withdraw their DMCA notice from Apple. However, they claim that they couldn't withdraw from Google because Google doesn't provide an official way of doing it. (It is indeed true.) I then filled out and submitted the [DMCA counter-notice form]( to Google, explaining about the situation. Two days later I got this email:  &#x200B;  >At this time, Google has decided not to take action. We encourage you to review [ for more information about the DMCA.   >   >If you have legal questions about this notification, you should retain your own legal counsel.  &#x200B;  Fine. We then consulted a copyright lawyer and **wrote a formal** [**DMCA counter-notice**]( **letter**, even mentioning some of the applicable DMCA laws. And just 30 minutes ago, I got the reply:  &#x200B;  >At this time, Google has decided not to take action. We encourage you to review [ for more information about the DMCA.   >   >If you have legal questions about this notification, you should retain your own legal counsel.  &#x200B;  The bots at Google don't seem to care about us.  &#x200B;  What should I do? Is this purely a bot issue, or there were some issues with our counter-notice letter? People online are saying to file a lawsuit to grab Google's attention, but I am only an university student and have no money or time. Please help.  &#x200B;  Links:  [Cytoid on App Store]( (our description on App Store is identical to that of Google Play, so I put it here to serve as a reference)  &#x200B;  **UPDATE:**  I just received an email from the removals team:  &#x200B;  >Thanks for reaching out to us.   >   >Pursuant to the counter notification you sent us, we have reinstated the following URLs:   >   >[   >   >Apps may need to be republished in order to be visible to users.  &#x200B;  Judging from how fast they responded (it took more than 3 days in the past), I am pretty sure that wasn't a bot this time!  &#x200B;  To be honest, I literally teared up a little bit when I saw the reinstatement email. **From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much to everyone who upvoted, commented, shared the story, and provided insightful advice. I really, really appreciate it.** I know this incident alone is not enough to fully push Google into changing their attitude towards small developers, but hopefully it helped, even just a tiny bit.  &#x200B;  I have so much more I wanted to say, but I really have to go now! I will update the post tonight with more of my aftermath thoughts.  &#x200B;  **UPDATE 2:**  So here I am, one day later. The main game is finally back on [Google Play]( although our game servers (including the website) are currently under maintenance and will be back online on Friday morning.  &#x200B;  Regarding the game's future: obviously I will start publishing the game on more platforms, including F-Droid like many have suggested. **The reason why I didn't publish it everywhere was because we are a non-commercial open-source game** \- we don't earn money by reaching out to more users, so we wanted to make the game cater to a wider audience first. Currently, if you aren't a professional music game player, you won't find much fun in Cytoid: most of our fan-made levels are really, really difficult, so we are working to bring a proper learning curve to the game (like a progression of easy->intermediate->hard levels). We are also teaming up with indie artists to use their music in our game, giving more exposure to them and their work. You can follow our development on [Twitter]( (Most of the time it's just our mods joking around, though.)  &#x200B;  As for this incident - once again, I am truly grateful to /r/Android and everyone participated in this thread. From my email exchanges with some Google employees that contacted me, this Reddit thread definitely attracted Google's (or their PR bot's) attention. I might have to give up on working on the project if not with your help. You saved the dream of an indie developer. **Thank you. 🙏🏻**",androidsever,b5x4cr

"I was attacked and robbed, Google's ""Find my phone"" is worthless against thieves. Long story short, I was attacked and robbed, and the attackers took my phone. Being the avid tech enthusiast I am, I knew google had a service to track, erase data, and more, but I had never used it until after the attack and theft.  So why is it worthless? It 100% relies on your attacker/thief being a complete moron. As soon as they can, they can turn on airplane mode, via the lock screen (works on 3 phones I tested), and that defeats it, or they can simply power the device off, either via a hard shutdown or software off. So essentially the only stock way of retrieving your phone or tracking the thief is stopped in 3 seconds with common sense.  So I propose an OPT-IN feature, that disables access to quick toggles when your phone is locked, or at least ones that disable this feature (airplane mode, gps, wifi, cell data). It also disables software and hardware shutdown at the *lockscreen*. Now this bit is admittedly going to be difficult for some to accept, which is why its opt-in, but the only time youd *really* need this is if your phone froze at the lock screen, which to me I havent suffered a hard freeze in 5+ years, but would result in you needing to wait it out.. Hence why it should be opt-in.  Another thing I take issue with is the fact that if your phone cant be tracked, you have to choose what you want to do. Wait longer and try to track it, or factory reset the phone. One leads to possibly finding the criminal, while the other secures your data. You shouldnt have to compromise here, there are numerous ways to fix this, but the answer should never be 'choose one'.   **TLDR; Googles ""Find my phone"" is only really useful for innocently lost phones, but it shouldnt be that way.**",androidsever,8kwg35

"Motorola has not been able to fulfill a warranty exchange for the Moto G, X, or 360 for at minimum the past 2-3 months because they ""have no replacement devices in stock."" We need to pay attention to this type of consumer treatment. Many examples in post. **Edit #3: I’ve been contacted by and talked with a class action law firm about my issues with Motorola/Lenovo. The firm’s name is Girard Gibbs and they are actively investigating this case and would like to hear from others that are experiencing problems with warranty service from Motorola. If you want to contact the firm, send an email to: eyn@girardgibbs.com.**     Very briefly I will relate my interactions with Motorola over the past 2 months and try to keep it from being my personal story.  This is not a thread about one person complaining about the customer service they received.  But the ordeal I am going through with Motorola in order to execute a simple limited-warranty exchange lead me to discover a much bigger issue.  Motorola simply can't honor the warranty on their devices because they don't have replacement devices in stock.     I know for a fact that they have had no stock of the Moto G 3rd Gen, The Moto X Pure Edition and the Moto 360 and probably other devices for at least the past two months (I was directly told this by someone of 'Executive' status in the company).  But from all the other complaints I found on Moto forums, reddit and various other sites, it's apparent that this has been an ongoing issue for a while now but has become very problematic since January.  Coincidentally, it was announced in January 2016 that the name ""Motorola"" would no longer be used for the public, i.e. Lenovo is phasing out the brand names Moto and Motorola.  I have an in-warranty Moto G 3rd gen that started malfunctioning to the point of it being hit-or-miss if it will work.  Two months ago I was authorized for an Advanced exchange to get the device replaced. [The program says it takes a maximum of 4 business days + shipping time]( for the replacement to arrive.  Weeks passed with no communication from Moto, I had to hound them over and over to find out what the status with my case and was and eventually found out they had no stock of Moto Gs for warranty exchange.  They tried to look for similar devices (The Moto X Pure Edition) and they were out of stock of that too.  And after some searching, the same is true for the Moto 360 as well.  Here are some quotes with their sources:    *  - Read a few, skim the rest but no need to go beyond the first page.  You get the idea pretty quick.   * [I sent in my black, metal band Moto 360 (1st gen) to Motorola over a month ago when it stopped powering on. They received it and I didn't get an update for 1 month so I called them and they said they are out of stock but they could offer me the champagne colored watch - I refused since I would've bought that color originally if it was what I wanted. Anyways, they said to wait 2 days to see if they get more in stock - I waited 11 days (I was very patient) and called today and they said they still don't have any in stock.](   * [Three months after purchase, phone stopped working entirely (no water or physical damage). Sent it in and was promised to receive a new phone within 5 days. 10 days later, I called their support line to ask about the delay. They said it would take another 7-10 business days. Today, after an additional week, I called to inquire, and another rep told me it would arrive in two weeks. Worst service I have ever experienced. This is my third Motorola phone over five years, and after this experience, I will never buy a Motorola product again. Still waiting for my phone. 4/4/16](  This link has a ton of other people reporting similar issues.   * [Today (4/11/2016), I called the RE Team again to get an update, and happened to reach Marlin again. He had nothing to update me with because the status was still the same: there were no replacement phones available at the wharehouse. He apologized several times, and understood why I was upset. Then I asked him if replacement phones haven't been available for a month, and customers are out there waiting for a replacements, why not give them a new phone. **His response was that the team wants to do something like this, but Corporate has told them no discounts of any kind are to be offered and no new phones are to be offered.**](  Scroll through the rest of the [Moto X forums]( and check out the other device forums as well.  You'll see complaint after complaint of people waiting weeks/months for Moto to get stock of their particular device to fulfill their warranty exchange.   * [During this entire span of about 1.5 months, I was forced to go buy a temporary phone. Not only that, but Motorola charged me the full price of the replacement since they haven't received the original defective phone. I've spent hours & hours on the phone and via email with support and they've been rude, forgettful and unaccomodating. In fact, this is by far the worst support experience I've had with any company in my lifetime. After looking through Better Business Bureau reviews, looks like I'm not the only one who has gone through this.  Any ideas on ways I can finally resolve this issue? I'm tempted just to bring my lawyer in or submit an inquiry to some consumer watchdog groups.  Thanks!](  There's a plethora of evidence out there showing Motorola's unwillingness to keep the legal promises made in their limited warranty.  If you need to use your warranty, be prepared to spend hours on the phone and weeks of waiting.  You can call them and speak to supervisors and get your case escalated but you'll only end up listening to same lines repeated over and over - ""sorry we're still out of stock all we can do is wait for stock then we'll ship your replacement"" (which will be a refurbished phone).     Threatening legal action or contacting consumer advocacy groups seems to occasionally produce results from peoples' testimonials.  That or leveraging social media to your advantage.    BTW I'm not writing this in the hope it will personally help me with my issue.  I'm writing this so Motorola device owner's will know that the 12 month limited warranty that came with their device is virtually meaningless.  And I'm hoping this post gains attention so more people are aware of Motorola's practices.  I'm not a lawyer, so I can't say if their practices and policies are illegal or not, (in my opinion immoral, but that doesn't mean anything) but from the research I did there are state and federal laws designed to protect the consumer and ensure the warranter honors the agreement.    On the Federal level there is the [Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act]( and the laws will vary state to state.    So hopefully I got my point across.  This isn't a call to action.  This isn't a person complaining about their customer experience.  The primary purpose of this post is to serve as a warning to /r/Android (and any other sub I xpost to) of what to expect when dealing with Motorola's warranty service and to facilitate discussion about recent experiences with Motorola's warranty service, even if it's contrary to my experience and all my citations.  Are they intentionally doing this?  Is it just a shortage of inventory due to change in ownership and facilities?  What do people think?  And I must confess, I have a secondary purpose for writing this.  it is the small hope that this post will gain attention and affect some type of change.   Thanks for reading.  Oh and here's the actual warranty:    [Motorola's Moto G 3rd Gen Warranty](    >  2.  If  the  Product is  still  not  functioning  properly  after  you  have  followed  troubleshooting  instructions suggested  on  this website,  please  contact Motorola using  the  contact  details  provided  on  the  customer support website at **[insert url]**.    Gotta love that attention to detail in a legally binding document.  **Edit #1**: it's interesting how many of you are bringing up Lenovo and their reputation for having terrible customer support, especially when it comes to warranties and repairs. I actually had just as negative of an experience with Lenovo regarding a laptop, and as a result I will never spend another dollar with Lenovo.  The thing I find funny was that I had to send my laptop to Lenovo for repair in Fort Worth Texas. Well guess where Motorola's repair and warranty center is now? Fort Worth Texas.   And not to get too personal, the laptop I received back was completely non-functional, as in if you had pressed the power button you would have seen it didn't even turn on.  And in my links above you will see plenty of people complaining about sending their phones to Fort Worth for repairs and getting non-functioning phones back.    I recall one person talking about their Moto G no longer getting a signal, so he sent it there for repairs and when he got it back they had replaced the power button on the phone.  Capitalism is like democracy, you vote with your dollar. If you don't like the way a company does business then don't ""vote"" for them.    **Edit #2**: Looks like a news site picked up on this thread.   *     *     *       *     *     *   I only hope more do the same!  Thanks Paul K.  Maybe if a few news sites pick up on this and contact Motorola, we will actually see some change in their behavior.  If any more sites do an article on this, I'll add the links to the OP to keep people updated.    Also thank you to everyone who posted their stories, I had no idea there were this many disenfranchised customers who have shared a similar experience to mine.",androidsever,4eul0o

"What apps that you like have either gone obsolete, or got ruined by their devs Sometimes our favorite apps get sold and killed, or the dev abandons them, or the company/dev ""update"" it, ruining it in the process.   Do you have any apps you use that share a similar fate?  Here are few examples of apps that I like that got ruined or abandoned.   - [Skitch]( was an awesome photo annotation app. It had good selection of tools, but what really make it awesome was how easy it was to use, and how nice those annotations looked. There was something so [smooth about the text annotations, arrows, and pretty much all the other tools it had]( Then EverNote bought it and proceeded to kill it. There is a nice app now on Google Play called [Annotium]( which has more tools but it's not as easy to use, and I think the end result is not as pleasant looking as Skitch.  - [SnapSeed]( - Google has not updated it meaningfully in a good while, I feel like it's going to be added to Google's kill list any day now. There is still nothing that is simple, does not require accounts, or an Internet connection, yet feature rich like SnapSeed. It also supports image overlay, and its editing undo feature is the best I've ever seen on any app.  - [Anything to PiP]( - A great app that let you send anything to PiP, as the name says. You could send images, videos, YouTube videos, and have them as a floating window. For some reason it vanished from Google Play.  - [Glympse]( - Was a great app, and still is, but they went ahead and redesigned it, ruining the UI in the process. Even the UI graphics are low resolution, not sure how the redesign was approved.  - [HERE WeGo]( - Another app that got ruined by a redesign. The new app looks great, but the problem is that it lost features from the previous app (driving mode, can't display what info you want displayed when navigating), and when you using car navigation the view is top down. You can try to manually tilt to look 3D so you can see what's ahead, but it still resets to the top down view in a few seconds, rendering the navigation part of the app useless. Transport navigation is also not updating live from you go from station to station. The worst part is that they have not done any meaningful updates in years and do not listen to any feedback. The app is just hanging in there.  - [Stitch & Share]( - Used to be a great app until the dev went ahead and redesigned it, breaking it, and removing features too. Then abandoned it.  - [WPS Office]( - This used to be the smoothest office app on Google Play, even Google Docs and Microsoft Office were not as smooth. But they ruined the context menu and other things with updates.  - [List My Apps]( - Super useful app, but last updated in 2016. It does not even need anything, I just hope one of the new Android versions do not make it obsolete.  - [Simple Gallery Pro]( - The best gallery app on Android, even better than QuickPic that it supplanted. But it sold, and I feel like there will be only minor bug fixes from now on.",androidsever,1e9tnt9

"UNPOPULAR OPINION: NOTHING AND CMF is all hype and no innovation. Let me preface this by saying I'm excited about new players in the smartphone market, but there's something about Nothing's approach that rubs me the wrong way.  Here's why:  * **Apple Comparisons Everywhere**: Every interview, every tweet seems to be a veiled jab at Apple while giving off ""fake Steve Jobs"" Vibes . It's great to have competition, but constantly comparing yourself to the biggest name is tiring. Focus on what makes Nothing unique and not on gimmicks.  * **Misleading Innovation Claims**: The transparent back with LED lights (Glyph Interface) is cool, but is it truly innovative? True Modular phones have been around for ages (think Motorola Moto Z) unlike the fake modular CMF phone (see the latest Jerry rig everything video). Phrases like ""breaking new ground"" feel exaggerated. Who can forget the fake and over the top reactions to the first Nothing phone. * **Sustainability vs. Charger Omission**: Preaching sustainability while not including a charger in a $200 phone and giving a removable back panel in CMF phone while glueing the battery is a bad look.   Now, let's look at the competition:  **Apple**: Whether you love them or hate them, Apple has a long history of groundbreaking tech (think the original iPhone and the M1 chip).  **Samsung**: Pioneering foldable displays is a huge accomplishment, pushing the boundaries of smartphone design.  **Xiaomi**: Their focus on powerful cameras and innovative designs like glass backs has made them a major player.  **Google**: Computational photography is a game-changer, and Google leads the way in this area.  So, what has Nothing brought to the table? Right now, it feels mostly like gimmicks. The modular phone claims haven't materialized and Carl Pie had the audacity to say that no one has been doing any innovation in smartphone space in last 10 years.  P.S. I'm open to having my mind changed! I If you think Nothing is bringing real innovation, share your thoughts below.",androidsever,1e6521t

"Fast charging is fucking amazing!! I just got the Pixel 7 Pro and this is the first ""new"" phone I've ever had. All my other phones have always been 3-5 year old hand me downs, I was finally in a position to be able to afford a nice one and damn I love it so much.   Whenever I see the words ""charging rapidly"" I get a huge burst of dopamine, and don't even get me started on the speed of the phone. Apps load so snappy quick, when I did a speedtest on 5g it was like 165mbps.   ... Then today I found out the pixel 9 pro will be coming out soon it's like damn at least let me have my moment for a second before you make me feel obsolete.   I guess I can't hate the player, I just hate the game.   Cheers! 👍  Edit: Congratulations to everybody who successfully one-upped me. I hope that dopamine you stole from me made you feel good.   Edit 2: Now I'm even more concerned, because I never even posted on how fast my phone charges (23W). All I said was the words ""charging rapidly"" gives me dopamine and I've had 10 people tell me how slow my phone charges. Is this a toxic community?   Edit 3: Here is my attempt to fit in with the cool kids. I don't have a monthly payment for this phone, other than my $25 for unlimited service throttled at 35gb, and 10gb hotspot. I paid $400 for the phone new out of the box. I am not stuck paying $90 for 36 months and overpay for the phone. That is my justification for not having 120 Watt charging like you guys.",androidsever,1e79f8e

"Are Pixel and OnePlus the only real alternatives to Samsung Galaxy? I've been in the Samsung Android ecosystem for some time, but I'm tired of Samsung Galaxy not having the ability to have more than one profile on a phone (though they're fine with doing that on their tablets?).  I want the ability to have a separate work and personal profile, but that's just not possible on any Samsung Galaxy phone.  I don't want to leave the Samsung ecosystem since I enjoy their products (and I have a Samsung watch and ear buds), but it really doesn't look like adding multiple profile options is something they're going to do.  But it seems that Samsung Galaxy seems to have the best camera for an Android phone, so I think I'm going to have to choose which one I want more. Having a good camera is also fairly important.  That being said, it really seems that my only options are either Pixel or OnePlus. Any thoughts? Especially from people who have used the latest models for Galaxy, Pixel, and OnePlus? Or other Android phones I may not have considered?  Thanks!",androidsever,1e01vdp

"Moved from Android to iOS - An underwhelming experience so far [A use case based assessment] I recently switched from an android (One Plus) to ios (iphone 15). While I was aware of several physical limitations like slow charging, 60Hz refresh rate and notch(dynamic island), I always believed that iphone's true magic was its usability. However, using it for few days has made me realize how underwhelming iOS is in terms of basic functionalities. This was definitely not what I expected from an enterprise that prides itself on being design centric. That's why I am writing this use case based assessment of iOS and iphone comparing it with similar functionalities in Android so that anyone thinking about making the switch can make an informed decision.  Usecase 1) - **Segregating Volume levels of app notifications and call ringtone -** I get maybe more than 50 notifications a day. While at work, having loud notification alerts becomes irritating. So, on android(One plus) I used to keep my notification volume low so that it doesn't become jarring to my colleagues. However, I still kept my call ringtone volume high so that I don't miss the 1-2 important calls that I get everyday on an average. To state the requirement explicitly, I want the notifications to be loud enough to be audible to me only (when I am with the phone) but I want the call ringtone to be loud enough to be audible from few metres away. ***This does not seem to be possible on iOS.*** I don't think this is something that is unique to me. Most folks get a lot of notifications on several apps but rarely get any calls. It seems absurd to group the volume levels of these two functionalities.  Here's a discussion about this on Apple support thread - [  Usecase 2) - **Standardized gestures to move back -** iOS implements gestures in an 'interesting' way. In most cases within an app, you can use gestures to go back to previous page/screen. However, when it comes to opening another app within an app(like opening webpage from an app), you would have to click on the button at the top left corner of the screen to go back to the previous app. This I feel is a downgrade from how it is handled in Android. On Android, you swipe right to back to previous screen/window irrespective of whether its within the same app or moving to another app.  Usecase 3) - **Selecting files/images -** Selecting multiple images/files is a very common activity on mobile phones. On my One Plus phone, I could simply long press any file to bring selection option wherein I can select multiple files. But on iphone, I have to go to the top of the screen to enable this option. This seems pretty unintuitive and requires extra effort on part of user to enable a functionality.  Usecase 4) - **Blocking spam message senders -** Most of us get probably dozens of spam/marketing messages on our mobile phones from Banks/Telecom providers etc. Blocking these senders should be effortless. On One Plus, I could use the same functionality that I had mentioned in last usecase i-e I could simple long press a message and a contextual menu used to pop up which had the option of adding the contact in to block list. On iOS, I have to open the message by clicking on it and then click on the sender icon, click on info and then click Block Caller to stop these spam messages. This seems like a lot of work.  Usecase 5) - **View images/documents on Files app -** Now, this isn't a design issue per se. The files app seems to be working perfectly fine for most folks. However, many people have reported that their Files app freezes especially if they are trying to open big files. For me the issue is with transferred pictures from my old phone. Whenever, I am trying to open the pictures on Files app, the app freezes without any warning. I don't think the files are corrupted as I can view the images fine on the Photos app.  Here's a discussion about this on Apple support page - [  It seems to be happening on ipads as well.  So, the general claim that Apple products just seem to work is untrue at least from what I have observed after using iOS for few days. Iphone 15 was my first apple product and its most likely is going to be my last as well. Its not that the iphone is very bad or unusable. It does the work for most part but then a mid range android also does that. I don't see why I should be paying a premium price for this experience.",androidsever,1cwyc52

"OnePlus unveils OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15, here are 10 of its new features OnePlus will roll out OxygenOS 15 ([based on Android 15]( to the OnePlus 12 next week, and here are 10 new features in the new release:    1) There's a [new split notification shade]( … but it is optional! OxygenOS 15 comes with a split notification and Quick Settings panels, but you’re given the choice to use the new Split UI or the Classic UI! I’ve grown fond of the split shade in recent weeks since it lets me see more of both, plus it’s easy to switch between the two.  2) More muted icon colors. Instead of having really colorful icons everywhere, OxygenOS 15 uses monochrome icons by default in the Quick Settings and [Settings home page]( that look less noisy. You can still change the system colors under Wallpapers & style, though!  3) Circle to Search, my beloved! [OxygenOS 15 brings Google’s Circle to Search feature]( to OnePlus phones, finally.  4) New animations throughout the OS, including for pulling down the notifications panel, charging your phone, launching an app, or unlocking via fingerprint. There are also now new fade-in/fade-out transition animations when going between the AOD to the lock screen to the home screen.  5) Open Canvas is available on phones now! This feature made it possible on the Open and Pad to multitask between 3 different apps in split-screen instead of only 2. On phones, Open Canvas makes it easier to switch between apps while multitasking.    6) You can now share files more easily with your iPhone friends. The new [Share with iPhone feature]( lets you transfer files to iPhone users without you needing to download an app, though your friends will have to download the O+ Connect app.  7) New AI photo features, like AI Unblur, AI Reflection Eraser, and AI Detail Boost. AI Unblur removes motion blur from photos (including old ones), [AI Reflection Eraser]( gets rid of reflections of glass/windows in photos, and [AI Detail Boost]( applies superresolution after you crop into a photo.  8) New AI features for note-taking and messaging. [AI Assistant for Notes]( can format, clean up (filler speech), polish (the copy of the content), continue writing (long text based on your inputs), elaborate (expand your points into usable paragraphs), shorten (takes long text and summarizes it).   AI Reply automatically analyzes on-screen content and generates replies in different tones in IM apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. In addition you can write your own texts and generate refined replies.  9) OnePlus OneTake lets you create beautiful personalized wallpapers of your pets. It’ll take a photo of a pet with a noisy background, cut out the pet from the photo, and put it into a neat visual frame.  10) Intelligent Search. This feature is coming to the next flagship (ie. OnePlus 13), and it’ll basically let you ask questions like “how much is my next phone bill?” and then it’ll perform a deep search of all your local files to extract that information and use AI to generate a response.  OnePlus also touted Theft Protection as an OxygenOS 15 feature during the briefing…but honestly it seems like it’s just the same Theft Protection feature that rolled out to all Android users recently? In any case, your OnePlus phone now has Android’s Theft Protection feature, so go turn ‘em on.",androidsever,1gb5959

"A note on the Google Tensor G5 A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).  [  This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.  Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;  2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.   2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.   2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.   2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\*  *Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*  [  Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;  [  There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;  1. **The manufacturing**  All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:  [  [  Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.  This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.  2. **The design**  If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.  Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).  An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.  [  Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.  However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).  The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).  (3) **The modem**  The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.  Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.  Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.  Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.  This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.  So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).  There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.  Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.  **Conclusion**  The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary.",androidsever,1dx9u3e

"Android 14 and 15 updates feel so underwhelming I was on Android 13. Upgraded to 14 and I could not help but think ""is this all?"". Upgraded to Android 15, and the update felt equally underwhelming.   I went looking for some new features introduced in both updates and here are the ones that stood out to me.  **Android 14**   * App pairs - Nice, but I doubt I'll use it much. * Pin auto-confirm - Nice feature, but considering modern unlocking methods, it's something I'll use rarely.  * Lock screen customisation - A nice change, but I don't really care much about custom lockscreen clock fonts. I like being able to set shortcut icons on the lockscreen though.   **Android 15**   * Private space - This is a good feature. Don't think I'll be using it much, but it's good to have.  * Volume and ringer adjustment look - The old one was fine too.  * Partial screen recordings - Good feature to have, but it's not something I'll be using every day.  * Back animation - I like this change, but I wish they had removed the back arrow for places where they use predictive back animations, it is unnecessary in those scenarios.  * BT Audio sharing - A decent feature, but you need to have the compatible hardware that supports it. * USB-C to monitor video streaming - A nice feature to have, but I'm not sure when I'll use it. But it's good to have.   Have I missed some important feature? The features I listed are good but they are nothing really ground breaking, it does not even have to be something big. For example, screen rotation button introduced in Android 9 was a relatively small feature, but it made a big difference for me, I turned off auto-rotate after its introduction.   Android 14 and 15 feel like underwhelming updates.   Then I started thinking what would actually make a difference for me, and I do have [my thoughts]( about it. I am interested what features would you still like to have introduced in Android 16 and higher?  One thing I am not happy about is that Android 14 and 15 broke compatibility with some of my old, but very useful apps like: SuperGenPass, Open Link With, Anything to PiP, AutoConvert, List My Apps. I wish there was a workaround for that. It seems like utility apps are not being developed much anymore and whatever is there is losing compatibility.   Also, you cannot have sticky notifications since Android 14. I use some apps (a network speed monitor and a todo list app) that utilise sticky notifications, it was convenient not be able to accidentally swipe them away.",androidsever,1gydzqa

Being able to select text in a text message is basic MVP functionality, and Google still hasn't implemented it.   Thank God for android and being able to switch messaging apps.

"unprocess - An Open Source Alternative to Zerocam Hello all!     As someone into photography, I decided to checkout Zerocam when it recently released on Android. I, like many of you, was [disappointed]( with the app's subscription and lack of ability to save as RAW. Therefore, I took it upon myself to make a freely available app with the same functionality as quickly as I could.      What does it do? Well, I sought out to offer the same functionality as Zerocam. Zerocam is a 1 page app that simply takes an unprocessed photo and saves it as a .jpg file. unprocess is able to do that, AND save as RAW! But that's basically it. The one big feature it is missing is a subscription, and I am going to keep it that way.      Word of warning, I had never written any code for Android before Monday of this week (about 4 days ago). The app is based off of a Google example app showing off the Camera2 API, and it looks very much like it. However, I have changed a good bit under the hood in order to get it to do what it needs to.      For anyone reading this that has Android/Kotlin experience, I would welcome any help you'd like to contribute. I have added 4 issues to GitHub that are the most glaring issues to be resolved, and you could probably knock those out in less than an hour if you know what you're doing.      [Here]( is the GitHub repo, the .apk can be found under the ""Releases"" tab. I may try to get it in the Play store if there is enough interest. I'll be in the comments for anyone who wants to ask or contribute anything!",androidsever,1gs9688

"I built an anime calendar app: MeronPan Hi Android enthusiasts! 👋   I’m an indie developer, and I wanted to share my latest project with you all: **MeronPan - Anime Calendar**, an app designed to help anime fans keep track of their favorite shows.  The idea came from my own frustration with remembering when new anime episodes air or where to watch them. I realized I needed a simple solution, and that’s how MeronPan was born!  # What does MeronPan do?  * **Intuitive calendar:** A minimalist, easy-to-use calendar that shows upcoming anime releases. * **Detailed info:** Includes airing schedules, and available streaming platforms. * **Constant updates:** The database is regularly updated to reflect the latest releases and platform changes.  I wanted to create something I’d use myself as an anime fan, and it’s been exciting to see how users are enjoying the app so far.  If you’d like to try it or check it out, you can find it here: [MeronPan on Google Play](  Any feedback or suggestions? I’m open to constructive criticism and new ideas! 😊",androidsever,1hnl0yo

Pixels give you an ability to [select text from recents]( You can also take a screenshot and the status bar icons will not be included in it, although the screenshots will be lower resolution than the normal one.   Text selection from the recents screen is such a killer feature that I wanted a Galaxy S24, but the lack of that feature stopped me from switching.   Auto song recognition is very useful. It is always on, hence you can trigger it very quickly. And its recognition database is on the phone too, so you don't need an Internet connection.   The call screening feature is great.

"Don't Let Reddit Kill 3rd Party Apps! ## [Link to original thread](  **I know this breaks a few rules but I feel like this is too important not to break them.**  *************  ## What's going on?  A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.  On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo]( to [Reddit is Fun]( to [Narwhal]( to [BaconReader](  Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.  This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.  ## What's the plan?  On June 12th, many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*.  ## What can you do?  1. **Complain.** Message the mods of r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: submit a [support request]( comment in relevant threads on r/reddit, such as [this one]( and sign your username in support to this post. 2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at r/ModCoord. 3. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible., and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.",androidsever,13zb7b5

"Difference in the smartphone culture in India and the US. Ok, so in the last few months where I have been browsing through this subreddit a lot, I have noticed some very clear differences in how people in my country (India) and people in US use/need features and, overall, their Android. I find these differences fascinating. English isn't my first language, so sorry for the mistakes. Also, I may be wrong in my assumptions, so feel free to correct me and explain :)    First off, preferred phone size. People here, and in China too I guess, love huge phones. 5.5"" is pretty common, with 6"" phones also selling very well, though some people like me prefer 5"". But anything smaller than that is considered 'tiny'. Whereas I have seen many westerners here constantly asking for 4.5"" phones, for ease of use. Do people in the US watch movies on their phones? Do they have smaller hands? Also, are smaller phones only a requirement of a few redditors, or is this a common thing among the Android users? Please note that I'm asking these questions out of pure curiosity.    Second, sms usage. I have seen this discussion quite a lot of times, especially along the lines of Allo-Whatsapp-iMessage. Sms is something we don't actively use for personal communication anymore. Its just there for notifications from banks, getting OTPs, and such. We use primarily Whatsapp and FB Messenger for communication here. Sms fallback (like iMesaage) is not something we want because sms is quite expensive here, and frankly, we just don't use sms much anymore. I think i understand this difference pretty well, but explanation about something I might have missed is welcome.    Third, budget tier smartphones. Maybe its just reddit, but I get the impression that flagship phones are the most popular ones in the US. India is a huge market for budget smartphones because, lets face it, India is indeed an economically backward country. But the budget section I'm talking about is the sub-15k (around $230), with phones like Redmi 3S, Redmi Note 3, Lenovo Vibe K5 and its Note version, Samsung Galaxy J3, J5, J7, and not about OP3T and similarly priced phones. 20k+ (around $310) are not considered budget here, they are considered expensive. As for the Pixel, I have yet to see a Pixel XL here. So it's not popular at all. How much is that section popular in western countries? I have heard a few things about BLU smartphones.    Fourth, dual sims. In India, dual sim is a must have feature for most people, students and professionals alike. I myself have two phones, both dual sims. So I have actually four numbers. This is fairly common. If a phone is not dual sim, it won't sell much. Whereas from some comments on Reddit I have seen in passing, I think dual sim is not really a common trend in the US. People still carry two phones with one sim each, one for professional and other for personal use. Why is it so? What are the contributing factors?  Edit : Since a lot of people are asking why I need four sims, let me clarify. I actually don't need 4,I'm keeping two extra just because I can and there is negligible maintenance cost involved. I (and most Indians) use prepaid. We 'reacharge' our numbers with, let's say, 100 rupees, and it gives me around 90 credits. Now I can use this credit to buy data, specific plans with limited validity, or I can just use it to call with the default call rates applying. Or I can just leave it be, and it'd remain there for months, sometimes years.  Also, I chose 100 rupees as an example. I can also use 10 rupees' recharge. 1$ is around 60-65 Indian rupees. So with 1$, I'm set for months, or even years.   Now why I and several other people here use two sims. Without any extra expenditure. And since data packs and calling packs are seperate, the bill actually gets lower. For example, Telenor's call rates are dirt cheap, but its data speed is bad. On the other hand, Airtel has good data speeds, but its call rate is way more than Telenor's. So many people use Telenor for calling and Airtel for data, getting the best of both without shelling out double the money.    Sorry for the wall of text :p   Tl;dr: lets discuss the differences in how Indians (easterners?) and Americans (westerners) use/need features in their smartphones.",androidsever,69pxao

"Android is the only thing stopping Samsung from achieving Apple like control Samsung make everything. Their hardware, pretty much *every* component Samsung can create. From memory chips, displays and CPUs, Samsung can make a phone without outsourcing anything. Even Apple can't do this - their components are made by other companies.  Not only that, but they've gotten good at it. The Exynos CPU series is competitive, they have a near monopoly over the OLED market because their screens are downright awesome. They can make a phone from the bottom up, without help (yes ik demand and stuff requires outsourcing, that's not the point).  The only thing they cannot do themselves is the software. They rely on Android and it's clear they don't like it as they seem to be distancing themselves from Google as much as possible. See: Android wear, GApps competition apps, Bixby. Samsung don't have a replacement for Android. Tizen is not made by Samsung and it's pretty bad, the security and ecosystem is crap. So until Samsung make their own mobile OS, they can't get total hardware and software control like Apple. They're very close though.  Thoughts?  EDIT: A few hours after writing this, TechAltar made a video which explains what I'm saying in a better way:

"So let's nip this f/1.6 marketing thing right in the bud while it's just starting This is mostly a marketing move, just like sensor size was with other phones like the N6P and Pixel. Neither of those parameters by themselves determine how much light the system gathers. f/1.6 doesn't do any good if the sensor size is smaller, which the V30's is.  No one in their right mind would state that the V30 with f/1.6 has lower noise than a DLSR at, say, f/2 or f/4, and that is obvious to most of us. But why exactly is that? f/number is determined by focal length divided by entrance pupil diameter. For example, to get a similar angle of view to the Pixel camera, a ""full frame"" DSLR would [need]( a 26mm lens. If you set the f/number to f/2, the entrance pupil will be 13mm. This is why the Pixel, with the same f/2 number, does not gather the same amount of light than that DSLR. In fact, the Pixel's entrance pupil is about 2.34mm only. Very small sensors require just very short focal lengths. Sometimes phone and compact camera manufacturers advertise a focal length that's ""equivalent"" to a standard ""full frame"" camera lens but the real focal length of the Pixel's lens, for instance, is only 4.67mm.  I can't think of a better real-world example than the Pixel and the S7. The former advertised a bigger sensor which was true, but can't beat the S7 in noise performance in raw images. The S7 advertised a ""wide"" f/1.7 aperture, but can't unambiguously beat the Pixel either. They both produce about the same amount of noise at equivalent exposure settings (targeting for same shutter speed), and this is because their entrance pupils are not that different in size (2.47mm for S7 vs. 2.34 mm for Pixel). The Pixel has a higher f/number, and the S7 has a smaller sensor, and both basically cancel out their advantages of sensor size and low f/number respectively. Now, if they Pixel had the same f/1.7 number, then the bigger sensor size would have actually mattered. Vice versa for the S7.  See the samples from RAW in [this article](  This is a big part of the reason the V30's camera doesn't impress. Another part is the camera app like others have pointed out. Google has the right idea, with these tiny camera systems you can only go so far. Much better gains are to be made by applying clever computational photography, and that's exactly what HDR+ is, and why the Pixel's (jpeg) results are so well regarded, cause the raws are nothing special compared to competition like the S7. Microsoft is also [investing]( on it. My Sony RX10M3 also has a noise reduction similar to HDR+ but not as sophisticated. This is where manufacturers should be investing most of their camera research IMO. It's the only feature that has actually yielded significant results in the real world. f/number (V30), sensor size (Pixel), and pixel size (HTC Ultra Pixel) as marketing bullet points, cannot claim that.  **EDIT:** see [this post]( for a bit of extra discussion.  **EDIT #2:** [Here]( is a video that goes in-depth about this topic thanks to /u/CreeDorofl for [linking it](  **EDIT #3:** /u/poodz asked a relevant question, which frankly I should have included here, but I didn't have the data at the time. What are the actual sizes of the sensors being mentioned?

"I really don’t understand the excuses manufacturers make for taking out the headphone jack Google said it was taken out to make way for a bezel less future. But wheres the proof of it? The Pixel 2 has the same ugly bezels that the pixel 1 had. The Pixel 2 XL has a somewhat better screen but it still doesn’t feel like a proper excuse to remove the jack as there are still huge bezels on BOTH sides. Should they should have kept the jack on the Pixel 2 and removed it from the XL?  Apple says its to ease waterproofing and they simply didn’t have enough space. Yet they only achieved IP67 instead of IP68. But a guy on youtube proved its somewhat possible.  Again what I want to point out is competition has proven all this wrong. I'm no Samsung fanboy but it can be clearly seen that Samsung has the finest design out there. MicroSD, IP68, Headphone Jack, and a great infinity screen. They even curved the screen at the sides! So isn’t whatever excuse google and apple make invalid? Cause Samsung has already proven them all wrong way back in 2017 March.   What I feel like is manufacturers are making lazy excuses to just cut off the headphone jack so they don’t have to spend much time in making it work. This is what I love about Samsung is they go all out, no compromises. Wireless charging to headphone jack they load their shit with everything they can find.",androidsever,74lcgw

"Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Display Issue - The scam that Samsung doesn't want to admit I know Samsung for the great phones and the software support they provide. All was well until the March Security update for Galaxy Note 9. Then, a lot of the devices displays started breaking. Displays overheated, and started turning green/yellowish green.   Obviously, a lot of users started complaining regarding this. After all, an issue due to a software update can be fixed by software, right? Apparently not, because sending the logs to their team through the internal bug reporting app led to no answers but generic ones like ""Reset your device"". Obviously, resetting the device did not work.  This is similar to the display issues plaguing the new Samsung phones like Galaxy S20, but which cannot be fixed by a software update.  Unfortunately, Samsung still does not admit the fault is due to the update, even though this problem is reported by hundreds of users across the world. While trying to find a fix for this problem (when I thought it could be fixed by a software update), I managed to find a telegram group: (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form  so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)  Looking through the messages, I found that Samsung asked the users to get their display replaced by paying for it which costs nearly 1/3rd of the price of the phone. Not to mention the Note 9 is a ""premium"" line of phones marketed by Samsung, and has not even completed 2 years from its launch. For a ""premium phone"", one would expect the device to last 2 years at the very least, even though the warranty covers 1 year. Not all of the users will buy the phone at launch, so most of the users are now out of warranty -- and the display is broken.   And Samsung is deliberately trying to suppress the issue (possibly to prevent bad publicity during the impending launch of their new phones). When I tweeted to them about the problems that I was facing, Samsung support asked me to DM. When I refused, because the problem needed to be public, they just spit out the link to find a nearest service centre. And then they deleted those tweets. I have had no response since.  2 days ago, when the phone became progressively unusable, I decided to submit the same to the Service Centre. I then get a call saying Samsung has released an internal guideline to all the Service Centres to fix the phones having the issue under warranty, but only if the body is free of any dents. When I asked the technicians to share the document, they refused saying that it's an internal document. This confirms that Samsung knows about the issue, but is deliberately denying users a fix in order to prevent bad publicity. Moreover, asking to fix only the phones without any dents disqualifies most phone owners. Samsung is basically telling the users -- ""We will fix the phones only if they are as good as new"" -- for a phone which customers have bought since 2 years ago.  More details are available in the telegram group:  (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form  so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)  One of the post is  which was also posted on Reddit at   You can see from the post that Samsung admins tried to delete the post 3 times before allowing it to be published.",androidsever,hsq8mp

"[TIPS] Getting the best out of Android I have compiled a set of tweaks that I have done over time to get the best out of my Android. This includes getting rid of ads, reducing bloatware, focusing on privacy, getting more performance and battery life. Most of this are focused on non-rooted phones, there are better alternatives if you are rooted.   Feel free to add your own tips below and I will add them here.   1. **Debloating:** Many OEMs will have a lot of apps preloaded like Facebook, Microsoft, Google apps, and their own apps. These can be removed through ADB. This is safe and can be reinstalled easily if needed.   Enable developer options by clicking the build number seven times and enable USB Debugging. Install ADB on your PC, connect your phone to PC and run **adb shell pm list packages** to list all your packages.    To remove a package run **adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 <package\_name>.** You can find a list of bloatware list for your device / OEM from xda-developers (Eg. [Note 10 bloatware list](   2. **Privacy:**     1. **App permissions:** App permissions are bundled under a single category now under Android-10. Permissions can be removed for apps that don't need them. Or better, removing permissions can be automated with [**Bouncer**](     2. More privacy options can be found in settings / app-settings through which you can turn off personalized ads.    3. **Disposable email-ids:** Temporary email addresses can be created with apps like [**Temp Mail**]( if an app or website forces you to login.    4. Use password managers and two factor authentications ([**Bitwarden**]( and [**andOTP**]( for secure logins.    5. Prefer open-source alternatives instead of apps that collect your personal data.    6. **Firewall:** I recommend [**Netguard**]( This blocks Internet access to apps that can function without internet (like Calculator, Camera, Gallery, Video / Music players). Netguard can also block ads and trackers (see below).   3. **Ad-blocking:** Before getting into this, I'd suggest buying a pro-version or supporting the developer directly whenever possible.    1. There are ad-blocking apps like [**Blokada**]( **/** [**DNS66**]( that uses VPN to block ads system-wide. There are many hosts file around internet that can block Ads, Trackers, etc.    2. If you are using [**Netguard**]( from above, there is a github version of it that supports ad-blocking as well ([    3. If you prefer to do this without VPN, devices above Android-9 supports Private DNS in settings. (Having [dns.adguard.com]( as your private DNS will block ads system-wide)   4. **Performance and battery:**    1. Frequently clearing an app from Recents menu will make it load again and consume more battery.    2. Automation apps like Bixby Routines / Tasker can be used to enhance battery life / performance, like       1. Turn off Mobile Data / Location when you're connected to Home Wifi network.       2. Turn off Data-Sync when phone is not charging.       3. Turn on Battery saver at night.       4. Turn on Locations only when you open an app that needs it (like Google maps, Uber, etc.)    3. Turning off background Wifi Scanning, Automatically download software updates can improve Battery life.    4. Turn off Digital Wellbeing by removing it from Usage Data Access, if you're not using it.    5. Don't use aggressive battery savers, they would cause more drain. Android's default Doze is good enough IMO.    6. Prefer Dark / Black themes especially when you have OLED displays.    7. Disable Fast charging whenever you can.    8. Keep your battery within 80% - 20% to prolong battery life.   5. **Other tips:**    1. Use [**Youtube Vanced**]( instead of default youtube app. This blocks all ads and allows Background playback, PiP mode and a cool AMOLED black theme.    2. [**Google Opinion Rewards**]( is a neat way to earn Google Play credits that can be used for play store purchases.    3. If you have a Samsung phone, check out GoodLock suite of apps. They are made by Samsung and offer crazy levels of customization. Also Hex installer is cool if you're into customization.    4. Reducing animation scale in Developer options will make your phone feel more responsive if you have older phones.    5. If you don't use Google assistant, disable Microphone access to google app and remove it from Device Assistant app from Settings->App->Default Apps.    6. Using [**Your phone**]( for Windows or [**KDE Connect**]( for Linux can make things seamless between Phone and PC.    7. If your phone has NFC, it can be used to automate lot of things by tapping on NFC tags like Turning on WiFi when you enter home, Unlock your PC by having a Tag near it, Having a bed time routine with a Tag on your bed, etc.  Check out [**NFC Tools**]( for more.     8. [**Hermit**]( can replace many apps like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon with their web versions.    9. [**Firefox Send**]( can be used to send files < 2GB to anyone through a link.    10. Replace chrome with [**Kiwi browser**]( or Firefox, they are open-source and support extensions.    11. Install and enable ADB on your PC and always allow debugging for your phone from your PC. This will come in handy when your display is broken, by controlling screen with scrcpy.    12. If you have a Snapdragon CPU, there will be a modded version of Google's camera for your phone. It would improve picture quality drastically with Google's HDR+ processing. You can check xda-developers.com for GCam for your device.    13. snapdrop.net can be used to share files to any device within your network. Just enter the URL in you browser and it'll work.   PS - Be careful when uninstalling system apps. Use a recommended debloat list for your device if you're not sure.  I will be adding more tips here. Suggestions are welcome.

"Now for Reddit has been reinstated on Google Play. Here's an update and a word of warning for other developers. Hey All  On Wednesday *Now for Reddit* was suspended and removed from Google Play. The reason [explained in a post]( submitted to r/Android was for violating the 'sexually explicit content' policy. I said I'd keep you updated when I heard more so I'm back with an update and some advice to help other developers avoid getting a similar policy strike :(  Firstly, many thanks to all of you who contacted me. A couple of Googlers who saw the post on r/Android helped bring this unfortunate situation to a brisk resolution.  #The Cause  A representative from Google Play informed me that a post made to r/documentaries was the reason for the suspension. This proves Google has a mechanism (be it manual or automated) to browse through screens when reviewing an app. This may not be a surprise but the post in question was tagged NSFW and so shouldn't have appeared in the app unless the NSFW filters were disabled in the app settings.  #The Solution  I've decided to block all NSFW posts unless you are logged in with your reddit account. This is what the official app does and it should help prevent future suspensions caused by NSFW posts.   **I'd advise developers of other apps to do the same if you do not already do this.**       All being well [Now for Reddit should be back in Google Play]( shortly.  Thanks again for all your messages of support. It's a great relief to be reinstated, losing something I've spent thousands of hours developing would have been a bitter pill to swallow to say the least!  Cheers",androidsever,5g3jxo

"[Idea] The new ""What song's playing?"" area on Pixel's always-on screen should be a permanent location for Google Now/Assistant notifications (mock-up inside) We're all familiar with the problem: Google Now cards are supposed to be there right when we need it, presenting us with relevant information without requiring any input from us, but Google never *really* pulled that off. It's still too cumbersome to reach them: you have to go to the Google app, ignore all those news articles you're not really interested in and click the ""Upcoming"" button... and you're never sure if you're gonna find anything in there anyways, it's mostly just the weather, and a traffic update even if you don't own a car or use public transport.  Then I saw the new feature of the Pixels where it inconspicuously displays what song is playing at the moment on the bottom of the always-on display. It's a cute touch, but it's too special a treatment for an ultimately niche feature. What if that area was not used just for song identification, but as a permanent notification area for whatever's the most pertinent/urgent Google Now/Assistant card is at the moment? Where you parked your car, if your flight is delayed, if your package is shipped... the usual stuff, but now it's not bothersome to reach, but not in your way either. Double tapping would take you directly to the ""Upcoming"" tab (or whatever). It could default to weather when there isn't any other urgent info, or it could just be black...   I think (something like) this could be a much more seamless experience than what we have now. [Here's an album of examples I quickly threw together]( What do you think?",androidsever,74oqc0

"Dear Google, please don't give flashlight apps my e-mail address in Android M **tl;dr** According to the limited information we have now, *all apps* written for Android M can have access to e-mail addresses of the owner.  ---  Now that we've seen the announcements from I/O, we've probably all heard of the migration to *[runtime permissions]( which allow you to be asked for permissions while using the app, as opposed to during installation (a good thing). What you also might've heard is that it now relies on permission [categories]( instead of the more specific permission model that was used in the past.  Alongside this change, apps will be [given more permissions by default]( even without accepting any permission categories on Android M. One of the permissions that currently [appears to be granted]( by default in Android M is GET_ACCOUNTS, which grants [access to your e-mail address]( for Google accounts, and even if Google changes this, might still grant access to e-mail addresses belonging to other account types and services. (Thanks to [christop]( for mentioning this permission.)  **My request to Google:** please don't grant this permission unless the user approves the Contacts category. Please ensure that merely installing the wrong flashlight app, live wallpaper or what-have-you cannot allow my e-mail address to be sent to an organization I've never heard of that is registered in the Seychelles. (Don't forget - full network access comes with all apps in Android M!)  ---  *Quit reading here if you're not interested in other issues and vulnerabilities the new model in Android M could cause.*  Aside from e-mail addresses, there are some other permissions I think might be troublesome to automatically grant to apps, and I'm not completely sure yet I've found all of them. I'd like to kindly ask anyone who can to thoroughly review those permissions to ensure that they don't end up as the technical debt that future API levels need to try to fix again, after causing users pain in the mean time.  * READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE isn't used much by the Nexus range, but for many other devices this permission is highly sensitive, containing full device backups, contact backups, and highly sensitive downloads outside of app-specific directories. It was not shown to be one of the new permission categories. How does Android M deal with it? Might it be time to switch away from FAT32 to ext4 to allow for permissions to apply to it?  * CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE is automatically granted and can allow apps to turn on mobile data (and WiFi). This can cost money to the millions of users who have exceeded their data plans or who are on prepaid plans. Suggested fix: a System Settings permission category.  * READ_PHONE_STATE is part of the Phone category, but used to be requested by developers frequently to detect *whether* there was an incoming call so that app audio could be muted. Please ensure that apps cannot get phone numbers without the Phone category, but that apps can still gracefully deal with incoming calls.  * GET_TASKS  is granted by default but was being deprecated. Please disable it in API23 so that apps cannot peek into the thumbnails of other apps. Information shown to the user may be sensitive and must not be seen by other apps.  * SET_WALLPAPER (and its hints) are granted by default and seem like low-impact permissions, but I'm sure that was initially thought of allowing apps to show notifications as well, until push ads came along. Now that the user can disable notifications for specific apps, apps may be inclined to show ads on the wallpaper instead if they're given this permission for free anyway (including ones prompting for virus scans and nonsense like that). I suggest adding this to a new System Settings permission category.  * WRITE_SETTINGS is granted by default, while it used to be treated as quite sensitive. A System Settings category would fix this.  * SET_TIME_ZONE is granted by default, but should also require System Settings.  * MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS is granted by default but allowed for redirecting audio streams, and should require the Microphone permission category. If this is now split off to MODIFY_AUDIO_ROUTING, consider making that a part of the System Settings category as well, instead of making this functionality impossible for future devices.  * READ_SYNC_SETTINGS, WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS could conceivably leak private details depending on the identity information associated with it. Might make more sense in a System Settings category.  * App names/icons displayed in the permission prompts should match the Play Store name and icon, otherwise apps may be inclined to request permissions as ""Android System"" or something equally serious.  * Contacts is a highly sensitive permission category, especially in conjunction with full network access. In some jurisdictions providing users' personal details such as phone numbers to third parties may even be illegal without the permissions of those contacts, and I think it's frowned upon by many regardless. There should be a way for apps to opt-out of all communication subsystems so that they can be allowed access to sensitive data such as contacts, special files, confidential recordings, etc. ""**Offline apps**"" if you will, which could be a simple label given automatically to all apps that do not request network permissions such as INTERNET, BLUETOOTH etc. This could be the only category whose auto-updates would need to be limited to updates that are also Offline apps. A lack of this feature will pose problems for devices used in high-security environments and could give Android a bad name in the enterprise environment, as nothing could ever be guaranteed to remain private.  If you have any thought on permissions that are inappropriate to grant automatically, please leave a comment. **Did I get something wrong? I'm sorry** - the available information is preliminary and still quite dispersed - again, please leave a comment.",androidsever,383rj8

"iPhone X, Pixel 2 XL, Note 8...a poor man's review I am not a rich man. I can't just go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers. There has to be research involved...I need to know what I'm buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period. So with 3 top-end phones in my crosshairs, the iPhone X, the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8, I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews, watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion: I have no idea what phone to buy, so why not try out all 3. Since I'm a man of limited means, I'd have to try them out one at a time. I started the upgrade process on my account, and set my sights on the first prize, the iPhone X.    X-tra screen, X-tra pricey...  The iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel I've ever held in my hands. The weight of the phone lets you know you've spent money on something well built. I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off, I was the center of attention...usually because I was. It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple. The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it, with its vivid, punchy colors and amazing brightness. The screen almost looks TOO good. Like you can reach in and touch the icons. The notch, while noticeable for about 3 minutes, just melts away. I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes. Even then, the notch didn't seem to upset me.  What did upset me was learning the gestures. Some of them make sense, swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance. But others, like getting to the background apps, felt slow and clunky. And getting to the control center should be easier than it is. It's not a one handed operation, but I really feel it should be! Sure, if you have big hands like I do, you can stretch your thumb out. But if you have small hands, it's not going to be easy. What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness. All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11. What has stayed simple though, is Apple's top notch bio metrics.  FaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendy's. I mean, Android has had this for years, right? Wrong, FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock. The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing. I liked that I didn't have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work, either. It just worked and that's what Apple people know and love. Animoji's...while an even bigger gimmick, were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of. Speaking of Cameras, both cameras did great, the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOS's live photos with 3D touch. It's about the only thing I used 3D touch for and it's done well. The video recording was very well done, with 4k @ 60FPS being its biggest highlight. The only thing I thought that wasn't well done was the OIS...to be honest, I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didn't feel like it. Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update. Overall though, the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer.   However, after using the phone for a little bit, I really felt cheated. I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years. I was not getting top of the line battery life from a $1100+ phone. And as an android user for the last 6 years, things just felt clunky navigating around the OS. I missed things I've taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs, AOD, and setting my own default apps. Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch. But, all in all, it just wasn't feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to me.  Let's go back to the Android basics, 2 XL style...  Being on AT&T, I couldn't just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL. That alone bugs me. I HATE carrier exclusive phones. Yes, I know, I can buy the phone direct from Google and that's good. But there's something nice about going to a carrier store, picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax (with a big bill later). Lucky for me, one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day. Holy bananas, this phone is snappy...no, snappy isn't good enough. It's, it's...Google needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels. I've been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life, with the One+one and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions. I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the ""I hate Samsung"" train that is r/Android was a bunch of nonsense. Even my S7Edge felt fine to me. No real slowdowns or anything. Nope... I was wrong. WAAAAAY wrong. The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari. My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying ""it's sooo smooth!""  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there, your phone is slow, you just don't realize it. The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own. I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life. Putting it against my other co-workers iPhone 8, she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life. I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself. My only complaint about the camera was I didn't have a lot of shooting mode options. Everything was very basic, with just a couple of modes. Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people, but I do like having options like a manual mode.  The Pixel 2's biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen. Once again, coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X, I think I'm a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays. I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XL's display. The blueshift on the phone I tested didn't stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs. I checked for light bleed and didn't see any. And while my friend's 2 XL is only a week old, I didn't see any burn in or image retention, but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods.  Speaking of brightness, this seems to be my only gripe with the screen. At max brightness, it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight. While I could see what was on screen, dark colors just merged together and details can't stand out. Out of the 3 phones I tested, this was by far the darkest screen. Its great for indoors, but I wasn't overly thrilled taking it outside.     Now, I fully admit I don't get the religious ""Pure Android"" or nothing attitude I see on Reddit. I think OEM skins aren't just nice, but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android. AOD, Multi-app display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG, Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android.  That being said, simple Android is pretty easy to use and I'd even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately. After tinkering with the 2 XL, I can definitely see the appeal, but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience.   A noteworthy experience, but can it last?  My final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. This phone is so big, I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house! I kid, but while expensive, the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money. And you really do, too! That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line. With it being able to do text translations and live messaging, it's a g̶i̶m̶m̶i̶c̶k̶ feature that I kept finding myself going back to. I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screen...that gorgeous, beautiful screen.   Picasso once said ""Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun."" Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display, but ""THE"" OLED display for others to copy. What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity (and it does), it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested. From app pairing, to cutting out sections of the screen, drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence, the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush. I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up. It's almost overwhelming! And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs. Android purists. Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power. THANKFULLY, I'm happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one. Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL, but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8. That's not to say there weren't the occasional frame drop here and there, now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience. I can hear what you're thinking, ""Smooth now, but give it a month or two..."" and I would agree with you. My Galaxy S6+ was probably the worst offender in recent memory. However, I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworker's Note 8 they've had since launch. Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same. I tried to break both phones, bogging them down with running apps, music and video. But to my surprise, both phones held steady.   What didn't hold steady was the battery life. I found it to be just barely ok. I think that with quick charge, we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life. Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM. I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster. We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why.   Camera wise, the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself. But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water. The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording. The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality! While the iPhone X's recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XL's was very tinny, the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction. This surprised me since I didn't think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speaker...it’s 2017 Samsung, stereo speakers are a thing! I’m sorry for yelling, Samsung...please don’t kill off the headphone jack.   Ok, Ok...TLDR, what did I pick? While beautiful, I couldn't get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out. The 2 XL can't be purchased/subsidized through AT&T's Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out. Which leaves me with the Note 8. I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CAN'T go wrong with any of them. The iPhone X is a beautiful...BEAUTIFUL work of art, the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone I've ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty.  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one!    EDIT: Thank you so much for the gold!  EDIT2: Fixed spelling errors and ""carrier skins"" to ""OEM skins""  thanks u/exelero88",androidsever,7ev6i4

"WARNING to all Wileyfox owners: your location data and WiFi information is being sold Recently, the nougat update rolled out for the device. Wileyfox added a feature called Yandex Zen, which is basically a newsfeed with ads. But when delving into the user agreement, dark things are going on. Specially because they sold themselves as privacy oriented, since it came with cyanogen installed.   - It collects location data and WiFi information, amongst other things.   - It sells this data to third parties.   - It cannot be uninstalled.   - Since the app is integrated, it bypasses android permissions.   All this combined, this means that they just take every user's digital data and sell it for profit. All of this without asking or warning about, nor the possibility to stop it.  Supposedly in the next update it will become uninstallable, but by then the advertisers will already have a good profile of every user.   For anyone interested, here is the user agreement:   Just wanted to give a heads up to all the  victims.",androidsever,696dre
"[Opinion] With the removal of the headphone jack in the next Pixel, Google NEEDS to add support for Bluetooth headset that send battery data I'm happy that they're beginning to improve Bluetooth at the system level with the O Betas, but this feature has been on iOS for a while and it can come handy, especially since most Bluetooth devices don't come with an in-built battery indicator or even an app of sorts. And since some OEMs like LG, Xiaomi, One plus, Huawei and even some custom ROMs have implemented it (even if it is half-baked) it should be somewhat easy for Google to do so at the AOSP level.   The official implementation is part of the Bluetooth spec, [it's called BAS]( but only Apple has officially implemented it. I'd LOVE for Google to get on it!   Here is a screenshot from an AOSP ROM of what I'm talking about:   EDIT: wording, added more OEMs to my little list lol. Also, remember the S8 was rumored to remove the jack but they kept it, so that keeps my hopes somewhat high",androidsever,6q9zfb

"The best way to publish your game on google play -make sure to show absolutely no gameplay in the Screenshots. If you have to, put half the already small gameplay picture behind a large concept art of a main character. And don't forget words like ""awesome story"" filling the other half. Do that for the rest of the screenshots.  A different option would be to put the title screen, main menu,skill menu and crafting menu and other menus in the screenshots. That'll make the game look better  -don't put a trailer showing gameplay. Just put a cinematic trailer finishing with the game's title on fire. You know what? Don't make a trailer at all  -always remember to put generic stuff in the description like""best game you'll ever play"",""one of the top 10 games in (put current year here) or ""the gameplay is very awesome"" -(game reviewer you've never heard of). And don't forget to ask for 5 stars now and then  -for the game icon you'll get more downloads if you put a screaming man or a ""heavily armored"" woman  -your game title should be in this format:  (Random name)+(name related to game): (more random names) +(a number bigger than 2. Do this even if this is your first version)  The "":"" part is important  This concludes my guide on how to get your game popular. And don't forget, **DO NOT SHOW ANY GAMEPLAY**",androidsever,7uaak4
"Hey /r/android! Oneplus broke camera2 api since the 7.0 update on OP3(T), rendering the phone unstable (as proved inside). Refuses to fix it, ignoring the all the complains. We need your help to show them how unacceptable this behavior is. Hey /r/android!      We all praise the efforts from OEMs to keep our phones with the latest software. We love the updates for the new functionalities, increased stability or even for the sake of having a higher number buried on ""about the phone"" section. However it all goes to waste when companies, in this case, oneplus, break and/or limit functionalities which were working good, with a new update iteration.      In this particular case, when the nougat update first started to roll out, people noted strange behaviors when using third party cameras (the ones that rely on camera2 API). Under some situations, the phones would hang for a long long time, crash, and display strange artifacts on the viewfinder. As it impacted heavily the phone camera usage, these issues were massively reported on oneplus forums, twitter and xda. (even by the creator of the known OpenCamera). Despite that, they got ignored, report after report, and still, to this day, almost a year later, there wasn't any official position on the issue         On the other hand, using the stock camera app won't reveal any issues. Why? Because it's using a modded legacy API (with HAL3 for the front camera according to sultanxda) to make it work. (The fact that an OEM is still using this method in 2017/18 would deserve its own discussion, but I will leave as it is, since it's not particularly relevant for this topic). But, as you may ask, if the stock camera works seamlessly, why do we need to rely on 3rd party ones?      Several reasons tbh:      - Useless panorama mode   - **Lack of more advanced controls like intervalometer, exposure metering mode**   - **Lack of manual video settings**   - Low quality 1080p time lapse mode   - No sound with slow motion   - (you tell me) /s      For those who might have interest on the topic, I'll shed this additional information.      - The camera will always crash during when pointed to bright scenes under some combinations of ISO and shutter speed.      - The exif data (ISO and shutter speed) is incorrectly reported on dark scenes      - Using full auto will allow higher than 799 ISO to be picked by the camera (despite the live stats of the app only read as 799). As soon as you force a manual control, the usable ISO range will be 100-799. Any higher than that and it is the same as 799.      These itself result on a partially useless camera2 API implementation which, if it wasn't enough already, make the phone unstable for every user. All it takes is a camera app download from the play store.         Detailed reports can be found [HERE (XDA)]( [HERE (ONEPLUS)]( and [HERE (oneplus)](         **Side note:** currently Google camera port is not 100% stable on our device for the same freaking reason, as it relies solely on camera API.      -         I don't like to free bash on companies, but this behavior is just unacceptable.    Can't just understand how can oneplus have a device unstable for a year without the intention to fix that. I'm really trying to bring attention to this as it is not a minor bug at all.      If this post leads to nowhere, at least I'm trying to inform people of the oneplus *modus operandi*. I still think their hardware is awesome (including my OP3T) but these decisions and the lacking support push me away from a future buy.   Never settle you say?         -            **TL;DR: Oneplus broke the camera2api since nougat update. Refuses to fix it, there are no official answers, despite it being reported countless times. All OP3(T) on nougat or oreo are not stable. Will face reboots and crashes under some usage patterns due to this problem**     **EDIT:**  Thanks for the support guys! I've uploaded two videos showing the bug to make our message more clear.  [Max/Reported ISO bug]( [Phone Crashing and turning unresponsive](   I believe that we, android users, should have to option to choose. It's even more valid if we consider that our phone was marketed for, not only obviously, enthusiasts.   That's why we fight to have the api working again. There are people who will find use in being able to shoot 500 30 secs 3200 ISO RAW photos 10 seconds to each other. Other will find the ability to shoot log video at a fixed 1/48 exposure @24p to post produce later on computer. Other will just download GCAM mod and find that actually we can get some flagship level shots from this phone. That's all about what an open and enthusiast phone should be. I simply refuse to accept the situation which looks like a half made job. It's even worse when your new product suffers from similar issues. Oneplus has the funds and dimension to correct address this problem. There's no way a phone with a 440€ price tag can be unstable when using any legit camera app, from the playstore itself, as long as it uses the HAL3.  **EDIT2:** There's a petition up and running that Agent 8923 linked @ comments section  [LINK](  **EDIT3:** Got a reddit PM from oneplus support. I know it does not mean much as lots of us reported the problem via submission forms and oneplus forums. I've told @oneplus via twitter about the problem 3 times only to be asked to use the bug submition form, which has resulted in nothing. I'm gathering all the info I can (logcats, dumps, crashing patterns, video proof, etc) to send them ASAP (and again lol). I will keep you updated later if it leads to somewhere",androidsever,7zpmy6

"Just stopped a fake Galaxy S6 craigslist deal that happened to be next to me. Be careful! (x-post from /r/GalaxyS6) Old lady drives down from Reno to a Starbucks in Sacramento (2 hour, 100 mile drive) I just happen to be sitting in at that time. She is there to purchase a $400 (MSRP $650) Galaxy S6. 30 minutes later (rudely late) a well built guy with a red striped brotank walks in, sits down with the lady. The S6 is uncharged because its ""new"". He makes small talk and plugs it in to charge. While it's charging, he tries to get the money from her right there and then (complaining about being in a rush), but thankfully, she doesn't give in and is adamant to see the S6 functioning.  I decide get up and walk by and notice the charger appears to be fake. To take a closer look, I ask if I can hold the ""S6"" so ""i can get to see what a white S6 looks like"" in comparison to my Black S6, look at the back, FCC tags are obviously fake (Thanks to the video below, I was able to recognize this S6 as a fake immediately). I say ""I need to order a drink"" to excuse myself from the seat, and ask starbucks staff if they can do anything about the scam about to take place, they can't. They tell me to ""Follow your heart"". (or some fucking bullshit, as they can't do anything store policy etc)  I decide to pull her aside and tell her its 100% fake, to walk away from this deal, and to not look back. She goes into the bathroom and locks herself in there (afraid that she might get followed if she got in her car) Scammer walks away looking fucking pissed and gives me a look as if he's gonna beat me into pieces. (This guy was not small)  Thank god for [this video]( I watched a few weeks ago  Edit: took pictures from behind       Regret not taking a video :/  TL;DR Watch this video before buying an S6 on craigslist.  www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4ovScUEGDM",androidsever,3655kz

"Shuttle Music Player is now open source! Hey /r/Android,  Over the years, I've given thought to the idea of open sourcing Shuttle. I enjoy open sourcing stuff - it's nice to be able to show off what you can do, help others, and also get some help in return. It's also nice to give back - without open source, Shuttle wouldn't exist.  For those who don't know it, Shuttle is a local music player for Android.   Check it out [Play Store]( or via the [website](  It started off in early 2012 as a project to learn how to code. With some really positive feedback and encouragement from /r/Android, and as my skills developed it slowly picked up momentum, and became a relatively successful app (at least in my books), reaching around 4 million downloads, and earning ~$AU150k in its 4 years of life.  I'm really proud of what I've been able to do with the app. It's led to a job as a full-time app developer, and I now develop both iOS and Android apps full-time.   It's worth noting though, that none of this was possible without open source, and help from the kind of people who love open source. When I was starting out, I discovered Apollo Music Player, and its developer, Andrew Neal. I sent him a bunch of emails asking how he managed to get around certain problems in the app. Although I considered the apps to be sort of in competition with one another, he couldn't have been more approachable and happy to help. Over emails, hangouts and eventually Slack, he ended up teaching me how to use Git, Eclipse (ugh), Java patterns, and tons more. Basically, he unwittingly and enthusiastically became a sort of mentor. It still surprises me to this day how someone can be so happy to take time out of their day just to show some random stranger on the internet how to do something. Yet, the same thing happens to me now, from time to time I'll get hit up on hangouts with someone asking how I solved a problem in Shuttle, and though it's not much effort for me, I always remember to pay it forward.  So, here's hoping that Shuttle can be to someone else, what Apollo was to me!  [Shuttle Music Player on Github](   ---  For developers:   Part of the motivation behind open sourcing Shuttle is also because I'd like to see the development move ahead a bit faster. In other words, I'm looking for **contributors**. So, if you're a beginner looking to get your hands dirty, or there's just that one feature that's lacking, and you think you know how to solve it, please feel free to give it a crack. Open an issue or make a pull request.  I don't have as much free time as I used to, and I also find that one of the downsides to working full-time as an app developer, is I'm less enthusiastic about writing code late into the night. Also, weirdly, the better I get at coding, the higher my standards are, and the *longer* it takes me to get things done.  I'm still actively developing Shuttle though, and I'll try to be as responsive as possible when discussing features, pull-request & bugs.  Shuttle uses a few modern technologies & libraries, including RXJava, Retrofit and Glide - and I think there's plenty to discover there for all kinds of developers.  However, I'm no expert. So, if you see some crazy piece of code that makes your eyes bleed, make a PR or let me know!   For Shuttle users:  Hopefully Shuttle will become a bit more active, and you'll start seeing some more features sooner.  I'm also using a public issue tracker now ( so it should become a little easier to track the progress of feature requests and bug fixes.   ---  I'm really excited about this new chapter for Shuttle, but it's quite nerve-racking as well.. Shuttle development has been a dictatorship for the last 4 years, where I've had the final say on everything. I'm now stepping back a little bit to allow others to contribute, so that will take some adjustment.  The other scary thing is putting all this code out there for everyone to see. I imagine this is how Cersei felt being marched naked to the Red Keep. I can imagine some developers digging around in the code and ringing a bell, crying 'shame, shame'. There are a few shameful bits of code, but there's some gold in these hills as well.   Anyway, I'm probably gonna fall asleep pretty soon, but I'll be back in a few hours to answer questions, so AMA away.  Edit: I have to sleep now, it's 3am in Aus. I'll be back to answer more questions in a little while.   Edit 2: OK, I'm back!",androidsever,5w4b7a

"PSA: On Android 8.1 as it is now, forgetting your screen lock PIN/Pattern/password will permanently brick your device. Here's the story of how this happened, if anyone's interested.   I upgraded through the beta program to 8.1 so I could use VoLTE and HD voice on AT&T with my Pixel 2 XL, which worked. Due to another really boring story, I forgot my new unlock pattern. I couldn't get in via Android Device Manager, because it no longer removes your current lock, so I factory data reset my device, thinking that Factory Reset Protection would ask for my google password and all would be well.  Well, as of 8.1, it doesn't any longer. Now, instead, Factory Reset Protection asks you for you ""previously used secret"" and gives no option to change the input from pattern (in my case) to anything else. Google technical support confirmed this by requesting I factory reset again, and then replacing my device via RMA.  I also tried flashing 8.0 factory images, and even downgrading my device doesn't work. I get an error from fastboot that is virtually ungoogleable. It says [FAILED \(remote: check device console\)](  I'm not looking for help in any way, I just wanted to warn everyone on the beta, and that this may be a sign of things to come in the future of Android.",androidsever,7a0l7y

"Dear developers, my notification bar is NOT a billboard. Every so often I'll get a notification from some apps that weren't created by my or someone else's action. Rather, they consist of either ""hey, you haven't done <x> in awhile, come back!"" our even worse, a straight up product ad.  The notification drawer isn't a canvas for you to spew your marketing bullshit at me. If something appears there, it should be because I've elected to be notified of something. Stop making that decision for me. All it gets you is your app uninstalled  EDIT: Since this blew up, I'd like to address a couple points people have been making:  * Words With Friends is apparently a bad example, since they have a paid version which removes the ads. It's nice that I have that option, and if I played the game more frequently I likely would pony up for it (although, ironically, playing more would also remove their ""you don't play enough"" ad). But there are many apps that DON'T have paid alternatives and don't give you an option to block unsolicited notifications.  * Blocking notifications from an app is an option, but it needs more fine-grained control. I don't want to blanket block every notification. In the WWF example, I still want to know when it's my turn in a currently active game, but I DON'T want a prompt saying I should start a new one. I'd love to see an update to the notification API that made developers register each possible notification their app will push with the system, then at a system level let the user decide which ones can and can't appear.   * Uninstalling the app is what usually ends up happening, but for some apps, the pros of having the app outweigh this con, so it becomes harder to send the message. So I don't see it as a good solution in general.   Again these are just my thoughts, although I'm glad to see people tend to agree with me on it.",androidsever,24x1s6

"How I learned to develop Android apps in a little over a month A month and two weeks ago, I knew nothing about Java. I knew some C from an intro class I took Freshman year of college. Today I released my first Android app. These are the steps I took. - - - #Starting out  I started because I found myself with a good amount of free time, and wanted to do something constructive (3000+ hours of League of Legends was just too much). I looked up app development as I've always been interested, and was inspired by [this post.]( Does it really take a year? I decided to try and find out.  First step was learning Java. I went through and did every exercise from [this website]( although I did skip the GUI/Graphics stuff because Android Studio would hopefully take care of it. This took me about 3-4 days. At the end of it, I had a pretty solid understanding of what Java is and fundamentally how to use it.  - - - #Learning Android Studio  So with Java under my belt (EDIT: okay not really but enough to start), I downloaded Android Studio from [here]( and went straight to the Training course offered directly from Google ([here](   At first, Android Studio was a nightmare. I had **no idea** what was going on. I spent a day trying to get the basic ""Hello World"" program to run, despite the code already being done (Google puts it in there at the start of a new project). Once I was able to do that, I simply tried adding things to it... a random text box, some buttons. This part was somewhat familiar, as it was similar to using the drawing tools in Microsoft Word (dragging and dropping shapes).   Once I had a inkling of how the user interface builder worked, I went further into Google's training program, learning how to start a new ""Activity"" (a new window in your app.. sorta) by pressing a button.   I found a few more similar tutorials on the web, and followed them just to learn how Android Studio works. All in all this took me about a week and a half.  - - - #Starting my first app  Someone once told me the golden rule to learning programming is simply to pick a random project and do it. So that's what I did. As a first project, picking a utility app (like a calculator, stopwatch, etc.) is easiest.  My idea was theoretically simple: make an app that will tell you which of your friends is the best at texting. I decided to make a list of project ""implementation steps"" and cross them out as I finished them. You can see my list [here.]( - - - #Programming my app  The next month, up to today, was spent building my app. The idea turned out to be much more complicated than I had thought, but I stuck to my plan. Most of my learning came from googling how to do something, finding a similar example, and trying to tweak it to fit my project. I became quite adept at googling.  I won't go into the details here, but the important thing is I now **know enough to build a complete app.**  - - - Through this experience, I found a new passion for programming. Hopefully someone else reading this can too.  If you'd like to check out what I made, [my app is on the play store.](    **TL;DR** I went from nothing to making my first app in a little over a month, mostly by making a plan and sticking to it.",androidsever,3l0myr

"This goes to show some of the most horrendous problems we have in Android right now [Screenshot Imgur Link](  Background: So basically the user is complaining in a review about an app having ads, the thing is this app (FX File Explorer) does not have any ads even in [free version]( let alone the [paid version]( (As listed in Play Store listing as well as mentioned by the developer)  Issues:  1. The terrible situation with Adware/Bloated apps that shows ads all over the phone (even in/over other apps) completely ruining the experience and Google lists them as Top Free Apps. This deserves a facepalm. (This apps mainly uses ""Draw over other apps"" permission)  2. The permissions asked by these apps.  3. The terrible state of Reviews in Google Play Store. Fake reviews, Bots etc. (Also been discussed in this threads [a month ago]( and [a year ago](  4. No option for users to see Upvoted/Downvoted reviews or comment on them. (Like reviews in Amazon reviews for example or even Reddit itself for what it's worth)  5. People leaving 1-star reviews without even explaining/writing why. (Seriously, why is this even allowed)  Lastly, this was inspired by [another thread]( by /u/defectiveawesomdude (Thanks!) [Here's another Screenshot provided by him.](   Please write what do you think are the other issues.  **Edit**: *Guys, this post isn't specifically about FX File Explorer or anything, neither am I affiliated with them in any way.

"Leading Android scientific calculator now requires Caller ID **Disclaimer**: I’m developing a competing application, [Natural Scientific Calculator]( so I ~~might be a little~~ am biased. Nonetheless, all the following is factually correct and referenced for your convenience.  Recently I was scoping out our competition and stumbled upon an app named “[Scientific Calculator]( by Sappalodapps. I found out that they had added a new feature: Caller ID. I thought to myself, “why in the world would a scientific calculator provide Caller ID?”  So I looked at the permissions that they requested: They need access to your entire contacts book, they need to know your precise location using GPS, they need to be able to read all your call history and they need to read your entire storage. I know for a fact that none of these are necessary for a calculator app. [\[1\]](  So why would they request so many permissions?  After some thought, it was clearly to generate more revenue which the developers themselves confirmed: “...it helps us fund further development of the app. If you don't like the feature you can always turn it off in the settings.” [[2]](   If they were struggling for revenue, why wouldn’t they simply add advertising to the app? With the millions of users that they had, advertising should definitely have provided a liveable wage. After some snooping around it turns out that the developers were both greedy and misleading. They didn’t opt for ordinary and non-intrusive advertising because the revenue they stood to gain paled in comparison to the Caller ID system that they chose to implement. [\[3\]]( Furthermore, they flat out lied when they claim in their description that their app is “Advertisement free!” [\[4\]](   This is what happens when you get a call with this app installed (I’ve blurred out the name and phone number):  [Screenshot](  When the call ends, it serves up some advertising (so much for “no ads”):  [Screenshot](  Believe it or not **it gets EVEN worse.**   I decided to take a look at the legal disclaimer and this is what I found out. The Caller ID service is provided by a company that’s unfortunately but aptly named CIAmedia (not affiliated with the Central Intelligence Agency). I say aptly named, since they literally track who you call and harvest the entirety of your phone’s data, whether it be your location, or call logs to show you targeted ads!   They even boast about it on their website:   “CIAmedia's unique ad targeting technology knows which businesses, phone numbers or even local contacts a user is calling. We mix this valuable info with other targeting criteria like gender, age and location.” [\[5\]]( )   As a developer and a devoted user of Android this really disgusts me. The reason why I decided to develop Natural Scientific Calculator was because of the horrible state of calculator apps on Android. All of them had clunky one line displays, outdated Gingerbread-esque design and required users to navigate using buttons rather than touch. And to top it off, now one of the leading scientific calculator apps on the store is trying to mine our personal details to increase their revenue.  I have a tip - maybe instead of trying to squeeze every last bit of personal information from your users to generate ad revenue, make a better scientific calculator that users will actually pay for.   Now looking back, it seems like the phenomena of flashlight apps and their ridiculous requests for permissions were a sign of things to come. It’s clearly evident that the practice of requesting permissions to harvest user data is becoming increasingly widespread on the Android platform. ________________________________________________  **TL;DR**: Leading scientific calculator app adds Caller ID feature to mine call history and GPS location to serve lucrative ads to users.   _____________________________________________________________  **EDIT 1**: Extremely shameless plug but the scientific calculator I'm developing is very different from the rest on the store, since it allows you to touch to navigate and write equations as you would on paper. And it definitely does NOT request ridiculous permissions. We really need some help getting discovered. If you're looking for one you know where to go :P   [**Play Store Link**](  **EDIT 2**: Okay, another major problem of Android is this. You know what **allows** apps to pull stuff like this? The lack of movement in the search results of the Play Store. Compared to the App Store, the volatility of rankings is virtually non-existent. That's why you end with the problem of apps misusing their position at the top of the search results - either by not updating their design/functionality (e.g. RealCalc) or by adding Caller ID to milk their users dry (e.g. Scientific Calculator by Sappalodapps). They can do this because their rankings don't get affected! They were there 3 or 4 years ago and they'll stay at the top of the search results, simply by virtue of getting there early, rather than being the best.",androidsever,45xgpo

I cloned the clock from the left side of the notch and moved it to the right, then shifted the airplane and battery icon down. I did not resize the icons. As you can see, there's enough room there to comfortably fit 2 lines of notification.   [Here's the mockup](  Obviously everyone will have their own preferences. But, I like having my static icons (clock, battery, signal, BT, wifi) on the right and app notifications on the left. That way, at a glance I'll know if I have a pending notification.

This is the image that I used, which contains 2 blurred moons:   I replicated my original setup, shot the monitor from across the room, and got this:   As you can see, one moon got the ""AI enhancement"", while the other one shows what was actually visible to the sensor - a blurry mess  I think this settles it.  EDIT: I've added this info to my original post, but am fully aware that people won't read the edits to a post they have already read, so I am posting it as a standalone post  EDIT2: **Latest update, as per request:**  1) Image of the blurred moon with a superimposed gray square on it, and an identical gray square outside of it -   2) S23 Ultra capture of said image -   3) Comparison of the gray patch on the moon with the gray patch in space -   As it is evident, the gray patch in space looks normal, no texture has been applied. The gray patch on the moon has been filled in with moon-like details.  It's literally adding in detail that weren't there. It's not deconvolution, it's not sharpening, it's not super resolution, it's not ""multiple frames or exposures"". It's generating data.",androidsever,11p7rqy

You can find what redirect URI you need by [looking through the readme on the patches on Github]( (under the corresponding app in the Details section). * Copy the client ID string that appears in the app you just made, create a text document named `reddit_client_id_revanced.txt` and put it on the root of your phone's storage (`/storage/emulated/0/<file here>`) with that key in it. * Install the [newest version of ReVanced Manager]( on your device, tap the Patcher tab, tap your app.  * **Once again, make sure you're using the newest version of ReVanced Manager.** * In the Patches section, tick the ""Change Oauth Client Id"" patch. * Patch and install (note that if you're using an app that's already installed, you might have to delete it *before* clicking Install once Revanced is done creating the new apk.) * Should be good to go from there.

"I created a tool to help Android Developers launch faster. Hello, Developers!  I want to show you my latest project and I'd really like to hear what you think about it.  After many years of working on Android apps, I found out that to bring any of my great (or so I believed) app ideas to life, I repeatedly had to write the same code from scratch.  The whole process of authentication, push notifications, premium subscriptions... even small things like the onboarding screen. It really bothered me that before I could work on the main features of my app, I had to spend days dealing with the boring setup process.  That's why I made [AppKickOff]( an Android boilerplate code that can help you launch your amazing app ideas in days, not weeks.  You can set up your next Android Studio Project in less than a minute with the following components generated instantly:   📦 DatabaseKit   🔒 AuthKit   💳 InAppPurchaseKit   📊 AnalyticsKit   🔔 NotificationKit   🖌️ DesignKit  You can find more information about these components on our website!

"Recomendations for a Password Protected Android Email App? Due to the type of work I realize in the office, sometimes I leave my cell phone unlocked while I focus in another activity. I'm looking for an Android Email app that let me set a good password and ask for it everytime I open the app. Until now I've only found four. AquaMail is a good app but it seems not to be 100% compatible with my email provider, also it come with Ads. FairEmail in it's Pro Version enables that posibility but it's a new app and I have concerns about its reliability. BlueMail is the actual app that I'm using, but it just only let me set a 4 digits numeric PIN, and there is no cooldown between failed attempts. Finally, ProtonMail is only usable with it's own accounts and doesn't let me add another email providers accounts. I really don't want to try to use AppLocker or similar apps.",androidsever,14lozzc

"Why You Need an MDM Solution For Android Digital Signage Modern businesses are evolving, thanks to the arrival of accessible technology. Today, conventionally non-tech enterprises including retail and agriculture are making use of technology to streamline processes, improve customer service and accelerate the productivity of the workforce. In this article, we will have a look at Android-based digital signage for business and how this modern tech can help transform businesses when coupled with an MDM solution.  ## Android Digital Signage  Android devices are known for being user-friendly and cost-effective and hence find a popular place for personal as well as enterprise use. Android digital signage kiosks are used at various places, in retail malls, at the airports, at hotels, resorts, at the hospitals, in school, in museums, Android-based digital signage is widely used in industries like retail, hospitality, education, healthcare, travel & tourism. They are used for displaying advertisements, maps, traveling information like interactive videos, the map of a museum or shopping mall, flight status, information about a historical landmark.  Android digital signage is used very conveniently for various purposes as people get interested in displays that are eye-catching and dynamic and offer a great deal of flexibility.  However, the bottom line is that while digital signage offers a great deal of flexibility and capabilities, the way you remotely manage will determine how effective it will become, as there will be a number of signages deployed at various locations. The IT admins/business owners managing a fleet of Android-based digital signage have to consider the following challenges:  What if something goes wrong with Android devices that are used as signage?  What if the app running on all the signage needs an update?  What if some additional content is to be urgently uploaded on the signage at a remote location or there is some change in the existing content and updated one needs to be shared?  What if you need to install the digital signage solutions’ app remotely on the number of signage at various locations?  ## Scalefusion MDM for Android digital signage  Scalefusion is an [Android Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution]( for digital signage, enables retail malls, hotels & resorts, schools, and other services as well to have content management on devices while offering extensive remote management capabilities to centrally control and manage all the signage across multiple locations.  Read more: Lock Android Tablet into Digital Signage using Scalefusion MDM  ## Over the air provisioning  With Scalefusion support for Android zero-touch, businesses can configure their Android digital signage devices such as tablets, Android screens and Android TV boxes over the air and directly ship a provisioned device to the end location.  Also read: Android TV Kiosk Mode: Turn Your Android TV into Digital Signage  ## Kiosk lockdown mode  Using the Scalefusion [Kiosk lockdown mode]( any Android tablet/TV can be turned into digital signage. The applications other than the app to be displayed are blocked and the device serves as a display screen. Admins can also control the screen orientation, brightness and hardware keys.  ## Remote Content Management  With Scalefusion content management for Android digital signage, IT teams can push content files, folders, videos and presentations on the digital signage remotely. They can switch between two presentations, update or change the content remotely.  ## Remote location tracking & security alerts  Scalefusion offers location tracking for Android digital signage and IT admins can also set geofences to ensure that if the digital signage is moved from its location, the IT is alerted. IT admins can also configure security alerts if end-users try to factory reset the device or attempt several wrong passcodes. This can help in ensuring device security.  ## Reports & Workflows  IT teams managing Android digital signage can automate security alerts, compliance checks with workflows and obtain detailed reports of the device activity and performance. IT can schedule downtimes, reboots and this comes in handy since Android digital signages are mostly unattended. The IT teams can keep track of data usage, battery usage of the Android-based digital devices and keep a close eye on the entire inventory remotely.  ## Remote Support  The Android digital signage devices are unattended and if a device is down, the IT teams have no option but to physically examine the device. But with Scalefusion Remote cast and control, IT teams can not only remotely mirror the device screens but can also take control of the screen, navigate folders, push or delete files and record the device behavior for further support escalation  ## Web-based dashboard  Scalefusion MDM enables businesses to simplify their Android digital signage management from a web-based dashboard that can be accessed on any computer. This gives the IT teams the flexibility to manage and control all the digital signage at a different location from a single dashboard. Create robust security configurations and control access, schedule remote app updates on rooted devices and get health stats of all the signage.  ## Business benefits of MDM for Android digital signage  * **Enhanced inventory management** * **Easy content updates for better customer engagement** * **Improved device security** * **Reduced costs for deploying and troubleshooting remotely operating devices**  Scalefusion Mobile Device Management for digital signage provides you with all the capabilities you need for the remote central management of the deployed digital signage.",androidsever,169tsfn

"Decade long iOS user trying to switch to android Hey everyone, So, I recently got an iPhone 16 for work, and honestly, I'm finding myself pretty disappointed. Especially the lack of those promised Apple Intelligence features here in the EU right now feels like a real miss, and the phones themselves seem (once again) repetitive. It's got me seriously thinking about finally switching to Android (currently using the iPhone14 as a personal phone). I'm not super deep in the Apple ecosystem thankfully – I use Linux on my home PC so I already rely on Google Photos and other Google services. Plus, I checked, and Apple Music is available on Android, so that's no issue! But diving into Android feels huge, and I'm not sure where to start. I'd love some recommendations for manufacturers or specific phones that would make the switch as smooth as possible. Here's what's important to me in a new phone:  - Clean Design & OS: I really like a phone that looks and feels clean, both physically and in the software (not too much pre-installed junk!).  - Decent Camera: I'm not a photography expert, but I want photos that look good for everyday moments.  -Decent Battery Life: Need something that can comfortably get me through the day without constantly looking for a charger.  -Google Integration: Since I already use a lot of Google services, good integration is a big plus.  -AI Features: I've seen some cool AI stuff on Android, like photo editing magic and writing assistants, and I'd love to have access to things like that.  -Long-term Stability: I want a phone that will be reliable and supported with software updates for several years.  -Ecosystem Integration: Ideally, it would integrate nicely with a watch and headphones from the same or a closely compatible ecosystem.  -Easy Transition: Anything that helps make the move from iOS less painful is a bonus! Beyond the phone itself, I have a couple of questions as an iPhone switcher:  -Messaging (iMessage): A few people I talk to regularly use iMessage. I tried to get RCS working on my iPhone (to test it out) without luck. Is there a good Android alternative (WhatsApp I assume?) or solution for talking to iMessage users, maybe using RCS effectively?  -Payments (Apple Pay): I rely on Apple Pay quite a bit. Is Google Pay a solid equivalent, or are there other contactless payment options on Android that work just as smoothly for purchases?  Any advice or suggestions you could offer would be amazing! Thank you in advance for your help!",androidsever,1kpg52n
"Google Go suddenly won't let me download images anymore... This BS only just started a few days ago...   Whenever I try to download an image I see in the search results (the images section), I would get this response:   *""To download images, allow access to photos on your device""*  I already tried everything I could think of. Granting all permissions related to the app, updating the app (it was already up yo date) deleting all of the app's data, even resetting the app to its factory version. But the problem still persists.  And given how chrome doesn't allow saving Google search images, and the regular Google app is impossible to install on my phone, if I don't get this taken care of, then I may never be able to save any Google search image again, unless I get a new phone. And that's a big problem, given how lots of what I do revolves around saving web images for reference.   If anyone else is familiar with this bug/issue, please help me out...

But this final one i've settled on as the most possible - waypoint-free  - still won't install.  all I want is something that records location when I press the button. no bells and whistles necessary.   can anyone help?  to install waypoint-free or a similar?  ad free?  i was using a good thing - gps waypoints but they've gone  mad.  you cannot record a waypoint without hassling with one of their ad q & a's.,androidsever,1kpc1zq

"Migrate most apps to new phone NOW, but migrate WhatsApp LATER I know a lot of questions are asked about WhatsApp on here, but I haven't found one that covers this scenario.  I got myself a new android phone and plan to set it up to work alongside my old android phone for a while, before I eventually start using the new phone exclusively.  I know how to restore the old app data onto the new phone at first setup using Google's servers. This is fine for most of my apps, but WhatsApp is a little bit different in that it can only be used on one primary device at a time, so I'm hoping to transfer it to the new phone last of all.  This is where I run into a bit of confusion, because Google doesn't allow you to restore app data selectively, nor does it allow you to restore app data after the initial setup.  Here are my thoughts...  * I **do** need WhatsApp to continue to work on the **old phone** until I start using the new phone exclusively. * I **don't** need WhatsApp to work on the **new phone** at all until I start using the new phone exclusively. * I looked into WhatsApp's *'linked device'* feature, but this seems to be a dead end as you can't convert a *'linked device'* to be the *'primary device'* or convert the *'primary device'* to be a *'linked device'*. * I assume that letting Google's servers restore the WhatsApp app data during the initial setup of the new phone will force the new phone to become the primary WhatsApp device, or can I avoid that happening by simply not opening WhatsApp on the new phone? 🤔 * I may use both phones alongside each other for a while before I eventually start using the new phone exclusively. During that time the primary WhatsApp device (the old phone) will send & receive more WhatsApp messages. I will need those additional WhatsApp messages to be present on the new phone after I make it the new primary device. * If I can somehow avoid the initial setup of the new phone from making it the primary WhatsApp device immediately, then I could possibly do the following sequence...     1. Use Google servers to restore all of the app data (including WhatsApp) to the new phone during the phone's initial setup.     2. Clear the app data for WhatsApp on the new phone.     3. Wait until I'm ready to start using the new phone exclusively.     4. Open WhatsApp on the new phone and login, which will make the new phone the primary WhatsApp device.     5. Restore the chat and media history to the new phone using WhatsApp's own backup on Google Drive or WhatsApp's *'Transfer chats'* feature.  Do you have any thoughts / advice?",androidsever,1kox2ua

Does the Samsung Galaxy a16 support USB-c to HDMI for mirroring? I  bought a USB-c to HDMI cable thinking my phone would mirror on a larger monitor. My phone isn't capable. I am looking for a cheapish phone with USB-c to HDMI mirroring capabilities but can't find any supporting evidence that the a16 will work. Google's AI generated texts say it is USB-c  3.0 and it supports HDMI output but I can't find any sort of YouTube video or reddit thread or tech forum around it. When I tried to find one for the a16 specifically it always shows like the s series or a14/15 or it'll be a generic how to video that never specified the exact phone they used.  Does anybody know if the Galaxy a16 will mirror on a tv/monitor using a USB-c to HDMI cable?  To clarify: It's not a USB-c adapter with HDMI ports. It is just a cable with a USB-c plug on one side and an HDMI plug on the other..... If that even matters.,androidsever,1kp81vb

"Advice on fingerprint reader issues! On screen fingerprint readers don't work for me, so I am looking for a solution, please help!   I have an S22 Ultra  Can I: 1) Add an external, capacitance fingerprint reader to my phone?  2) Use my old phone (OnePlus 6) as an interface for my new phone?  3) Use an android watch to access things like banking and password protectors on the S22 U?   Is there another solution not mentioned above?   My story The fingerprint reader on my S22 Ultra is so useless that it barely works even without a screen protector, and with one, just forget it. I look after my phones, so have it in a chunky Otterbox defender case, but no screen protector means my screen has smashed. I have never broken a phone screen in nearly 30 years of mobile phone ownership, but this one I have broken twice!  However, my old Oneplus 6 has an excellent fingerprint reader - so good that, while my other phone is being mended, I am really enjoying using this ancient Oneplus 6 because it is just easy to use without passwords and swipe codes.   I love the software in the S22 Ultra, but I would prefer to use my Oneplus 6 as my normal interface, and keep the Samsung safe.   If I could get an external capacitance fingerprint reader for the S22 Ultra, that would probably also work, but they don't seem to exist. Also, the S22 U weighs a tonne, whereas my Oneplus 6 is easy to hold, fits in a pocket, and I can take photos with 1 hand. I miss the S22 cameras, but if I make a phone call, the Oneplus is much easier to hold than the Samsung.   So yes, I have a use case. My all singing and dancing Samsung is still not as good at certain seriously key things as my much older phone. And even worse, I understand that Oneplus no longer do phones with capacitance fingerprint readers either, so I can't even solve the problem by going back to them.   Not being able to use biometrics to access the phone, and things like banking banking, is such a pain. And not being able to use a screen protector on my S22 U is turning out to be extremely expensive.  If anyone has a solution, please let me know! Thanks",androidsever,1kovyuj

"Should I Factory Reset? Recently, my Android Vivo phone has auto-downloaded about 6 games from the Play Store without me doing anything. It was like Temu, Shoppee, 2 Puzzle Games and others I dont remember. I uninstalled the apps and this hasnt happened again but it still really stresses me out so I was wondering if I should factory reset to be safe? There are no other warnings signs except it being slow but that is probably cuz my phone is an old model and has very little RAM. I scanned using BitDefender but it said no issue, Play Protect too if that helps. I checked too and the last security update was in 2022, maybe instead of a factory reset, it is time for a new phone?

"[Help] S22 Ultra Snapdragon - System UI & Process System Not Responding Constantly, Tried Everything Hey everyone, I'm seriously at my wit’s end with my S22 Ultra (Snapdragon, 8GB RAM, S908U1). Over the past 2 months, the phone has become borderline unusable due to constant stutters and freezing. I get repeated pop-ups saying “System UI not responding” and “Process system not responding” — especially when switching apps or opening the camera or basically anywhere in the System UI. Oddly, the phone runs fine without lags or stutters during gaming non stop for hours.   Here’s everything I’ve tried so far:  1. Factory Reset – Multiple times. Works fine for a few hours, then the lag and stutters return.   2. Flashed non-carrier firmware using Odin (U1 firmware).   3. Wipe cache partition from recovery – no improvement.   4. Cleared device cache/data manually for major system apps like System UI, Play Services, etc.   5. Disabled/Enabled RAM Plus – didn’t help either way.   6. Replaced the battery – mine had 1130+ charge cycles and hit 36°C idling. New battery didn’t solve the problem.   7. Safe Mode – Still stutters occasionally.   8. Minimal app install post-reset – no improvement.   9. Tried full Odin reflash with NAND ERASE ALL and reset – issue persisted.   10. Checked usage/storage – everything is within safe limits.   11.

I want a phone that has a big battery life that does not wear as iphone does in time, good camera (dosent get the photos blurry. So i dont care about the specs as much but about how well the photos actually look), nice screen and refresh rate, fast, DOSENT GET HOT, charges fast, and is actually durable to normal day use (i dont play games or if i do they are not demanding). Money isnt really a problem but i dont want the worst, low-price, nor the latest, most expensive, either. Something at a normal price. Oh and a nice color.

"Looking for the best android as a new dad I want to start this with I am not always very smart. Things that seem obvious don't always seem as such to me, but I'm pretty good with data absorption and processing. That said, I've gone on GSM Arena, looked at on r/GooglePixel and r/SamsungGalaxy and I can't seem to find a good consensus for the device that would be best for me. I would not consider myself a power user.  I'm a new dad in his mid-30s. My partner has a toddler from a previous relationship, and we have an infant together. I currently have a Samsung S25 Ultra as my daily driver, and a Pixel 8a as a backup device. I notice that if I want to take candid shots of the kids playing or doing literally anything, the Samsung phone is a poor choice. Even though it gets me high resolution photos, that doesn't matter when it looks like my kid's face is going through warpdrive or they have wings instead of arms. The Pixel on the other hand doesn't have that issue, but it does seem to wash out the colors and gives me lower resolution pictures. The lower resolution isn't as big of a deal, but the poor coloring matters to me. I'm not camera savvy, so I don't even know how to begin tweaking the camera settings to do what I want to do.  The more minor side is that I do play games on my phone (mainly Pokemon Go), and would like it to actually run, as the toddler likes to sit with me and tap the screen to ""help"" catch Pokemon and battle. I am currently essentially fully in the Samsung ecosystem, as I have the Galaxy Buds, Watch Ultra, Galaxy Ring, and even a Samsung TV. I know Pixel has their own buds/watch, and I can still use my Samsung stuff with another device, but I felt that might be relevant information.  Are there any suggestions for a device that would 1.) Help me get great shots of my kids, and 2.) enable me to still have my personal activities functioning without significant performance drops?

"Bluetooth pairing every time for my earbuds I've had this issue for few weeks now, where my earbuds (Joy TinySport) for my personal Android phone (Sony Xperia 10 III) require every time for me to manually select the device from the Saved devices list, approve the pairing using the dialog, and then I'm good to go.  Previously, everything worked well and the device got auto-connected after the earbuds' case is opened and the buds are activated, but I don't know what happened with my phone and now the pairing is required every time. I've checked with another Sony mobile, and the auto-pairing still works with that one for the same buds, so something's gone wrong with my phone and it's not about the buds. Also to add, every other devices' auto-connect works on my phone.  I haven't found any hits using internet searches.   I've tried removing the buds from the saved devices list using the Forget action and restarted the device. The pairing is done after that again normally, but after the initial pairing I get back to the manual pairing every time.  At times I also receive errors about ""invalid pairing code"" in my mobile, after which the buds are dropped from the saved devices list and require a new discovery+pairing. Changing the Input device toggle for the device doesn't work but gets reset in the mobile's setting for the buds.  As I've tried forgetting the device and that does not work, I'm wondering if my device's bluetooth devices database could be corrupted, and if there was a way to reset that completely? No direct setting for such action is available, but I use e.g. the Android development tools ADB to empty the database somehow?",androidsever,1kkpcle

"Excluding subdomain from urls open by default on Android Hi, did anyone tried to exclude specific subdomains from urls opened by default in the app on Android?  Our company has a url routing with lots of subdomains, and we need to navigate most of them to the app. I have a wildcard subdomain intent-filter defined in the AndroidManifest like this:            <intent-filter android:autoVerify=""true"">           <action android:name=""android.intent.action.VIEW"" />             <category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT"" />             <category android:name=""android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"" />                      <data android:scheme=""https"" />             <data android:host=""*.example.com"" />         </intent-filter>    But it seems that redirecting one of them to the app breaks the login flow in the mobile web.

"Android Game Audio Loss After Backgrounding (Multiple Devices) Seeking input on a consistent audio issue I'm observing across my Android devices (Samsung S23+ [Android 14], Oppo Find N5 [Android 15], and Samsung S25U [Android 15]). The problem arises when a game is sent to the background and then resumed. While the game state is preserved in RAM (no relaunch), the audio output ceases entirely.  I've specifically encountered this on games like Balatro and Girls' Frontline 2 (GFL2). This behavior has been observed after varying periods in the background, sometimes as short as one minute. The only temporary solution I've found is to force close the game and relaunch it, which restores the audio. I'm curious if other users have encountered a similar problem with these or other games, and if there are any known causes or solutions related to Android's audio management or background app behavior.  Is this a game bug or is this a device issue or is it an OS issue?  has anyone encountered anything like this happening?",androidsever,1kki0s9

"Samsung Galaxy A53 5G stuck in boot loop Hey everyone,  I'm dealing with a pretty frustrating situation and would really appreciate some insight before I take action.  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy A53 5G   **Issue:** The phone is stuck in a boot loop — it turns on, shows the Samsung logo, and then restarts endlessly. I can no longer access the recovery menu, and safe mode doesn’t work either.   **What does work:** I *can* access **Download Mode**, which suggests the bootloader is still functional.  This all started suddenly right after I opened an app I use every day. The phone froze and rebooted — and since then, it hasn’t gotten past the Samsung logo.  I've done some research and read that flashing the official firmware with the **HOME\_CSC** file (instead of CSC) using Odin *might* reinstall the system without erasing user data.  However, I’m dealing with a bit of a dilemma:  * I have **some data** on the phone that I’d really like to preserve since the last backup. * I **never enabled USB debugging**, so ADB backup is not possible, right? * I’m hesitant to take it to a repair shop because of **privacy concerns,** the likelihood that they’ll **wipe** the device, and of course because I'd be happy to **save money**. * The system crash seemed to happen randomly; no root, no ROMs, no mods. Just stock Android and a possible bad update or system corruption.  **My questions:**  1. Has anyone here **successfully recovered from a boot loop like this by flashing with HOME\_CSC** and kept their data? 2. Do you know any safe sites to get the official firmware from? 3. Is there any risk that the process could still wipe data or make things worse (ofc if the flash won't be interrupted by some unpredictable events)? 4. Are there any important precautions I should take before proceeding? 5. Would you trust this method over sending it in for service?  Any help, tips, or personal experiences would mean a lot.

"help Hey everyone!  I need your help in choosing a new phone, and I value your opinions! I’ve narrowed it down to three options:   Redmi Note 14 (4G) Realme 12 (4G) Samsung Galaxy A16   (all these are basic versions, not pro or plus models, as my budget is limited)  A little about my needs:  I'm not a heavy gamer, and I don’t take tons of photos, so camera quality isn’t my top priority, but I do need a decent one for capturing clear images, as my job involves sharing documents and notes. Battery life, display quality, and overheating issues,multi tasking are super important to me, as I’m a heavy media consumer. On weekends, I watch 8-10 hours of movies or shows, so I need a phone that can handle long hours of screen time without lagging or overheating.   I hate when phone lag.   I've heard that Redmi phones sometimes face heating issues, which has made me a bit hesitant about going with that option.

"How to record a conference/interview/meeting on Android? Hi. I use tablet for audio calls and video/audio conferences — it handles that well, but I want to be able to record them. The default app doesn’t support this task.  Tablet: Xiaomi Pad 6, Android version 14, no root   For conferences use 1MORE SonoFlow Bluetooth headphones   ### What I’ve already tried:  1. Apps from Google Play — screen recorders, audio recorders, and other tools for recording VoIP calls.   Later I found a discussion on this topic. In short: Google banned call recording starting with Android 10.  2. Connected the tablet to a laptop (Linux Mint) and tried to record using OBS.   Problems: audio desynchronization (my voice and the other person’s), and trouble getting the tablet’s front camera output.   I couldn’t get it to work properly — possibly due to internet speed or because the laptop is too old. Laptop: ASUS X507MA-EJ056, Linux Mint  3. Experimental: Ordered headphones with built-in call recording support — Xiaodu Smart Buds Pro White.   Many reviews mentioned defects and quick failure, but I still gave it a try. Got defective units from two different stores, so I gave up on this idea.   I know there are ways to unlock the needed functionality via root or flashing an Indian firmware, but I don’t want to go that route for personal reasons.  ### Expected result:  **Acceptable:** audio recording (my voice + the other person's), quality doesn't matter   **Ideal:** 1080p video + 2 separate audio tracks (my voice and the other person’s)   **Important:** it shouldn’t depend on a specific app (should work in browser, app)",androidsever,1kiszqy

I’ve tried to do plenty of googling on this topic and it’s hard to get clear answers how group chats work now. I’m fine with losing some of my experience but I don’t want to ruin it for everyone else.  Are there any other big concerns making the switch one might not think of before they do? Again I’m not really in the ecosystem I use mostly 3rd party apps, I have an Apple Card I don’t use so I can ditch that, and I use an iPad at work occasionally but it’s blue collar type stuff where I don’t need seamless communication with my phone or anything.    If there’s a better place that I should be asking these questions please point me in the right direction, thank you!",androidsever,1ki6v3u
"Make my android phone mine This is a cross post because I don't know where to ask this.  Linux is fantastic. Android should be great. I have a samsung S21, just upgraded to the One UI 7. And I hate it. I hated it before because it treats me like an idiot. and I hate it more now because simple customizations are not there.      Is there an opensource, or otherwise, way to make my phone mine? Rather than locked behind samsung yunk, and bottled into their usage paths? I think android is the only os available, but is there a better UI. Smaller, more compact, more customizable.  I'm not thrilled with the idea of just using a launcher. I want all the junk removed, not hidden in the background. Unless I totally don't understand the Kernel>OS>UI interaction. and the launcher IS the UI.",androidsever,1khsfiv
"The minutes on my phone's clock go by too fast! During a sleepless night, I would close my eyes, look at the time on my phone, try and close my eyes again for a short time, and then look at my phone again to realize that too much time had passed on my phone clock.  This didn't seem right to me. I have a pretty good internal body clock, so I usually always know what time it is or how much time has passed. Thinking I was going nuts, I timed each minute on my phone clock, and lo and behold, the minutes are only lasting between 45 seconds and 52 seconds.  Each time it varies, but a minute never lasts 60 seconds. (I'm timing the minutes at nighttime when people should be sleeping) What kind of mind screw is this, and why is this happening?

"Worse battery life on s21 after last OS update My phone used to reliably last 1 to 2 days on a single charge, depending on use. Despite being 4 years old, it is still an excellent phone. However as of two days ago, I just notice since the last update the battery is draining a lot faster. I did use the phone a bit more yesterday, but today's use was very reasonable and it still drained quite a lot.  In power saving settings, i have the following checked:   - Limit CPU speed to 70% - Turn off always on display (it was not on, anyways) - Decrease brightness by 10% - Set Motion Smoothness to standard  I have a feeling some new background process I am not aware of is now consuming more power than before. My WIFI, Bluetooth, Mobile Data, and Location are still always on. But that hasn't changed since the last update.  Is there some new thing active I can hopefully turn off somewhere in the settings to save a significant amount of battery usage?",androidsever,1kharej

"How useful is fast charging beyond 30 W? I see phones advertised with charging speeds 60 and 90 watts, and I see not much use in that apart from bragging about numbers.  Charging at 15 W for 30 minutes gives 7.5 Wh of energy, which is more than what most phones can hold. Accounting for lower efficiency, I think that it would reliably charge a common 5Wh battery in 30 minutes. That is enough for that I would get up in the morning, let the phone charge, have breakfast, do hygiene, and the phone would be charged by then.  I never had a phone which could charge at more than 15 W, and I don't miss faster charging. I see some appeal of 30W charging because that could theoretically charge the battery to 50 % in 5 minutes, which may be useful in emergency, but I think that numbers beyond that have diminishing returns.  I want to gather other opinions about that. How useful is fast charging at more than 30 W for you? Would you miss it if you could charge at only 30 or 15 W?",androidsever,1kgs870

"Finding lost device Hi folks. My sister recently dropped her phone a short distance outside our house. I'm looking for some advice to potentially find it.  We've tried looking for it manually, but as it's basically mud and hay in that area, we think it may have gotten slightly buried, and we're worried about burying it more.  We've also tried using google's find my device feature, but it couldn't connect to the phone - presumably the signal's too weak. We do have a router out there that the phone should be able to connect to, but moving the router around to try to get the phone a signal would be a pain, so I'm keeping that as a last resort if possible.  I've tried calling it from my phone, but it went to voicemail, and we're pretty sure her phone is on silent anyway.  Her phone apparently had about 70% battery on it when she last had it, so it shouldn't be dead.     Are there any ways to track it down that I haven't thought of?

"HTC U23 Pro - sudden battery drain issue Hello, I'm hoping I'm in a good sub for this, apologies if not.  I have a year and a bit old HTC U23 Pro and for the entire year the battery life has been great. I could cleanly do a day from a full charge and longer depending on my usage.  For additional context, I work seven to ten hours a day, and for those ten hours I have recently not kept my phone on me.   Over the course of the past week my battery life has fallen off of a cliff, with my phone draining while not in use at work from a full charge down to 40-25% by end of day. Screen off, no apps running, no other clear indicators.  It was bad enough one day that I had assumed I had not charged it the day before, but I now realise that is not the case.  All common troubleshooting and security checks I believe I have done including power cycling the phone multiple times, virus scanning, checking for rogue apps and bizarre app behaviour - there is nothing clear occouring.   Inside of the battery use in the system screen (I have a screenshot) the percentages don't even come close to a full amount for use of power - missing around 70% to 80% of power usage stats if I am reading the data correctly.   Posting to see if there are any obvious troubleshooting steps I have missed, if anyone knows if it is a common issue or not and also next steps for me to take!  HTC U23 Pro Android 13 (all up to date as far as I can tell)    Can provide any and all further information as needed.  EDIT: additional information - it appears if I disable all network connectivity the battery usage drops considerably, or if I am in a dead zone for WiFi and mobile networks - I discovered this while at a wedding at the weekend where my battery usage seemed a lot more stable  In addition, when recently restarting my phone for the first 10-20 minutes of it being on it showed an option to system update that I could not click on (in the notifications bar, displayed as usual).

Hi there  Hoping for some advice please because I just realised I don't actually understand how my photo storage and backups work, and it feels suddenly extremely overwhelming.   I have OneDrive and Google Drive and Google Photos/Samsung Gallery onmy phone.  Atm all my photos auto-backup to One Drive and Google Drive is apparently full.  I assumed One Drive and Google Drive just existed for things I manually uploaded. Apparently not.  I just dug into Google Drive when it said ""storage full"" and found photos and videos from 2 years ago I know I manually backed up elsewhere.    Perhaps it is easier to say what I'd like the situation to be, and someone can advise if this is feasible or not please?  I'd like Google Photos and Gallery to stay as photo/video viewers on my phone.  I don't want files, photos or videos autobacking up to Google Drive.    I would like to keep One Drive photo autobackup, but I'd like to be able to still manually delete from one location and it remove the photo from both the cloud storage of One Drive and my phone simultaneous.  Apparently you can do this if you sync the photos?  But what I don't want to happen is for my phone to die and for me to then lose everything in the cloud.  It's just I take a lot of photos, screengrabs and image downloads. And I can't bear the idea of having to manually delete from two separate locations.

Today I went to add some new photos and most of the apps seem to be unable to find any photos anymore.

Since this is happening across so many different apps and not all of them are the same developer (not all of them belong to Match group), it seems to be an issue with the Android OS itself.

"Google Play services draining lots of battery and making phone very hot TLDR; Google Play services has been draining lots of battery and making my S10 very hot to the touch since last week. Nothing seems to help, short of doing a factory reset. What should I do?  I have a Samsung S10 and I used to get around 3-4 hours of SOT per day and 10 ish hours of use in total, until just over a week ago when Google Play services suddenly started draining my battery so quickly that it’d go from full to flat in around 3-4 hours. It didn’t seem to matter whether the screen was on or not — it’d still stay hot and keep draining battery, 20-30% per hour. Accubattery says power draw is often in excess of 3W.  I can’t diagnose what exactly is making the app use so much battery, because I’m on Android 10 and I can’t see what permissions the app has used recently. Battery optimisations can’t be applied to Google Play services either.  So far, having seen a bunch of other people on Reddit and other places run into what seems to be the same problem, I’ve tried: * clearing the app’s cache * clearing the app’s data * uninstalling all of the app’s updates (and reinstalling them) * clearing my phone’s cache partition  * turning on airplane mode * regularly restarting my phone  None of these have been lasting solutions. The only one that had some effect was resetting the Google Play services app to the factory version, after which battery usage seemed to return to normal if I let the phone rest for an hour or so after charging and unplugging it (which made me suspect it had something to do with sleep states, in whatever form they exist on Android), but this only lasted for a few days, after which it went back to draining battery at an alarming rate regardless of whether I let it rest before using it or not.

"Realistic chances of android phones getting infected by virus/malware? I figure I would ask people who actually use android systems....  I'll explain my situation below in detail, but after browsing i figured i would ask in general here the realistic chances of an android (samsung s23) phone catching malware/virus that is undetectable by av scanners etc....and if its true that the only way to be sure its gone/there is nothing there is to do a factory reset. I am not a tech person just a human being worried about my security on my phone and to get ahead of the repeat questions....  1.yes I keep data bases and updates current, I also have 2 factor auth on every work app that it's available for... 2. I only download a minimal amount of apps and only from the play store that I scan regularly  3. I don't browse nsfw, or other sketchy sites that I am aware of on my phone (im a boring late 30s married chick who basically goes to work and comes home a wild night for me is book club, riskiest thing I've got as an app on my phone is Facebook, Instagram, and ticktock) 4. I wouldn't know how to jail break my phone or why I would want to if I tried...  Basically had an incident with my phone and in researching the risks I have gotten vastly different vibes and answers....typically it follows the age old arguments of: whether android is as secure as iphone(seems similar nowadays), phones can't or can get virus/malware, play store is enough vs av or av does no good on phones and is inept so just use play store(i dont understand that one at all). Then there is the side themes of which av and how x,y,z all sell your data or the Russians are involved, to nuke the phone your being hacked, or just people being a holes making sarcastic replies and being rude because someone is not as tech savy as them....google searches are a whole other beast and basically if you weren't terrified your phone was sleeper hacked and all your info stolen while you selpt before you will be after...granted most of those are from Ai search or from articles of av companies....  I've posted similar in another forum and on my other account and I seem to get two themes of answers Basically was clearing emails on Gmail and opened a reddit one to see the comment left of a post, fat fingered it while scrolling and it opened the link to definitely not my inbox or post (nsfw content somehow even though the email said description of my post on other account)....closed it out reported it as spam from browser, marked email as spam....cleared cache restarted phone scanned now with 3 different av software(trialing avg, Bitdefender, and malware bytes and dont love any of the 3)....please spare me the av on phones isn't needed rely on the play store it makes me feel better to have extra.... The only weird things I've noticed is my wallet app moved itself which has happened with other apps (google irritates me by auto updating my cards so I don't keep payment info on my phone) so i just deleted it. And my avg webshield turned off but after a search that appears a common issue based on posts.  All 3 apps have said no virus/malware...I do use my phone for work so I am extra paranoid.

"Enable all disabled apps at once Hi!   Is there any way to enable all apps at once?   The auto app disable feature is driving me crazy, because every time I want to use an app which I don't use very often it requires an update. It's especially annoying with store loyalty apps.   It's particularly delightful when I'm standing at the checkout, desperately trying to open the store app to show my loyalty card — only to find it refuses to start because it *must* update first. Of course, it hasn’t updated because apparently, disabled apps live in some kind of digital coma and don’t update themselves. And as far as I can tell, there’s no way to turn off this *brilliant* feature. So now I just hope there’s some magical way to periodically resurrect all my apps so they can update and be graciously available when I actually need them.  UPD: It looks like I solved the issue putting all apps to the ""Unrestricted"" battery mode.  adb shell pm list packages -d >> appslist.bat   adb shell pm list packages -d >> appslist2.bat  then autoreplaced ""package:"" with ""adb shell dumpsys deviceidle whitelist +"" in appslist.bat with notepad   then autoreplaced ""package:"" with ""adb shell cmd package install-existing "" in appslist2.bat with notepad   and then just executed these .bat files  Thanks to u/doubleudeaffie  UPD2: It didn't help.

However, it seems that i am unable to factory reset the phone and delete all the apps and data that she has. I made a copy of her photos on my Mac as that's the only thing i need to keep.  What i tried so far:  * Factory resetting from the Settings menu. That does not work. I choose to delete all data, confirm the two warning messages and the phone restarts. It boots up with a loading screen that increases up to ±3%, then jumps to 100% and the phone immediately restarts. However, it restarts without having deleted anything. Tried this like 10 times. * Factory reset from the Safe Boot menu. Again, does not work. Same loading bar that goes up to 3%, then the phone displays a message that factory reset failed and only gives me a single button to go back to the main menu. Trying again yields the same results. * Updating to the latest software and removing the sim card before resetting. Updates do not work. The update downloads, then a message saying that ROM could not be installed appears and the download restarts. It then enters an endless loop where the phone downloads the update, attempts to install it and fails to install the ROM. So i cannot install the latest update either. The phone had beed switched off for about a year. * Removing all accounts from her phone. Again, does not work. Same failed factory reset message.

"Pre-15 style notifications on Android 15? My Fold recently updated to Android 15 and it's been... Interesting. A lot of little irritations that I've been trying to iron out and, for the most part, I've got my phone back to a familiar state.  The biggest problem I'm having (that I have yet to find a solution for) is the way notifications are grouped now. Let me lay out an example. In older versions of Android, if I got multiple messages to one of my gmail accounts, I would get the notification icon on the top of the screen. When I pull down the shade and tap the Gmail notification, it would take me straight to my inbox where I could proceed as I will. (Check multiple messages, delete them, read them, whatever.) On 15, however, the way multiple notifications are grouped behaves very differently. Now, if I get multiple emails to one of my accounts, I get the notification icon as before. But when I pull down the shade and tap Gmail notification, it expands into small summaries of each email. I then have to tap one of them to go to that specific message, delete it (or whatever), and THEN go to my inbox and address the rest.  I get a lot of junk mail. Being able to go straight to the inbox and address them was so much nicer. Now, being forced to go to one of these messages BEFORE I can go back out to the inbox is very aggravating. Does anyone know if there's a way to make it behave as it once did?  (For the record, this also happens with Outlook.)",androidsever,1kd2kbv

I have a Samsung S22 ultra with 2 simcards, an Italian and a Spanish simcard, not the national nor the roaming sim work when I'm at neither country. I tried the simcards on another phone and it worked perfectly, I'm actually using the other phone as a Hotspot for the moment.  I'm trying to avoid factory reset, just for the annoyance of logging in on everything again, and also I must do something wrong because I always lose some things on the  back-ups.  I already tried:  -restarting the phone  -turning on and off mobile data -turning on and off airplane mode  -updating APN in the network settings for both simcards  -disabling the second simcard -updating operating system (was already up to date)  -wiping cache partition.  If you have any ideas, I'd appreciate the feedback. Thanks",androidsever,1k9y94g
Decent Office app for android Is there an office app that fulfils the following criteria:  1. Has functionality similar to (or at least includes the most common stuff) desktop apps (docs and ppts primarily)  2. Doesn't require signing in or creating accounts  3. Doesn't include ads/shady practices  4. Preferably open source     I have tried various mainstream stuff and it always falls short in one way or another. It is frustrating to not have any decent app despite having devices that are more than capable of handling documents and presentations. Would be thankful for some recommendations,androidsever,1k9qt27

"Notifications auto-dismissed and play no sound since ColorOS 15 update Hi there,  Desperately looking for some help with my Oppo A78 5G after the latest OS update. Something strange has happened to my notifications - they either do not appear in my notification tray, disappear instantly after flashing the icon in the tray for a second, or disappear within a matter of seconds after the pop-up appears sometimes if I happen to be actively using the device and see the notification come in. They frequently do not even make a notification sound.  I can tell the notifications are coming through correctly even when they don't appear in tray as they show up under recently dismissed (despite me not interacting with them), and if I am watching a full screen video or listening to music, I can hear the volume lower as it arrives, but no sound is played. I have checked my notification volume and it hasn't changed, tried tinkering with power settings and notification permissions and nothing seems to change. I rely on app notifications for a lot of important things (email and Discord primarily) and losing them makes me feel like I'm half blind.  Thanks for any help in advance.",androidsever,1k8bgkt

"Questions about how photos/backup/albums work I'm a recent iOS partial-convert, and while I'm really loving most of the experience with my Galaxy Z Flip6, trying to transfer my photo library over has been a pain. It was fairly seamless getting the photos and albums from my iCloud Photo Library to my Galaxy using Smart Switch, but I have a photo library dating back over 15 years with tens of thousands of photos, and a good handful of albums with hundreds of pictures in them, and I don't want to keep them all on-device as they take up around 100GB of storage.   I've been bouncing between Google Photos and OneDrive for my backups/sync, but I'm not sure I understand how they work. The ""Albums""/""Collections"" tabs on either don't have any albums available unless I create them in the app (whereas I'd like them to create albums based on the ones on my phone). I don't understand the difference between Gallery Sync and Camera backup on OneDrive, or between just regular Backup and Back up device folders on Google Photos. I also don't understand why, in apps that use the default Android Media Picker, only a tiny portion (but not none!) of my albums show up, with only a tiny portion of their photos visible. It's like there's two different photo library systems, and I can't figure out how either of them work. I can't figure out if there's a way for me to keep *access* to my entire sorted history of photos (if I'm connected to the internet) without keeping the entire library stored on-device, and to select specific albums I'd like to keep downloaded, etc.  Basically, what I want to know how to do is:   1. Fully back up my entire photo history, in order, and sorted into the albums I see in the Gallery app;  2. Free up space on the device by storing most of the photos/videos in the cloud backup, but without them disappearing from the Gallery app;  3. Select specific albums/folders I want to keep downloaded on my device (but also backed up to the cloud still! Not just excluded from backup);  4. Store my albums on-device in a way that will let me see them in the Media Picker.  I'm hoping to figure this out, because googling hasn't helped much, and backing up ~75k photos/videos to two different cloud services two times each has taken up an *immense* amount of time and battery life (it's currently still backing up to Google Photos), and the only way to make it faster is to give it unrestricted battery permissions and keep the app open in the background, both of which quickly cause the phone to overheat while draining the battery by a percent or two every minute. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or misunderstanding, I just want to have my pics backed up, sorted in their albums, and selectable from the media picker lol.  As mentioned, device is Galaxy Z Flip6, One UI 7, US if that matters.",androidsever,1kju3yt
"Massive Battery Drain Randomly Showed Up One Day I have a OnePlus phone, about 4 years old. It has generally used 25-30% battery each day with moderate to heavy use. However, starting last week, my phone started getting really hot and staying hot while it was in my pocket, and it drains to 0% by dinnertime. I'm down from 100% to 70% by 10 AM, and I haven't really even used it. In fact, my battery usage stats say that I've used something like a total of 45 minutes of screen time that day, and my phone has used 85% of its battery life. WTF is going on?!  Today, I even tried putting it on Battery Saver mode all day, AND making sure many individual apps were not running in the background by switching their permissions, and it basically didn't do anything. My phone still died while I was driving home after dinner time.  I have noticed that Google Play Services and Google Play Store are the main battery hogs, but neither is ever open - they must just be running in the background, but I can't figure out what to do about them. Do I just need to buy a new phone? A new battery? Or is this fixable?  Thank you for any insight!",androidsever,1kjrm64

"Phone sluggish and battery draining quickly Hi all, I'm having an issue with my phone. It is a Moto G Stylus 5G 2022 running Android 13. Within the past week it is suddenly slow and dying quickly.  I used to be able to get to the end of the day and still have 30-40% left. Now I am hitting that percentage by noon and I have to charge to make it through the rest of the day. My phone consistently feels warm which it almost never did before. The animations stutter, especially scrolling, swiping, and loading animations, particularly when the phone is trying to load something. It almost never did any of this a week ago.  The only thing I can think of that changed is that I have been having issues getting my phone to connect wirelessly to android auto in my car, which also started a week ago. I've changed settings trying to get that to work but the majority of them have been in the android auto app itself and not the phone settings.  I've attached pictures of my battery settings and memory usage. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!",androidsever,1kjj1nn
"Need Android Camera Recommendation - Coming from Work iPhone 15 Hey everyone!  I recently had to return my iPhone 15, which was provided by my workplace, and now I'm on the hunt for a new Android phone to replace it. Before the iPhone, I was using a Realme GT 2 Pro and have had several LG phones in the past, so I'm familiar with the Android ecosystem. One of the things I really loved about the iPhone 15 was its camera – the image quality was very good.  I'm currently considering the following phones, which are all in a very similar price range where I am:  * Xiaomi 14T Pro * Motorola Edge 50 Ultra * Realme GT 7 Pro * Google Pixel 8 Pro 128gb (refurbished) * Nubia Z60S Pro * Sony Xperia 1 V (also refurbished , though I'm a bit hesitant due to potential future update limitations)  My main focus is the camera. I'm looking for a phone that can match or even exceed the camera performance of the iPhone 15, especially in terms of image quality and consistency. Low-light photography is also important to me. While the camera is my top priority, I'd also like a phone with a good processor so I can do some light video editing directly on the device.  I'm not really considering Samsung at this time, but if you have any other recommendations outside of this list that might fit my needs and price range, I'd be happy to hear them!  Given these options (and any other suggestions you might have), which one would you suggest? I'd love to hear your experiences and insights, especially if you've compared them to the iPhone 15's camera, have experience with their low-light capabilities.  Thanks in advance for your help!",androidsever,1kjj0w9

"Upgrading from an S9 plus So I believe it is time to move on from this for two reasons, first it is not yet unusable and can still see myself using for few more years but because some of the apps I use no longer support the OS and system specs it is on(which is in one way to say ""*Go upgrade boomer*"") , the second I do want to upgrade to play few things(nothing massive on graphics just hog riding) but also want to keep my storage expandable.    I went to see couples this morning and saw a bit of a trend with Samsung late models, no SD cards so moving away from Samsung I saw few others and the ones that caught my attentions were Xiamoi Redmi phones as they had some decent prices for what they offer below 500$ where I live, there's also Realme phones(never heard of it before), Motorola Edge 50 Pro, and few more like Vivo.    After going through here's what I found myself stuck in since I don't want to over spend more than my S9 plus(which I bought on sale for roughly 550$) here's what I decided to do, I'll list the phones that I found to be a good candidate for replacement eventhough some won't have SD card slot and help me which should go for or is there a better suggestion.    Here are the list: Samsung Galaxy S24 FE 5G 256GB(529$), Samsung Galaxy A56 256GB 5G(389$), Motorola Edge 50 Pro 12GB 512GB(469$), Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 Pro+ 5G 512GB(439$)   So far the best contender the Note 14 for storage and price but Motorola seems to be a potential contender when looking at the specs and price and not to mention both run android 14, is there a better option I should look out for?

"GPS lost signal using Google maps? I recently purchased a used android device (AQUOS zero6) and the phone has been functioning as expected except for one recent problem I've noticed: whenever I use Google maps it keeps losing my location and I hear the audio announcement ""GPS signal lost."" I also noticed that even if the GPS works while I'm driving, it seems to not perceive my exact location - it is always somewhat off. For example: the other day I put in the address for a Home Depot, and it told me I had arrived when I got to Target, which is the store on the preceding block. This has created some big problems for me when trying to navigate to a location in my car, but strangely enough it seems as soon as I stop driving a pull over, it once again finds my location accurately.  When I first looked into this I read that if the GPS isn't working it could mean the GPS is broken/defective in the phone, and I saw a recommendation to download apps for GPS status. So I did that, but it's the same story: the status app seems to report location accurately, but Once I start moving - even just walking around my house - I will get the message GPS signal lost from Google maps.  What could be going on here? Is there a fix for this? Or does this still indicate some sort of defect in the phone GPS system itself?",androidsever,1kjffsy

"Galaxy S23 Ultra's wifi connections are always spotty, also having trouble with using phone as car key I'm trying to determine if this is a hardware issue, or if there's settings I can fix somewhere.        I've isolated the issue to this phone with wifi and whatever connection my car uses (probably bluetooth), not the wifi network and not other connection types (ie cellular data).  Since the day I got this phone roughly 8 months ago, it's been inconsistent about connecting with wifi. While on wifi, apps will often tell me I'm offline, web pages take forever to load, etc. Turning off wifi and using data fixes these issues. This happens with every wifi network I connect to, and other devices/people use my home wifi network without issue. Since I could always switch to data, this wasn't a big deal, but recently I bought a car (2024 Mustang Mach E) which uses phone as a key, and roughly 1/4 of the time, it won't recognize that I have my phone on me.        The internet tells me my car uses bluetooth to do phone as a key. My phone has no issue connecting to the car via bluetooth for playing music and such, but frequently doesn't work as a key. I do occasionally get stuttering music with both my car speakers and other speakers in my house. I don't know if wifi and bluetooth use the same hardware or what.        Given that this issue has been ongoing since literally the day I got this phone, I'm inclined to believe this is a hardware issue and I need to get a replacement.

"Data Recovery Help Needed ASAP T-Mobile’s customer service agents’ bad tech support instructions blue bricked my Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus+ Model # SM-S926U Cell Phone. I went to the T-Mobile Store today, but the staff refused to even try to restore it, they would only agree to order a replacement cell phone device unit per my protection plan, and it seems like I will need to give them the blue bricked one when I return on Friday to pick it up. So I desperately need help getting all of my lost data files back.    The latest Android software operating system update had new completely unnecessary style motions that I could not turn off (I swear the buttons that allegedly turn them off are placebo effect nonsense) that were giving me migraines, the same migraine-inducing completely unnecessary style motions that Apple iPhone installed years ago that were half the reason I switched (along with that nausea-inducing shade of neon green). The T-Mobile customer service agents told me I could go back to the previous version easily by setting my phone in “developer mode”, downloading the Samsung USB drivers to my laptop, and using the Odin tool as directed to revert it back again. I downloaded the previous firmware as instructed and the Odin tool ran it, saying “PASS.” My cell phone was supposed to re-start in the old Android software operating system as normal, but instead it returned to the blue “download in progress/do not disconnect device” screen again, per the linked YouTube video below.     [     This is not my first tech support rodeo, so I turned everything off then back on again – my laptop and my cell phone. I repeatedly asked T-Mobile’s customer service agents to explain each step in plain language, because I am not a software developer and the instructions they were copy-pasting into the chat were clearly written for people who speak that specialty foreign language, not for me – but apparently my requests did not mean anything to them, because I had to look up the step of holding both volume buttons down at once to enter “download mode” to use the Odin tool, using this YouTube video above, because they “forgot” to tell me that step in their instructions.    T-Mobile did not say I needed to remove my passcode to unlock the phone before using the Odin tool, and I had no reason to think that because I do not need to remove my passcode to do a software update. The Odin tool did not display that particular warning message on auto-launch after the installation was successful either. The Odin tool only displayed that warning message after the first failure prompted me to turn everything off and on again.     I was in denial, so I ran the Odin tool twice more, got “PASS” twice more, and had my cell phone re-start in the blue “download in progress/do not disconnect device” screen twice more.    T-Mobile said this process would be as quick and easy as a software update, not that it would be as intense as a device upgrade and transfer, so I have a ton of important .”PDF” and “.JPEG”/”.JPG” files that I need restored ASAP for legal reasons, because they never told me to back up everything-everything, just the usual basic Samsung settings files.    So: Please help me get my data back. I do not need lectures on backing everything-everything up, I need solutions for getting my data back now.     I have downloaded multiple file recovery tools – including Samsung Smart Switch, FoneLab For Android, Minimal ADB & Fastboot, iMyFone D-Back For Android, WonderShare RecoverIt, UltData For Android, and DroidKit. But none of them even recognize my cell phone, even as an external hard drive or other data storage device besides a cell phone. I connect my cell phone with the USB cable, my laptop dings the sound of recognition from the Samsung USB drivers as it did before I used the Odin tool, but the cell phone refuses to appear as a recognized device in any of the free trial versions that I downloaded. And again, the T-Mobile customer service agents had me put my cell phone in ""developer mode"" and change the USB cable from ""charging"" to ""data transfer"" status use on the cell phone screen itself, before I started using the Odin tool, so I am baffled as to why the USB connection and cell phone recognition step of these file recovery tools is where these processes keep failing. I do not have the money to just pay for the better full version of all of these file recovery tools, especially when none of them can even show me previews of the files to guarantee that any of them are actually still on my cell phone at all. So if there is one y’all can actually vouch for as worth spending money on, I would love to hear more.    The closest authorized Samsung repair shop is an hour’s drive each way and not available for me to e-mail in advance, obviously I cannot call them, I am disabled and I do not drive, and it already took me six days to arrange the favor of today’s trip to the T-Mobile Store and Friday’s future return trip. It took until yesterday to even find a neighbor whose wi-fi internet I could use too, because the housing development I live in is for poor elderly and disabled people, where I am the youngest and most tech-savvy person here at age 38. So really my only option of getting my files back before Friday is y’all telling me how to DIY this.",androidsever,1khgpuq

I cannot get it to come back on or turn off completely as it keeps resetting itself.  This has been going on for a solid 2 hours at this point. I cannot shut it down, boot into safe mode or get the recovery menu up.  It did this for about an hour before on the same but then turned on for 3 hours before starting the same issue again. I would just like it to move past this screen but have tried everything suggested online and nothing is working.

Edit**  Made this post in a bit of a panic at 3am so wanted to add more context. Issue started when I tried to charge my phone at work about 2pm then wasn't fully back on till about 5pm. The phone would periodically switch on then go back to its logo restart screen.   Once it came back on I had zero issues until I tried to charge it again where it only did this restart for about 40 minuets. When I tried to then get the data off it onto my old phone it then crashed again and I haven't got it turned on since.

"Opinions and help for Samsung Buds2. Hi all,     I have currently got a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds2. I have had them since April 2022. When I have ambient sound or noise-cancelling enabled they provide a high pitched screech which is probably going to give me hearing loss in the future. The only way to stop this is by turning off ambient sound/ noise-cancelling.      I have tried various ways of cleaning the buds (cotton swab, cloth, toothbrush, etc.) but these don't solve the issue.      As it's been three years I wonder whether it is worth replacing them. The noise-cancelling doesn't do a great job if I'm being honest, and like I said before, the squeaking is unbearable.   Is it worth buying next generation Samsung earbuds? I've recently read that the same squeaking noise is present with the latest edition of buds, and that's off putting.

Help consolidate data from 2 phone I broke the screen on my main phone a few months ago and I've been using my back up for a few months (both samsung).

Everything was fine before (battery was changed in November 2024). There are the different weird behaviors encountered:  \- The battery drops from 70% to 40% instantly (numbers are an example, sometime it is 90% to 10%)  \- The battery drops 1% every few seconds (starting from between \~98% and \~30%).  \- When the battery starts to drop crazy fast, if I restart the phone (safe mode or not) with still some battery left, the battery is at 0% and the phone shut down right after.  \- If it drops to 0% crazy fast, I charge it to a few % and then it can last the time it was supposed to (the battery percent doesn’t drop until the battery starts being empty).  I did a factory reset on the phone, no change. I flashed last version of lineage OS (with Gapps), no change. I did multiple battery calibration (x% -> 100% -> 0% -> 100%) in safe mode or not and nothing changed.  One way to not have the problem is to be on safe mode, and then I can have \~10h of video maximum light (which means the battery is probably full capacity). I did that experiment a few times.  I tried twice to limit the charge to 85% and it seemed to be OK.  I tried once to flash Lineage OS without Gapps, and I had a full day without problem (video and internet).

"(2025) Trying to find a better solution for iTunes library conversion and updating I bought an Android 4 years ago (Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus) switching away from iPhone 7. Not a fan of the Samsung, but I am now thinking of getting a new phone. I primarily use it for YouTube, some social media, some light digital board games, New Recruit for Warhammer Old World list building, my own ripped Blu-ray videos on my Plex server, and, most importantly, my music which is the focus of this post.  You see for over 2 decades I bought thousands of songs on iTunes, CDs, free and legal audio recordings of various sorts, and maybe not so legal means a long time ago (I rarely will grab music that way unless I physically can't buy it like some obscure JRPG music and fortunately I've been able to find that easily). 98% of my music is purchased through iTunes and thus I stuck with it despite not having any Apple Devices (I still do iTunes Match as I see no need to upgrade to Apple Music and it is a smaller once a year fee).  I want to do one of two things:     1. Convert all of my music out of iTunes and find an equivalent app to maintain, control, and curate my own music (NOT Spotify as I hate it on principle).  2. Find an app better than DoubleTwist to properly update my phone with the music I want.  DoubleTwist is a pain and does not properly update my library, playlists, and I constantly have to delete everything to start over just to update music. A plus in Apple's column is their Apple app is easy to sync even if you only have iTunes Match. So either I need to find an alternative to DoubleTwist or find a way to convert all of my music to MP3s and move them out of iTunes environment which is a bit of a project, but have a better long term solution. Or I return to Apple. This and some other features are the reason I am considering a return to Apple (reminders and calendar cohesion is a big reason to switch back to Apple and Samsung's Bixby is not as good as Apple's Siri which I find I use more often than I like to admit especially driving).  I got out of Apple because I hate planned obsolescence, but my wife is finding her iPhone 11 (or 12 I can't remember) is faring better than my Samsung of the same age (we both last bought new phones in early 2021). Androids tend to have better cameras and more storage space which is two of the big reasons (and the storage is a big deal with my enormous audio library and the use of PDFs, apps, and downloaded videos from Plex for trips).  Nonetheless, what have people done in the Android community who like their own music library and switched away from iTunes or used iTunes in conjunction with another app(s) in Android/Windows PC?",androidsever,1kh0wry

"Question about downgrading Samsung Tab E (sm-t560nu) I have a Samsung tablet (model sm-t560nu) with Android 7.1.1 on it. It's excruciatingly slow so I figured I'd try to downgrade it to 5.1. I already tried a couple firmware versions for 5 and 6, using Odin 3.14 to install them, but they don't seem to work properly, as I always end up in a reboot loop. Reinstalling 7 works flawlessly, so no damage has been done so far, at least. The firmware I found for 5 and 6 all have the same binary, same region, same everything, except that they're the ""home"" version, which from my understanding are keeping apps and other data, which might be why it's not starting properly. The firmware I have for 7 has the ap, bl, and csc files, but all other versions have only the ap file.  My question is; is there a way that I could downgrade to Android 5 or 6 in my situation? And if so, is there a place where I could download the required files? Or am I stuck with Android 7 forever?",androidsever,1kgbehb
What is going on with Android video audio? Last night I did maybe 4 or 5 videos on my android phone. I did maybe 2 on my tripod and a couple without. I've used this tripod several times to record videos and I've never had an issue. But the recordings I took on while using the tripod don't have sound. The only difference besides the tripod was that I have to take my phone case off to put it in there because it won't fit with my pop socket. I tried a few more videos this morning and there was audio in all of them. I also tried it on my tripod again and the audio worked. I had a dust plug in my charging port but since the audio works with it I know it's not that.

"Which phone to buy? Honor Vs Iqoo Vs Oppo Vs Realme Hey guys,  I'm buying a phone for my mom and currently torn between these 4 phones which are almost EXACTLY the same price in my place:   1) Iqoo Z9 5G (SD 7 Gen 3 version) 8+256GB 2) Honor X9C 8+256GB 3) Realme 12+ 5G 12+256GB 4) Oppo Reno12 F 12+256GB  My criteria:  1) Reliable day-to-day performance (obviously she's not a gamer) 2) Good, dependable primary and selfie camera (My mom likes to take a lot of pictures but she won't explore the camera features like ultrawide, filters etc). It has to be a reliable point and shoot. 3) Great call quality  4) Good battery life.  I'm actually leaning towards the Iqoo Z9 (coz her current phone is a Vivo and the Z9 has the best chipset of thee 4) but the lack of OIS and only 16mpx selfie camera seems to be a concern. In reality, how good or bad is the camera compared to the other 3 options?  The Oppo Reno12 F seems to have the overall best camera specs on paper. But not sure how good it actually is.  Realme is budget brand of Oppo. So not sure if it's wise to choose the Realme 12+ considering I can get the Oppo Reno12 F at the same price. How much of a difference does the MTK Dimensity 7050 make compared to the MTK D6300 on the Reno12 F? Any other pros in the Realme?  Honor doesn't support WiFi 6.

"Android Auto Connection Issues in 2025 Prius LE Hello! I was going to post my question in the Android Auto sub but they require more karma to post than I have so I figured I would try my luck over here and see if anyone has had this issue and knows how to solve it.  I got my new 2025 Prius LE on March 31st, so I've had it a little over a month now. This car has wireless android auto built in. For the first month wireless android auto worked pretty much perfectly with my phone (Moto G Stylus 5G 2022, Android version 13). Occasionally it would have an error connecting but it usually worked if I clicked on the ""Use for android auto"" button under my device in settings or if I just restarted the car before I started driving. So I really didn't have any issues with it.  I didn't drive my car last week because I was off work. I got back in on this past Saturday and noticed that android auto wasn't working at all wirelessly no matter what I tried. I didn't think too much of it and thought it would reset once I started the car again. As the day went on I realized it wasn't working at all. In the past few days I've tried everything I could think of. Restarting both my car and the phone, re-pairing over bluetooth, making sure apps were up to date in both the phone and the car, checking settings, turning on wifi and hotspot in the car, etc etc etc, nothing has worked. I have been able to get it to connect with a cable but even that is spotty and only works about half of the time.  The only thing I can think of that changed is that my 1 month AT&T data trial for the car expired at the end of April when I wasn't driving my car. I would rather not pay for data for the car, since I already pay for a good unlimited data plan for my phone and to my knowledge android auto doesn't require the car to have a data plan to function. Has anyone else had this issue and/or knows how to fix it? Thanks in advance!",androidsever,1kg8jfo

"One contact ring on silent Hello, I have a OnePlus 13, and I usually keep it on silent (so no ringing or noises or vibration but I still visually see all notifications for incoming calls and messages).  WITHOUT using DND, how can I allow specific contacts to audibly ring through on phone and/or WhatsApp despite phone being in silent mode?  unnecessary detail, if you want it --  I am away from my boyfriend in another country and we use an app to track each other's phones to make sure we're always safe (his idea and I'm totally fine with this especially when I'm traveling on my own).  Anyway, last night the location tracker did something weird while I was sleeping - and showed me a block away from my Airbnb (but somehow only on his side, my side on the same app shows I was home asleep and battery usage shows my phone wasn't even picked up at any point - showed him both on my side, honestly weird that they're different but that's a tangent) and this caused him to get worried all night because it showed me out of the house for 3 hours a block away. I'm in Mexico and the wifi isn't so good in this Airbnb. They charge for electricity here so I've been closing the bedroom doors at night so I just have to have AC on in the one room but it makes the wifi so crap I can't even watch Netflix in there with them closed. So I'm sure the location thing is some kind of glitch with the wifi cutting out and my sim card kicking in and just getting the location a little wrong. (I've seen this happen sometimes using Uber in some countries.)  In his worry he called like 15 times and my phone is always on silent so I never saw it till I woke up much later.  Anyway to avoid this happening again, I want to allow his calls only to ring through so that I can hear them (phone or WhatsApp or both), but no one else's, or maybe a couple other people. I never use DND because I still want to see notifications for everything without manually checking (also always thought DND is a bit shady like trying to hide stuff).

"I have a seems legit Oppo A78 5G phone but I feel like it's fake. I'm not that knowledgeable about technology but still I'm trying to learn and research so I would not fall on scams. But anyway, I got a prize money from a competition but it's only a small amount of money and we're also in below middle class family so we're kind of broke. My mother then suggested to buy a phone on our neighbor's online business. It seems really legit so we bought this Oppo A78 5G phone.  What caught us off guard was its storage. 512gb ROM and 12+4gb expandable RAM. It's so suspicious as in the post that our neighbor posted, it only have the 256gb and the 128gb which when I scrolled through a lot of websites that says the specs of this phone, it really do only have the 256gb and the 128gb.  Plus the Color OS blue setting in the About Phone of the original A78 was there. I don't have that one.  Also, I saw a video in YT that shows that Oppo A78 has that app menu where if you're in the homescreen, it will swipe up to have the full list of the games you have. This phone only have the usual homescreen where everything was in the homescreen only like the UI of the Oppo A3S.  Now what I did was I installed an app that let me see the original hardware of this phone. And it says that it only have 64gb ROM and 4gb RAM. I then decided to get the IMEI and finally get it checked on the official Oppo website and boy, the website shows that the phone that matches with the IMEI was the Oppo A8, not A78.  I then searched the specs of the Oppo A8 and it shows the same exact specs that the Device Info app gave to me as the real capacities of this phone. All through the CPU, GPU, Android version, Processor, and even the megapixels of its camera were all the same.  I saw a post here too that was posted about a year ago saying that there's an app that could fake a capacity of a phone.  It might be obvious by now that it's fake and I do believe it is fake but it still makes me confused.  The About Phone could be faked by an app but when I go to the real Storage setting, it says that it have 491gb. When I also go to the original File Manager of this phone, it says the same 491gb.  Yet when I tried installing the ZArchiver and Google Files, Files said it only have 32gb left while ZArchiver said it only have 26gb left. Which confuses me more since they aren't match as well so I don't really know which is right.  One thing also was the Task Manager of the phone. It do says there that there is 6gb total of RAM and a 4.54gb available RAM. It might not be the 12+4gb RAM in the About Phone but it definitely wasn't the 4gb of the Oppo A8.  Again, I am not knowledgeable in techs so I'm not debating whether I'm right or wrong but rather, deducting.  Since this occurence made me so curious on the legitimacy of this phone or that whether if it's fake, how do they even fake it like this.   I also wanna ask that if it displays 512gb means I could still really use the whole 512gb ROM or it's just a whole sh*t cover and the only storage I could actually use was 64gb only? I wanna ask if the 512gb were actually fully usable?  I seek help by answers, opinions, discussions, and explanation if this is a fake or not or how do they really even do this unnoticeable illegitimate phone.  I will let this sit and I'll read some of the comments this will get before I'll decide if I'll return it as I'm planning to return it right away especially that it only have a 7-day return policy.

But, since there's no USB debugging, that doesn't let me access the files.  \- I've got a decent but not perfect backup to Google One - photos should be ok but I'd still lose a lot of other data on a factory reset.  It feels like it shouldn't be impossible to get that data, which is clearly still there on the phone, and yet...  \- For completeness, device state is locked on fastboot.  \- Google Support not helpful (they suggested safe mode and then went straight to factory reset).  \- No visible hardware issues, phone had been working fine aside from Google Wallet suddenly no longer working maybe a week prior to the total crash.

"Android smart/dumb phone? Advice required  My mum (70) needs a new phone. Her previous one has finally bit the dust. I'm a bit of a Pixel fanboy so have an obvious bias and would buy her a GP9a without hesitation.  But...  Mum has mostly lost her sight. (-24)   I love that she has a phone with location sharing, it gives me the ability to find her if she gets turned around and lost. She loves our family chat group and the shared photos and also taking photos. But looking at the screen makes her eyes water constantly.   She could use chat on her Chromebook... She could use photos on her Chromebook but it won't help if she is away or put for the day and location tracking is important to us. (I don't want her to feel trapped by her eyesight) She loves a long dog walk but I need to be able to find her when she is lost.  Is there such a thing as a smart, dumb phone? Google maps access, Google chat,  maybe photos and a usable camera. But small screen, simple buttons. She can't see them without it making her eyes weepy. Maybe she would get the notification and use the Chromebook with a 21"" monitor for looking at it.  Just thoughts. A simple Google search didn't answer this exact use case. (Obviously) Wondered if anyone had tried anything....  Or... Do we all need to move to a different ecosystem so she can partake and not feel left out.",androidsever,1ker2rm
Frustrated w/ Galaxy S20 Connection Model is SM-G781U. I bought this phone from an online marketplace and everything works fine except that I can't connect to my network. I checked on my plan's signal map and my area's covered. Took out and reinserted the SIM card. Restarted the phone and its network settings probably a dozen times now. Turned Wi-fi on and off just the same. Etc. Nothing works with the connection. Last software update was in 2021 and nothing else seems to be available.

"Looking for Recommendations: Used Root-Friendly Smartphone under €200 (Germany/Europe) Hi everyone,  I've never used Reddit before, so I hope I'm posting in the right place...  I need some help choosing a used smartphone and just can't make up my mind. I know there are lots of similar posts, but after all my research, I'm actually more undecided than before.  I've been using Xperia phones for many years, always rooting them, but now my current one is bricked and the battery is dead. My budget is up to 200 euros, but I'm open to suggestions. What's most important to me is that the phone is root-friendly and has a large custom ROM community. That's why I almost decided on a Pixel, but then I read about OnePlus and now I'm not sure anymore...  It's possible that I won't root the phone right away (I'm a bit nervous about it!). With a Pixel, it's easy to de-Google with GrapheneOS, but what about OnePlus? Is the stock firmware full of bloatware or spyware? Or what about Poco devices?  One more thing: I used to have an Xperia Compact, so I don't need a huge display. Expandable storage and a headphone jack would be great, but I know that's rare these days. I also don't care about AI features-they don't seem very mature at the moment...  Do you have any model recommendations? And where would you buy a used device in Germany?

"Seeking a Samsung/Android Software Guru for a Quirky Wi-Fi Setting Issue (Galaxy S24 Ultra?) Hey r/AndroidQuestions or r/GalaxyS24Ultra (mods, please advise if a better subreddit exists!), I'm hoping to tap into the collective wisdom of this community and find someone who's deeply knowledgeable about Samsung and Android software intricacies. I've stumbled upon a rather unusual behavior on my (or potentially any Samsung?) device related to Wi-Fi settings, and I'm scratching my head trying to understand it. Specifically, I was looking at what seems to be a Wi-Fi air traffic capture setting area. Within this, there's a main ""Air log Capture"" toggle and then individual options for ""Management Frames,"" ""Data Frames,"" and ""Control Frames."" The weird part is, I noticed that my Wi-Fi was actively working (internet browsing, etc.) even when the main ""Air log Capture"" toggle was turned off, while the other frame-specific options were turned on. This seems counterintuitive, as I would expect the main capture to be necessary for any kind of monitoring or logging, and potentially even basic Wi-Fi functionality as well. I'm trying to understand:  * What exactly does the ""Air log Capture"" setting truly control on Samsung/Android devices?  * Is it possible for Wi-Fi to function normally with this setting off? If so, what might be the underlying mechanisms at play?  * Could the individual frame settings have a more direct impact on basic Wi-Fi connectivity than the main capture toggle in certain scenarios?  * Is this a known behavior or potential anomaly on Samsung devices, particularly the S24 Ultra or newer Android versions? I've already done some digging, but haven't found any clear explanations for this specific behavior. I'm hoping to connect with someone who has a deep understanding of Samsung's software customizations and how Android handles Wi-Fi at a lower level. If you're a Samsung/Android software whiz or have encountered anything similar, I'd be incredibly grateful for any insights you could offer! Even pointing me towards relevant documentation or resources would be a huge help.

"Should I reinstall all my apps to free space? Greetings. I possess an Infinix Smart 8 phone with Android 13 Go edition and XOS. Lately, I've been looking for ways to both automatize my every day tasks and install games for whenever I need to unwind, all of this without over bloating my storage space OR consuming a lot of phone data (generally I achieve this by using only Wi-Fi, but due to work that's not always possible).  The inbuilt storage cleaning tools offer me the option to ""reinstall"" any app. I've heard before that certain games save a lot of useless data (old game events and animations that won't ever be used again), and that uninstalling and reinstalling them can greatly reduce their app size, so I assume it's the same principle.  What I don't understand is how this differs from simply clearing cache and app data, to the point that my phone presents it as an entirely different option.  Is there a difference between clearing app data and reinstalling in regards to the amount of free space I regain? And if so, do all apps do this thing of keeping useless data that cannot be ereased thru just clearing app data? Or it's just games that do it? Should I reinstall all my apps, only specific ones, or neither of them?  I'm asking because I really want to free space, but I don't want to uninstall too many apps.

"Which midrange Samsung/Pixel phones have the most natural-looking photos and are compatible with Tracfone/eSIM? US user, budget around $200 to $400, asking while I'm individually researching models. I would like a phone that utilizes eSIM for Japan travel, and that has a camera with the most natural-looking \[naked eye\] colors without any unavoidable auto-optimization changing. No over-saturation. Having a bonus slot for a MicroSD card would be nice, if possible.  Upgrading from S7, so battery, CPU, RAM, and such will all essentially be outclassed by modern midrange specs. No need for flagships at this point for me, though I can afford lower-priced flagships on resell sites. What matters most to me now is eSIM ability and camera quality, though I think pretty much all modern phones use eSIMs. I think they all have 4K and 50 MP for rear lens, so color accuracy's the main focus with cameras.  * Samsung A55 * Samsung A54 * Samsung A35 * Samsung A36 * Pixel 6 and up, I'd rather not get the smaller ""a' sizes.  I read that Pixel cameras have a continuous HDR processor that cannot be turned off, therefore the colors may not be accurate to life. I also sincerely do not care for AI on photos, I think it just makes it look fake. Ideally, AI should be optional features, not something that's built in and cannot be switched off.  Also gonna transfer my prepaid Tracfone service to the new phone, so if anyone knows if these are compatible with Tracfone SIMs, that'd be nice. Will ask others regarding this.  I prefer focusing on Samsung and Pixels, heard Chinese models like Honor and Xiaomi have excellent cameras, but avoiding for potentially lower resale value, and I'm more used to Samsung. Also, I have no idea if these other brands are compatible with the Tracfone service, so I feel safer with brands Tracfone sells on their site like Samsung and Pixel.",androidsever,1kcpxc7

"I can control my collegue's music from my phone I work in a small business and sometimes my colleague likes to listen to music on a small speaker he has in his office. While this doesn't bother me at all (our respective offices are far enough that I don't hear the music), I see his device on my phone and I could actually control his music if I wanted to.   I checked the bluetooth pairing but the speaker isn't there, so I cannot unpair it from there. But, I noticed that the pairing disappear if I turn off the wifi from my phone, so I'm assuming that's the way it got connected in the first place.   So my question is : is there a way to disconnect my phone from the speaker ? It's not a big issue, but I'm kind of wondering why it's happening.

"Total file system failure on Redmi 10C **P.S.** Formatting this like a tech support request for easier understanding. I suspect my SD card somehow corrupted my phone's entire file system. Anyone has any advice/ideas? Or maybe a link to any similar case?  **Overview:** I\`m experiencing a total failure of file system on my Redmi 10C phone, MIUI global 14.0.10.  **What's wrong**: 64.0/64.0 gb occupied, 0.0B available. File manager displays all folders as empty. Connecting to pc via USB - empty directory. Gallery - everything is ""File Format isn't supported or files are corrupted"". Other apps don't have access to file system anymore.  **Additional information:** I have a kingston 64gb canvas gol plus SD card in this phone, 1 year old. Book readers can open books that they have saved. SMS messages are received and saved normally.  **What I've tried:**  1. **Downloading apps**. No space available error. 2. **Deleting apps.** Apps deleted, no result. 3. **Uploading files** (google drive, discord, telegram). Failed to access file. 4. **Uploading files to PC**. No files detected. 5. **Dumping all files with adb.** Three directories: 0, storage/emulated/0, storage/self. All empty. 6. **Reloading phone without SD-card.** No result. 7. **Turning phone off without SD-card,  booting up hour later.** No result. 8. **Using Mi Assistant.** Most interface buttons are unresponsive. Only function available is factory reset.  **Possible solutions (and reasons why i\`m hesitant to try them):**  1. **Factory reset.** I\`m scared to try it. Because, with all the apps working, my phone is in usable (albeit inconvenient) state right now. If all apps are deleted, and file system is corrupted - it's essentially a brick. 2. **Putting SD card into different device**. If SD-card is indeed the culprit, it could brick that device too. Though i can circumvent it by buying an sd card reader for my PC.  **Goals (ordered by importance):**  1. Get the phone into working condition. (don't wanna buy a new one). 2. Recover data from SD card. 3. Recover data from phone. (realistically, not happening)",androidsever,1kalpc0

"WiFi stops working or finding networks until reboot Reposting with the tablet model and a bit more information — I bought a ZZB Q2S, a cheap, generic Android tablet, as a smart home control center: Android 14 (after updates), 4GB RAM, 32GB storage, quad-core. It stays plugged in and on but with the screen off almost all the time. After the first week or two, the WiFi suddenly stopped working: still on, but status bar wifi icon dark and not seeing any networks. Not fixed by toggling wifi, the ""fix connectivity"" button in WiFi settings, or resetting WiFi and Bluetooth settings in Device Settings. Rebooting fixes it for a few hours to a few days, but it inevitably happens again; clearing the cache partition made the fix last longer but it still eventually stopped. This happens even when I use Tasker to ping my phone every 30 minutes as a heartbeat, so it's not from the network going idle. I replaced that tablet with another Q2S and it happened with that one, too.  Other than installing apps and typical settings, these are the only ""advanced"" things I've done:  - Developer options to turn off animations and set _Show background ANRs_ to On, _Suspended execution for cached apps_ to Disabled, and _Disable child process restrictions_ to On.  - Disabled several built-in apps: Calculator, Calendar, Contacts, Find My Device, Gallery, Gmail, Google Assistant, Google Go, Google Play Games (not Google Play Services), Google TV, Kids Space, Maps, Meet, Personal Safety, Sound Recorder, YouTube, YouTube Music.  - Set some apps to Unrestricted battery, primarily Tasker and its plug-ins (for smart home logic) and AnyDesk (for remoting into the tablet).  - Used wireless adb to give Tasker several permissions it needs, give AnyDesk PROJECT_MEDIA permission, and disable Doze with `shell dumpsys deviceidle disable`.  Has anyone seen something like this and know a fix? I'm hoping to not have to run the tablet in safe mode for days waiting for a repro, since there's no sure way to trigger the issue immediately. And while it's discouraging that it happened on two tablets, since they were identical I haven't completely written off the ""cheap faulty device"" possibility.",androidsever,1k9xw50
"[Pixel 6] Problem with Google Messages Hey gang!  So my wife has been having an issue with her Fi-based Pixel 6 as of yesterday maybe mid-morning; Google Messages doesn't work. She can load into the app itself, but selecting any conversations results in a blank screen, and tapping on a contact in the Contacts app to message directly brings the same thing. I've had her restart her phone, clear the Messages cache, turn off and on her WiFi as well as turning on and off Airplane Mode, and we've checked the Play Store for updates; none of these solved her issue. I had her download Textra to see if that would let her message people, and that seems to work perfectly fine, so we know it isn't an issue with the phone itself, and when we were in the car yesterday afternoon, her phone shut off completely and wouldn't turn back on until I booted it in recovery mode, which also didn't fix the issue.  Has anyone had any experience with this and/or may know of a way to solve it? Did Google push an update for the newer phones that somehow donked up the older ones?  Thank you!!

"Google Pixel C battery replacement cost? Title is self explanatory.  My aging Pixel C table (remember those?!) has recently got quite a large battery bulge, bad enough that the screen is separating from the frame by like 1cm or so.  I saw a repair kit on ifixit, and while my tech literacy is above average (I work in IT), my experience with swapping batteries is minimal at best and I'd rather not sink money into something I could very easily fuck up.  Ubreakifix does not even have the Pixel C listed as device to select, and using the dubious ""Other"" option does not instill confidence. The closest store to me is in a wealthy college town and is likely run by college kids who mostly see the newest iPhones and Pixels, not an obscure 7 year old Android tablet.  Granted, my Pixel C did not get much use. It mainly resided in the kitchen on a dock where it was occaisionally used for Spotify, recipes, and smart home control, all of which I can very easily do with other devices on my network, so I'm not exactly missing it that much.

If it is relevant, I am currently abroad in another country. However, I do not think that this is the problem - I have been downloading apps in this country for weeks.

When I try to download apps, I get stuck in the ""pending"" stage and it eventually just stops trying. When I try to update the play store, absolutely nothing happens.  I contacted Google support. They told me that it was probably just due to my account being in the wrong country and they couldn't do anything about it.

"I just switched from iOS to Android (HyperOS) after close to 10 years and I might need some help getting started So my iPhone 12 has really poor battery life and I figured I'll try android after close to ten years of iOS. I wanted a simple phone that does basic texting and has decent hardware. I chose the Xiaomi 15t pro because I tried it in store and it seemed like a great value. Originally wanted the normal 15 but was kinda tricked by the salesperson.   The hardware is amazing tough. Super fast charging, screen is great, the camera is amazing but it's the software that gives me headache. If I can somehow solve this I would be really happy with it. Here are my problems:  - Text prediction as a bilingual speaker is absolutely atrocious on every keyboard I tried. Random capitalizations and it switches languages mid sentence. I am currently writing this on my old iPhone because it's just so much quicker. Is there and keyboard that comes close to the iOS text prediction? I would even pay money for it.  - Most times I use a fullscreen / landscape apps I need to restart my whole phone to get out. I use the Apple inspired gesture control and when I swipe up it flickers but won't actually minimize the app. Sometimes it randomly begins to launch picture-in-picture apps.  - Almost every time I want to turn off the screen Gemini gets activated because it registers as a long press. I don't want any AI forced down my throat. Is there any way to completely disable this?  - Because I still have my old iPhone I notice that notifications get shown much faster on it. Sometimes it takes minutes to show up on the Xiaomi. Sometimes I have to manually start the app for it to show new messages for example.  - Every time I switch apps the first app will get unloaded from ram and completely restart when I get back. Even if it was just googling something for 5 seconds. I never had this occur once on the iPhone which has a third of the RAM.  I don't wanna hate on android, I really want to give it a fair shot but it's borderline unusable for my use case. I would be incredibly thankful for any tip I can get. Thanks!

"Comparing SDR, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision on Xiaomi Pad 6 – Why Are HDR Versions So Dim and Washed Out? Hey everyone,  I’ve been testing HDR content on my Xiaomi Pad 6, and I’ve noticed some interesting things while comparing SDR, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision. I wanted to share my experience and hear your thoughts on a few issues I’ve encountered. I’ve had similar experiences with HDR on my LG CX OLED as well, so I’m wondering if this is just how HDR is implemented or if it’s something else.  SDR (Standard Dynamic Range):  SDR has much better brightness compared to HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. It doesn’t look dim at all, and the brightness feels natural and sharp. The colors are balanced, and overall, it provides a more comfortable viewing experience compared to the HDR formats.  HDR10+ and Dolby Vision:  HDR10+ and Dolby Vision are supposed to enhance brightness, color, and contrast, but on the Xiaomi Pad 6, both of these look surprisingly dim, especially in comparison to SDR.  Dolby Vision in particular appears washed out, with colors lacking vibrancy and saturation. I was expecting much richer colors, but it seems flat and dull. Even HDR10+ feels less bright than I imagined.  A Few Questions I Have:  Why are HDR10+ and Dolby Vision versions so dim? I thought HDR content was supposed to have better brightness and contrast.  Is Dolby Vision really a useful feature to have? The feature is hyped up as this premium viewing experience, but when compared to SDR I don’t really see the benefit.  Streaming Issues:  Also you can’t turn Dolby Vision or HDR10+ off if you don’t like it. This is pretty frustrating, as I’d prefer to stick with SDR in some cases, but the app forces HDR formats regardless of my preference.   Final Thoughts:  Honestly, I’m struggling to comprehend why HDR has become so popular and why it’s valued so highly as a premium feature. If it’s supposed to make content brighter and more vibrant, why does it often seem like it’s more of a dim, washed-out experience?",androidsever,1k957zi

"Pictures backup Hey there, I'm switching to a new phone but I've had some issues backing up pictures.  My previous phone says it has 15k pictures, and after the new phone automatically copied everything, it ended up with only 13k pictures.  So I decided to erase the 13k from new phone and copy the pictures manually from my older device. However, when browsing through the files from my computer I can only find 9k pictures, most of which (7k) are in a ""thumbnails"" folder so they're tiny pictures that seem to have been carried from older devices from many years ago.   Are there really 15k files at all? Where can I find them? What am I missing? Is there a tool or app I can use to fully copy this information to my new device?",androidsever,1k8l4fm

"Switched from iOS to Android – Google Maps No Longer Showing Traffic Without a Destination Hey everyone,   I recently made the switch from iOS to Android, and I've noticed something odd with Google Maps. On my iPhone, the app would automatically display traffic conditions on all roads, even when I hadn't entered a destination. As soon as I opened the app, I could see real-time traffic without having to do anything extra.  However, on Android, it seems different. Unless I actively set a destination, traffic information doesn't appear. Even when I zoom in on the map, I still don't see any traffic details like I used to.  Is there a setting or feature I need to enable to make Google Maps show traffic at all times, the way it did on iOS? I'd appreciate any advice or suggestions. Thanks in advance!",androidsever,1k85144

"Considering an upgrade to either a Samsung s25 Ultra or Xiaomi 15 Ultra from a Google Pixel 7 Pro - looking for opinions I'm looking for people's experiences with the Samsung S25 Ultra and Xiaomi 15 Ultra - especially if you upgraded from a Pixel 7 Pro.  I've been an android/Samsung fan since the SGH-E700 and my first smartphone was the S3. I stuck with Samsung until the S7 then moved to Huawei P30 Pro after around 5 years of the S7 due to the Samsung price point. I loved the Huawei too and would have got another in a heartbeat if they were still using Google software. After the Huawei/Google fallout, I moved to the Pixel 7 Pro.   I love the camera on my Pixel and the battery life is still good after just over 2 years, but the phone isn't without it's faults and I'm getting fed up of the signal dropping, random overheating/crashing and Google Photos continuously backing up despite me switching back up off multiple times 🙄. I thought moving to a phone where the hardware and software were both ran by Google would be a great experience but it's not really been noticable.   I've been reading up on the S25 Ultra and Xiaomi 15 Ultra and have seen mixed reviews - so looking for opinions from general users, especially if they switched from a Pixel (although I'm interested in hearing all opinions).   I use phones a lot - I love taking photos/videos and tend to store a lot on the phone. I am a moderate/heavy phone user and tend to run lots of different apps frequently, including social media, the odd game and multi-tasking.

"-""An error occurred while moving the file to the trash. No file was sent to the trash.""- Hello, I'm having trouble deleting a .pdf file downloaded from the internet from my phone, but I don't think the file is a virus.    Let me tell you a little bit about the story. A while ago, I found out by chance that I had a relative who fought for the US in World War II, and last Thursday the topic came up at a family dinner. My immediate family had never met this relative or his descendants; that's just how immigration works. My paternal great-grandson's family migrated here to Argentina. This relative migrated to the US, so we were unaware of his existence. His story caught our attention, so we turned to the internet. When I searched for information about this relative, I learned he served under Patton in France. Wanting to check the information, I went to the **U. S. 7th Armored Division Association** website ([ and downloaded some files where he was mentioned, part of a list of decorated soldiers.    Unfortunately, these PDFs didn't contain any other relevant information, so there was no point in keeping them in my phone's memory, so I deleted them. A few days later, I had to search for a file on Google Files, and then I discovered that one of those PDFs was still in the Downloads folder, titled ""N-7AD-GO-All.pdf."" I had no problems with the other files, but I can't delete this one. Every time I try, it says:  >*-""Se produjo un error al mover el archivo a la papelera. No se envió 1 archivo a la papelera""-*  >(*-""An error occurred while moving the file to the trash. One file was not sent to the trash.""-*)  I can't open it, move it, or rename it either; it's stuck there.  **What should I do?**",androidsever,1k61f7g

"Vivo V50 lite 5G What are your thoughts on the latest Vivo V50 lite 5G? It has a Mediatek Dimensity 6300 for a price of PHP 16,999 for 8/256 variant, while you can get Honor X9C with SD 6 gen 1 chipset for the same price, or Infinix GT20 pro with Dimensity 8200 ultimate for only 15,999.   Currently I have a Vivo Y11, which was purchased way back 2019, and I can still used it for basic phone activity, thats why I am still considering the Vivo V50 lite 5G as an upgrade even though it has lower chipset as compare to other brand with the same price range.   In addition to this, I also have a Realme C21y released on year 2020, with a chipset of Unisoc T610 which should be significant better with my Vivo Y11 chipset of SD 439, but based on my experience I still prefer the Vivo Y11 in terms of performance. This is the reason why I am still hesitant on purchasing phone on other new brands even though they have a higher chipset.

"Google Account Nightmare - Persistent Duplicate Device, Missing ""Trust This Device,"" and Useless Support - Need Help! Hey Reddit, I'm at my wit's end with a bizarre and incredibly frustrating Google Account issue and completely unhelpful support. I'm hoping someone here might have experienced something similar or have some insight.  **The Problem:**  I flashed my Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer twice recently. After each flash and subsequent Google Account login, I now have **two linked listings for the same phone** in my Google Account (""Mi Phone"" and ""Android device""). Renaming or unchecking one affects the other. The ""Android device"" listing doesn't respond to Find My Device but still shows as active.  The WORST part is that **my current phone is never recognized as a trusted device.** I NEVER get Google Prompts for 2-Step Verification, and the ""Trust this device"" option is completely missing during sign-in attempts, even on the phone itself when accessing sensitive Google settings.  **What I've Tried (Repeatedly):**  * Removed and re-added my Google account multiple times. * Factory reset my phone twice and set it up as new. * Cleared cache and data for Google Play Services, Play Store, and Framework. * Revoked access to both device listings from my Google Account on a computer. * Followed all the generic ""remove untrusted device"" steps from Google Support (which don't work because the duplicate is linked and unremovable).  **Google Support Experience:**  My experience with Google Support has been infuriating. Despite clearly explaining the linked duplicate issue and the missing ""Trust this device"" option, I've received nothing but generic troubleshooting steps for standard device management – the exact steps I've already told them are ineffective. They claim specialists have reviewed my case, but their advice shows a complete lack of understanding of the unique nature of my problem.  **What I Need Help With:**  * Has anyone ever encountered a **linked duplicate device listing** in their Google Account that they couldn't remove? * Does anyone know why the **""Trust this device"" option might be completely missing** during sign-in? * Are there any **non-standard methods or hidden settings** I might be able to try? * Has anyone had success escalating issues beyond the initial tier of Google Support? If so, how?  I'm desperate for a solution that actually addresses the root cause of this problem, which I strongly believe is a server-side issue with how my devices are registered with Google. The inability to trust my primary device is a significant security and usability concern.  Any advice, similar experiences, or potential solutions would be greatly appreciated!

Setup:  Bands: B71 + B66  B71 alone = 10–15 Mbps  With B66 CA = 40–45 Mbps total  B66 alone = 0 Mbps ( bot entirely sure how does B66 add speed if it's 0mbps but I'm not gonna question it)  B7 used to work great (slightly lower speeds but solid 6 Mbps upload), but hasn’t worked at all since a lightning storm — maybe hardware damage at the tower?   After a few minutes of light or no traffic, CA drops and I'm stuck on useless B66-only. It takes ~45 secs of activity (like loading a webpage) for CA to kick back in. My old Pixel 6 held CA fine under the same conditions.  No root, just looking for:  ADB or service mode tweaks to keep CA alive longer  Ways to prevent CA idle timeout  Lightweight keep-alive traffic tips   If anyone has dealt with this on Qualcomm X70 modems, I’d appreciate the help!",androidsever,1khvge9

"How to setup notification sounds for each app? Hi, I just switched from iPhone to Samsung. And I am experiencing some ""culture shock"".  My Samsung phone uses that one Samsung sound for most of the apps.... And it is driving me INSANE!  I can't be looking at the screen every time it makes a sound. I NEED to be able to know what app made the sound without looking at it.   For example, with iPhone, if I'm taking a nap, and if it makes an email sound, then I'll know I can safely ignore it and keep napping. But, if it is a sound from text message, then I'll know I need to check the message now!   But with Samsung it is weird. Some apps like WeChat and Ring have their own notification sounds. But apps like Email (Samsung email) and Google Message and other apps only use Samsung's sound.  I tried to go to the settings to adjust it, but my lord it is impossible, cuz it asks me to assign a sound for each functions of each app. Meaning if the app has 20 functions then I'll have to assign 20 sounds to that one app..... It is not doable.",androidsever,1kgf4do

"What is the best Android phone to buy in 2024? n your opinion, what is the best Android phone to get in the market today. I mean, one that just works, like the iPhone. The iPhone is not perfect, but for the most part, it works.  I'm thinking of switching to Android from the iPhone mainly due to one reason - USB-C. I do not have money for the iPhone 15 seeies, which means any other phone I get would have the lightning port, and considering how long I use phones for, this may mean I'd have the lightning port four years from now, and by then you can already tell how obsolete it will be. But there's always something wrong with the Android choices to consider.  The Samsung S23 has a wack camera (yes it does, no matter how much you Samsung stand claim to love it). The Google Pixel 8 has a weak chipset that makes every pixel 6-8 user feel like they are testing a product. OnePlus and the rest aren't available in some regions plus they have a design that feels cheap. The one other choose I'd have considered is the Rog phone from last year (the one MKBHD loved for being compact), but it is unavailable in my reign.  I think the best compromise I can make is to get the Pixel 8 and pair it with an iPad which I would use to do main work like gaminh and working with some apps, while using the pixel 8 more for chatting with friends and snapping pictures.

"What can you do on Android that you can’t do on iOS? Hey. I don't want to provoke sumthin. This is a genuine question from an ios guy.  Back then, when I was a kid, I used to use Android devices, specifically the Samsung Galaxy A series. When I switched to iPhones, there was a few things I missed: the widgets, the emulators, all these specific apps, the customisation: homescreen, Lock Screen, launchers, cool things like automations and focus modes and so on. But nowadays you have all these features on iOS with the smooth, fluid, pretty Apple design. The customisation, especially what you can do with the Apple Shortcuts-App is insane, I can also play Gran Turismo on the PPSSPP-Emulator on my iPhone... yeah, it's great. So I really feel like nowadays these two Operating Systems are very similar, it's just a preference of design.  So, because of that, I don't really understand the argument that ""Apple locks you in"" or ""forbids everything"", but maybe I unknowingly live in an from Apple controlled Propaganda-Simulation-OS... or sumthin, maybe there are great features on Android that I just don't know about.  A friend of mine, who has a Samsung Galaxy S-Sumthin, pointed out an app that he installed as an APK, which lets him use an enhanced version of YouTube without ads plus additional features like Picture-in-Picture-Mode - and that's so cool! I mean you can do the same thing on iOS via installing a PiP- and an Ad-Blocker-Extension on the App Store, but then you have to use YouTube via Safari.

I recently tried a cheap Android phone and honestly, I would NOT buy another Android phone ever if that's all there is to it!      I also understand some people won't bother buying an $800 or $1200 Android phone, if they already tried a $150 one and found it repulsive to use it.   Anyway, I'm just saying, the Android camp would have to do a whole lot more convincing if they ever want to win over people from the Apple crowd, I just think it's not enough what they are doing, the latest OS is just not as exciting even if it's on a fast phone.",androidsever,1f2xkgz

"Why doesn’t android have a mass cache deletion button?? I really just want to know, why haven’t they added that feature? Or is it only a feature in the newer phones? I’ve been using the moto g play for a year now(32gb), and all the sudden google play, Facebook, and google photos all amass a cache of over 700mb and I don’t understand cause I don’t even have to open the apps at all, it just happens even if they haven’t been touched for days.   So anyways, I play this game against my phone since I’m right under the last 3gb of storage, where it says that some system functions might not work. And I have to use a cache cleaner app(3rd party), and wait for it to do its thing. This happens every 2-3 days at this point, where I have to do a manual clean. But when u have about 3gb of storage left, cache issues like that might cause my phone to just self delete by blowing the cache on these apps way bigger than it needs to be. Why would the android techs & devs not have either just made cache deletion automatic, or put a button in for you to delete all cache? Sincerely I don’t understand how that can be overlooked for 10 years, is there a legitimate reason why doing that would be a bad thing?

I have a SM-G975F/DS (Samsung Galaxy S10+) and I recently updated the Playstore app and completely forgot to disable the auto-update feature. So my phone automatically updated the YouTube app even though I have been holding back on it. And now, my app looks a bit like the desktop version.

I'm not talking about the picture-in-picture mode though. I'm good with that.

That said, I understand that sometimes, people miss things. If I go to remove your post and it's just a simple little one time thing and I think, ""maybe they just missed the rules"", whatever.

If I or someone else tells/warns you about the rules, and then you still go and break a rule, that's when I decide it's time for some sort of ban depending on the exact situation. There are exceptions - if rulebreaking is egregious and blatant enough, sometimes, you just get a ban. That's really typically in a situation where it's like...come on, you should know better. Don't come in here spamming, don't wish hamrful things on other human beings, just don't do it.   Thank you to the people who are genuinely reporting posts or comments that they believe break rules.

Best Android Keyboard for Voice to Text Hi All  I need a good keyboard for a Samsung S22 which specifically has good recognition for voice to text.  I've tried the basic Samsung keyboard one and also switched to the Google voice recognition and they are both really poor. They don't get words correct or add punctuation and it's then a lot of extra work sorting the texts out.  I used to have an iPhone for work which I really hated but I can't deny that the voice to text recognition was much more reliable   Has anyone got any recommendations?  Thank you very much!,androidsever,1ci7wyl

"Remove language switch button from navbar? The December update for Android 15 brought a bunch of new bugs and glitches. And even unnecessary features...  Whether you use the old 3-button navigation bar or the swipe navigation bar, there will be a new globe button on the right side. This button is a system feature and unrelated to the number of languages or keyboards or other input methods. It simply circles through all of them.  Whenever the keyboard or other input is enabled - like for example when you focus on some input field like a text file or the chat in a messenger etc - this new globe button will be shown. But this makes navigation during input very messy as you might accidentally touch that button. And it's even worse when you have to use swipes instead of tapping. With fat fingers even tapping will be challenging from now on. It's a nightmare of a design decision.  Last time they did everything for ""fat fingers"" but now it's kind of ridiculing those design decisions or policies.  If at least there was an option to remove that button! Sadly there is no way to do so as of now.  Btw, all Pixel devices seem to be affected.  ---  Btw. One of the most annoying bugs is when I'm in landscape mode, do some voice recording and try to switch to another app. For some reason the animation gets stuck and I need to switch back and forth a few times until I actually can display the other app...

"(NO EXPLICIT CONTENT!!) I need to block every possible p*rn content on my son's phone Hello, I marked this as NSFW, I hope this is enough (and new account because I don't want the people I know to read this on my main account!).

As his parent, I have the duty to help him.  His phone is a Motorola moto g84.  What we would like is a software/something, (I'm really not a software guy myself...) that somehow controls everything he can search for on any browser, and block, without possibility to somehow access it, p\*rn contents. For instance, he tried to always impose ""safe search"", but it's very easy to overcome it and it's not enough anymore. It goes without saying that he must not be able to turn this off, otherwise it would be useless!  With  p\*rn contents I mean videos, websites, and also the possibility to see  p\*rn pictures on the ""images"" section on google.  I saw that there are many possibilities, like parental control, third party apps (though we've tried one and it was bad at best...) etcetera, but I do not know if it will be a definitive solution to the problem.  Could you please help us ?  P.S He told me there are other ways to access p\*rn, like Reddit and Telegram, but he has already used other apps to lock them behind a password, so browsers are the last thing to protect him from.  P.S2 many will say ""this is not a solution"" and I know it, indeed he'll start seeing a doctor for this. It's not a severe addiction, he uses it like once every week/two weeks and he has managed to stop for almost one year, but due to a very hard period he started again.

"Please help me pick a phone. **My dilemma.**  To start. I own a Samsung S9+ and it's be having issues recently. Poor call quality, poor battery etc. I'd really like to upgrade but phones are expensive so if I can help it I'd love to upgrade but not spend a ton (I'm willing to though if I have to). My girlfriend and her brother are against me getting a Samsung they'd much rather me get an iPhone so I'm prepared to cop a lot of shit with whatever my decision may be (Unless it's an iPhone) but I'll live. They're not the ones who have to use it. I have access to a private Samsung store at work which gives me a little bit of a discount so I'm more leaning towards Samsung but that's why I'm here, to make sure that's the right decision. The two I'm up in arms about are the S24 Ultra and the S24+ (Possibly the S23 Ultra as well).      **S24 Ultra**  I'd really love an ultra but at 1.7K for the 512gb variant I really really don't want to push the button on it cause my savings isn't incredible and it would definitely feel the difference (I am 19 and live at home so if I did spend the money I wouldn't be fucked fucked but still). It seems really big and bulky also.      **S24 +**  The S24+ though I can get the 512gb version at 1.2k - 1.4k (I forgot) but it's the exynos version which I hear nothing good about. I don't game really game on my phone a whole lot so I don't know if that'll make a difference but good battery life and a good camera is all I truly want.      **S23 Ultra**  I'm able to get this one for roughly 1.5k (kind of in-between the S24+ price range and the S24 Ultra price range) but it has to be the 256gb version and only 8gb ram and also has to be in black. Is it worth getting this despite the 8gb version being the only one available?       If there is another phone you'd recommend please let me know below or if these three phones are everything a phone can be nowadays for general day use then which one would you decide on? I live in Australia by the way so some phones might be harder to get then others but I'll definitely let you know if the one you recommend is difficult for me to get or not.

"Android phone models least likely to get a green line I know this question has been asked to death, but here goes nothing.   I have an Samsung S21 FE, got a green line.

I also largely prefer Samsung's implementation of the Secure Folder. Alternatively, I may consider downloading GrapheneOS on a Pixel.

Assuming I don't drop my phone (which apparently is another cause of the green line), do I stand a better chance if I get an S series that is not S20 / S21 (e.g. S23)? Or perhaps an A-series like the new A55? I don't need the most flagship, and the A series seems like a good compromise.

"Your take on 7 deadly sins of smartphone? Sounds like a good challenge so let me add.  1. **Megapixel overload** - While this may not sound bad on paper, the overprocessed photos still holds 200mp claims back. 2. **Jackless** - Nowadays, smartphones today have no headphone jack. You still get Sony Xperia or budget phone though. Though using USB-C to 3.5mm DAC can offer better audio quality, but the stress between USB-C port and a dongle is might be an issue. 3. **Fake proximity** - With smartphones going bezelless, smartphone giants have added virtual proximity sensor to budget smartphones using software. The problem is that the accuracy of virtual proximity sensor is inferior to a real proximity sensor. Avoid any smartphones with this sensor if you need to call. 4. **Simless (Literally)** - Removing SIM card slot in favor of eSIM shows how you'd be getting your phone robbed or lost. This is only present in the US version of iPhone 14 and onwards. 5. **Tiny macro quality** - 2mp macro lens is a useless junk that you'd be better off installing a dedicated macro camera lens on your main camera. 6. **Shady company** - When such companies like Freedom Phone (India and US respectively) had its long history of not promising any important and scamming consumers, they could be considered shady. 7. **False marketing** - Same fate as the **Shady company** list but they don't promise features that didn't happen or are half-baked.

My team and I have been developing an app for the last three years. We've poured countless hours into this project, putting our blood, sweat, and tears into making it something we're really proud of. Our app was finally released on Google Play and we started to have some momentum and traction. Then, out of nowhere, we received a notification that our **Google Play developer account was terminated** due to *""prior violations of the Developer Program Policies and Developer Distribution Agreement by this or associated, previously terminated Google Play Developer accounts"".* Keep in mind that we DID NOT receive any prior notice, no clear explanation, didn't have any previous Google Play account, and our appeal was quickly rejected with a generic response that didn't clarify the issue at all. We've been left in the dark, scrambling to understand what went wrong, and, more importantly, how to fix it. This has been a devastating blow, both professionally and personally, for our team.  We've tried reaching out to Google Play support, but it seems like we're hitting a wall. The responses are vague and unhelpful, and we haven't been given a clear path to resolve the situation. **Our app is now unavailable to users, and we're losing out on potential growth and revenue every day**.  We're not planning to back down from this. **We believe in our app and the value it offers to users and received lots of positive feedback from the community, and we want to fight this termination. However, we're not sure what our next steps should be.** **We are seriously considering legal action but are unsure of the best way to proceed.**  Has anyone here experienced something similar? How did you handle it? We're particularly interested in hearing from those who've taken legal action or sought legal advice in situations like this. We made sure to read thoroughly Google Play's rules, policies, agreements to comply with them, have privacy policy and terms and conditions handcrafted by lawyers.  Any recommendations for legal resources, particularly those with experience in digital rights and app store disputes? Also, does anyone have tips on how to navigate this process or how to get Google's attention more effectively? We're determined to find a resolution and would greatly appreciate any advice or insight from this community.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and for any help you can offer. We're hoping to get our app back on track and continue providing value to our users.  **TL;DR:** Google Play terminated our developer account without notice or clear explanation. Our appeal was denied, and we don't know why. We're considering legal action and need advice. How to proceed ?",androidsever,1enuxea

"How to turn off screen time data for specific apps? I've recently gotten an android phone and I'm wondering if there's a way to disable the section in settings that shows how much time you've spent looking at a certain app. The reason for this is that I live with a very controlling relative who has a habit of going through my phone, and if she comes across this section and finds out that I've been spending significant amounts of time on xyz app, she'll start snooping through it more regularly to see what I'm doing and that would be a serious problem for me.  Is there any way to disable this or at least exclude certain apps from this screen? Please advise! Unfortunately, just changing my password isn't an option right now in this case.

"One specific MP3 file download kept getting corrupted on Android Phone [SOLVED] Posting this because this took me FOREVER to figure out. And I'm sure others will be perplexed by this issue and will search for a solution.  So I have a workflow where I download my audiobooks as .aax files, then convert those into MP3 files. I then uploaded those MP3 files to my Google Drive, and I then downloaded those MP3 files onto my Android phone so I can listen to the audiobooks directly via my phone even with shit cellphone connections.  I had a recurring issue with ONE PARTICULAR audiobook where, for some reason, the Android download keep getting corrupted. And even after downloading it, it wouldn't show up in the audio section, and wasn't playable as an audio file. It would just show up as ""downloadfile"" in the Device Storage > Download file.  Finally as a PURE GUESS after trying a bunch of shit, I tried shortening the file name, since I noticed this audiobook had an exceptionally long title. Turns out, that was the fix. I THINK that Android has some kind of hard filename character limit that causes audio downloads to get corrupted. The fix was simply to shorten the filename, and now the download worked as normal and the audio file is playable.  This took me FOREVER to figure out, so I wanted to post it here for anyone Googling this issue who unable to find a fix.  Thanks!",androidsever,1diwyhi

"I need a good phone, a very good phone So, I had Xiaomi 12 and it was quite inadequate. For a few months now, I'm using Samsung s24, which is slightly better but still a great disappointment.   I'm constantly using Google Maps with or without Android Auto, Calimoto (Ride recording/Navigation for Motorbike), Polarsteps on weekends or holidays, basic messaging apps, music apps, Google Wallet, Google Translate, chatgpt, gmail and one or two connected bluetooth devices. In car it's always on fast cable charger, on motorcycle wireless charging.  I don't play games, I'm not mining Bitcoin or running a server.  The phone gets already really hot in a perfectly normal usage but especially in car or motorcycle, mobile data keeps disconnecting although it seems connected, auto rotate keeps lagging, sometimes things work somehow slow or irrational. And although charging, battery keeps draining.  Even in a normal work day, without any of these apps, my battery life is worse than Xiaomi 12 but I can charge and it's OK. But considering that I have to withstand this nonsense inadequacy and handicapped piece of device, I can't stop but think that the Lord could at least endow me with a good battery life, but apparently, that's a no.   Anyway, I want a good, fast and reliable phone. I want a good processing capacity that can manage heavy loads without getting so hot/overwhelmed.

"Streaming apps black screen with audio only EDIT: SOLVED! It was the Motorola 'Nightlight' feature that was responsible. Seems certain apps don't play nice with it.   Original post:  Hello, I'm new here, and I'm at a loss with this problem! It's a really weird one. I hope sometime can help (it's my fiancée's phone!)  The phone is a Moto G13 and it is running Android version 14. The system version is UHAS34.29-3 and is the newest version as of 9th September - long before this issue appeared.   Netflix and Disney+ apps only display a blank, black screen when trying to play a video. Only the audio plays. Even subtitles appear, if selected! But no video.   This only started recently. Last Sunday, Netflix was working fine! Disney wasn't installed at that time, having only been installed this evening.  Because this is happening with both Netflix AND Disney, I don't think it can be a problem with just the one app.  Videos still play normally in Firefox browser and in the YouTube app. Tiktok and Facebook apps can also play still videos normally. so I don't think it can be an issue with all apps, or video playback.  Both apps have been uninstalled and reinstalled. Both apps have had all data/cache cleared. The phone is fully updated and has been restarted. And all combinations of these things have been done ad nauseum!  The colour correction option in android accessibility menu is turned off. (A suggestion from some websites).  This problem happens regardless of being on wi-fi or mobile data.  No settings had been changed recently, as she doesn't tend to mess with settings.

So he let me activate it, but then since he doesn't use data a lot and turns it off, he asked if he can still send RCS messages without data, I said no but it will fall back onto MMS/SMS, but we tested it and it didn't because I forgot about turning on the ""Auto resend as MMS/SMS"" toggle.

"Any way to permanently disable _requests_ from apps to enable notifications? Every app I download asks me if I will grant notification permissions so they can increase engagement by spamming me with messages I don't want or care about.

My question: is there anything that can be done to tell an app (or better yet, all apps) ""No, no notifications from you, and never ask me again?"", preventing _in-app_ requests to enable notifications?  I'm hoping that these requests are using some common Android API that I could somehow disable, thus preventing any application anywhere from ever requesting notification permissions. So maybe I can disable it at the OS level, or download some app that intercepts requests? I'm happy to root my device and run a custom OS like LineageOS if that would make this possible.

"Is 512GB of storage overkill for a heavy user that doesn't game? I'm looking to get a OnePlus Nord 4. I currently have a Samsung A52 with 128GB of storage which is almost full (plus some more on an SD Card), but I'm unsure whether to get 256GB or 512GB on my next phone. My photos are backed to OneDrive, but I do keep them on the device, with OneDrive also being nearly full.  3 years of photos on the A52 have taken around 30GB, in addition to around 60GB of apps. The SD card has an additional 40GB but is mostly old photos from my Xperia which had little internal storage (not a situation I want to return to.)  I'm quite a heavy user but don't really game     Is 512GB worth it on a phone at all? Cost is £45 more.

"Confused About SD Maid's Paid Features - Did I Accidentally Subscribe? I installed SD Maid from F-Droid and granted it all necessary permissions before starting a full scan. After the scan, I was able to clean a small amount of trash (a few kilobytes) from the first two sections. However, I was unable to clean the trash in the third section (the AppCleaner section), which contained over 1 GB of trash.  Initially, AppCleaner and some other features were locked, but I somehow managed to unlock them without understanding how. The app prompted me to pay or subscribe (I can't remember the exact terms) to access these paid features. Curiously, I clicked a button (I am not sure if it was labeled 'Pay', 'Patreon', 'Sponsor', or 'Subscribe') just to see what would happen. I was prepared to instantly refuse if asked to confirm any payments or subscriptions.  After clicking, I was redirected to a page that I immediately closed, suspecting it was just an ad or a subscription page. Surprisingly, after this, all the paid features became unlocked. I'm really surprised and now worried—did I unintentionally agree to a subscription when I clicked the button, thus unlocking all the features?  I downloaded the app from this link:   Can anyone clarify what might have happened? I’m concerned about unintended charges. Thanks!.",androidsever,1ec4szm

"Audio Equalizers not working properly on Android 15 Ever since installing Android 15 (and as observed on multiple phones - Pixel 7 and 9 Pro), none of my audio equalizers work the way they used to on Android 14. I enjoy bass boosting my headphones quite a bit (20db+) and it seems Android is limiting the volume quite heavily now. On some equalizers (Flat Equalizer, PowerAmp, Wavelet), the other frequencies duck when there's a bass hit, then go back up right after. Like how you would expect a limiter to work. Some equalizers (in the Sony app, Android's build-in SoundFX) simply distort the bass frequencies and crunch everything. I'm going to explain this poorly, but on Android 14 the boosted frequencies would occupy the available space in the volume slider until it hit the top, and only then would the system limiter kick in. Now it seems like the volume slider itself is a hard limiter and nothing can go past it. Is this something to do with the Loudness API that was introduced in 15? Are there any settings I can change or any equalizers that get past this issue? Or is this just a Pixel issue? I want my bass back!!!  If it's helpful, I listen on Spotify with a pair of Sony XM4s.

"Why is it so hard (or impossible) to upgrade to a newer major Android version? Could some kind soul please explain to me why it is so hard to get a newer major version of Android onto an old device? (Please note that this post is about really old devices, I don't know the situation of newer ones.)  I have several devices (mostly tablets) stuck on 5.1 or 4.something, and there seems to rarely ever be a path from e.g. Android 5 to Android 6 or 7. Even inofficial ROMs usually seem to be stuck at the same major version.   I'm not an Android expert, and have largely only used Windows for a long time. Windows doesn't suffer from this problem, as you can usually just slap a newer Windows version onto your computer (apart from the occasional hardware requirements block, or a real architectural change like a new driver model, both of which doesn't happen too often).  What especially confuses me is that Linux (which Android is based on) usually runs on pretty much anything (if the CPU architecture matches), but not on arbitrary Android devices.  The main reason for me to ask this question is that I have quite a few old Amazon Fire tablet and Fire TV devices that would still be perfectly usable, but I want to move beyond Android 5.1. All I can find e.g. for a Fire TV (2nd gen) box running Fire OS 5 (= Android 5.1) is a (barely functional, AFAICT) LineageOS ROM that is also based on Android 5.1.

And now that RCS is supported on iPhone my main holdup is totally gone. Are there any former iPhone users here that could tell me what they missed the most, if anything about iPhone? What are some of your favorite little random Android features that are super cool?",androidsever,1fp54wy

"Can I rename my Android devices that appear on my Google account? I'm speaking of the device list that appears in the Google account security settings on the web (and presumably in the corresponding menus on the phone).  The one that can be located at this URL:     The reson I want to rename them is because I want to avoid a situation where my devices list looks like this:  * Galaxy S7 * Galaxy S7 * Galaxy S7  I would rather want to see  something like this:  * Galaxy S7 Black * Galaxy S7 Gold * Galaxy S7 White  I simply want to be able to distinguish them easily in that list of authorized devices with access to my account, should I ever need to kick them out of there. I wouldn't want to kick the wrong one.  Is this possible? Maybe by changing the device name in system settings on the phone itself?

"Youtube links play in Messages rather than opening YT app I just upgraded from the Pixel 7 to the Pixel 9. On my old phone, if I clicked a YT link in Messages, Reddit or other apps, it would open up the Youtube app and play there, allowing me to minimize that window or switch back to Messages (or any other app) and keep YT playing in the background.  Now on my Pixel 9, if I click that same link it opens some version of YT WITHIN Messages. So if I want to then go back to Messages, I have to click the back button 2-3 times to get back to the normal Messages window, which closes the YT player within Messages and stops the video.  I'm sure this is a setting I'm missing somewhere but I can't actually figure out what it is.",androidsever,1f45828

"Apps closing after clicking on links. As of posing this message, about 30 minutes ago my phone has decided to be very annoying. I have a Note 10 plus, and for whatever reason, when I tap on a link in an app that would take me to a website, like etsy or makeship, my phone closes that app after I hit ""Open in Samsung internet"" and return to it.  Here's an example: I was on reddit and I tapped a link in someone's bio to check out their etsy page. Once I tapped on the link, it took to me to a sort of in-app browser (that I wish I could get rid off) like usual. I tapped the ""More options"" triple dots in the top right and selected ""open in Samsung internet"" which was and is my default browser. I window shopped for a bit then tried to go back to reddit, but when I closed the in-app browser reddit closed as well. This kept happening for every link I tapped.  This has only just started happening and I've had my phone for four years. I have no clue what could wrong, *if* there even is something wrong.

"Asus Zenfone 10 vs Samsung Galaxy S23 vs Pixel 8a I know this has probably been asked and answered a lot but I would appreciate your views anyway on which one to buy. All three phones will cost me about the same after all the things like case and charger are accounted for (Z10 gets everything in the box)  My main priorities are:  1. Battery life: I'm not a heavy user at all but am often in poor network areas, so having a phone that lasts more than one day will be good. I don't want to plug in the phone every night. 2. Build and hardware quality: I'm not talking about looks here but whether the phone will last. For reference, I have been punishing my current Lenovo P2 for 6 years. 3. Multitasking capability: When comparing performance, simultaneous multi-app performance is more important to me. I don't play games on my phone so that is not a concern. 4. Software: This is the main concern I have when it comes to Z10. Not being able to update the Android version is causing me real troubles with my current phone and I fear that will be the bottleneck even sooner in the future. I don't know how long the support for Android 15 (from apps and stuff) will last.  I currently use stock Android but can also live with OneUI (hopefully). Not sure about how large the difference is between them, but I probably won't end up using all the features of either. ZenUI seems neater to me in video reviews but I don't know about that.  I don't really care too much about the camera since I am happy clicking pictures even with my current lowly 5MP sensor (singular-imagine that!). Of course I'll take the best I can get but this is the lowest priority for me. I truly do not understand why phones are being designed around cameras nowadays.  I really like the form factor of the Zenfone but I've used a Samsung phone in the past and found that to be good as well and got good support from them. The poor reviews about support from Asus make me hesitate. Help me decide here.",androidsever,1dzhxyh

"Samsung A25 Mobile Data refuses to connect, despite having full service bars Hi all. Around 6 months ago, I upgraded from a Motorola G7 to a Samsung a25 5g. It worked well until about a month or so ago. It refuses to keep a consistent connection when I'm trying to use data. Wifi works fine. Everything else works fine, but it's just my mobile data. It keeps jumping between E, crossed out, LTE+, 5G and 5GUC without me moving anywhere or messing with any of the settings. It'll often get stuck specifically on LTE+ with the upwards pointing arrow full but the downwards arrow empty, then it'll go back to jumping between all the aforementioned. All the while, the bars next to it are completely full. My sister has an A15. She bought it on the same day I got mine, uses her old SIM card and she's having no issues. My dad has a Samsung as well and its 100% fine for him. I even put my sim card back into my old moto g7 and it worked perfectly.  I've done all the troubleshooting on both Samsung's website and T-Mobile's (my internet service  provider) and still no luck. Last week I went to our local T-Mobile store and was given a new (apparently upgraded) SIM card to replace my old one. My phone worked for around thirty minutes before going back to how it was before.  Today, I updated my phone to Samsung's One U.I 6.1 and restarted it.

"Google invents teleporting OR location services are AFU Location services has a problem if one lives on a hill -- at various times, my phone connects to cell towers miles away in the flatlands and location services ""teleports"" me to those locations, causing all kinds of problems (like turning on cameras that are supposed to be off when I'm at home).  (I've seen the blue dot in maps move to places that are over 5 miles away, and frequently to one of a couple of locations, hence my suspicion re cell towers.)  There's a simple fix for this: location services needs to consider that when a location which has been stable for many minutes suddenly changes to a point miles away, that is not evidence of the invention of teleportation, but is just incorrect cell tower info.  One would think WiFi connectivity info should always override when cell location changes significantly but WiFi connectivity stays the same, but that is apparently beyond Google's capability to implement.  I've sent feedback many times regarding that solution as this problem occurs even when I'm on my Nest WiFi which is at my Home with a known location.

"Upgrading from Note 20 Ultra- Do I go S24U or wait for S25U Hi all, Hoping someone knowledgeable could provide advice. I have had the Note 20 ultra for almost 5 years now and I've loved the hell out of it. I have noticed the battery getting to the point where I have to keep an external battery pack on me to recharge and a few glitches where I cannot call and have to turn the phone on and off to reset, as well as some camera glitch issues that I imagine were caused by almost 5 years of dropping the phone sporadically (with a solid case).  I am wondering if its time to make the switch to either the S24 Ultra or wait a couple of months for S25 Ultra.  I have only read a few rumors about S25 and its supposed to be better battery and camera and stronger screen than the s24 ultra so if that is the case I am willing to wait a couple of months. However, do people love their s24 ultras? to the point where I might be missing out on a good deal to get a s24 U that will be more or less as good as s25?  I live in the United States and am obviously also worried about the potential expected tariffs having an effect on pricing on S25 U.

"Unknown airtag alert - false positive? Hello. A few days ago, my OnePlus 6T phone alerted me of an unknown apple airtag moving with me. Neither my wife or I own any Apple Airtags. I've run a manual scan as well using ""unknown tracker alerts"" and I've gotten mixed results. Most results show the unknown airtag, but sometimes it doesn't detect anything. My wife has an iPhone 15 pro with all the location settings and tracker notifications on.... And she hasn't received any notifications about an unknown airtag.   Is it possible that my alerts are false positives? The manual scans do show, more consistently, that it finds an air tag when I am in my car even after driving 10mi + away from home.... But my wife's iPhone, still nothing, even after having her in the car for a 26mi round trip away from the home. I also did a hand sweep all around underneath my car.   I've also tried playing the airtag sound through the tracker app, but theres no sound anywhere when it says it's playing (I've also read that malicious people can just remove the speakers from Airtags....). I've contacted Apple, they think it's an Android problem... I contacted OnePlus today and they are investigating.  Anyone have an experience with this? Any insight is appreciated... This is driving me crazy... Thanks.",androidsever,1h4ac18

Longevity/eco-friendliness (I buy refurbished and I want them to last as long as possible, including physical durability because I'm clumsy)  2.

This was weird because I never downloaded them and my first thought was that my phone was butt-dowloading apps in my pocket. Thats never happened before and there were 5 of them so I checked my order history on the play store. None of these apps were downloaded from the Play store. When I checked to see where the apps were downloaded from within their information menus, they were all downloaded from the source 'Mobile Services Manager' (pictured).  I lookee to see what 'Mobile Services Manager' was and everything online said it's some sort of carrier software installed that allows them to push their apps to this device. None of these apps have anything to do with my carrier, Mint, though. I tried to disable the MSM program but couldn't find it in my apps nor anywhere on my phone using a keyword search.  The last thing that strikes me as odd is that the apps the MSM downloaded were old versions, as the app store showed they had updated when searched. I had Bit Defender at the time and have Bit Defender now. It did flag the apps initially but after they were scanned it showed no threats.  Not sure were to go from here. Is it my carrier?

I'm trying to get to the beginning of a url and it's really annoying and you have to scroll the cursor forever. It's pretty simple.

"Phones strong in camera, bettery, and longevity? Currently using a 4-year-old Samsung S9+ and have been disappointed in the battery life for about the past year, however now, it's draining so fast that I have issues getting through one day on limited usage, putting me in several tight spots while travelling/out and about. Previously have owned J and A series Samsungs, not majorly impressed with those either (the A series had a tendency to reboot itself 2-3 times a week towards the end of 3ish years of use). Wondering if it's time to give up on Samsung. Not prepared to wade into IPhones again, owned two of those back in 2010s, before that I had a HTC that I idolised (how are those U23/24 pro's doing now by the way?). But, I have no personal experience or people in my circle using any other brands- what are some good phones for a decent camera, strong battery performance, and that I can get 6+ years of good use out of without it going majorly downhill?

"How does notifications work across multiple devices? I have two android phones: one for work and one that is my private phone.  When both are power on at the same time I will get a notification on both of them (from whatsapp for example). And that's not weird, it's how it should be even if I have to dismiss and/or open the notification on both devices to get rid of it.  However I have the habit of powering off my work phone when leaving work and this is where I start to get confused. All notifications that I get since I turn my work phone off will all show up on it when I turn it back on. And the weirdest part is that this happens even if I have dismissed or opened the notification on my private phone. It seems to happen with all apps that I'm logged in to. It will occasionally freeze up my phone on start up if I have been away for too long and there are hundreds of notifications.  In my mind the apps shouldn't notify me of things that I have already acknowledged. Does apps not care about if a device is turned off, and why would the apps, when back online, not check if the notification has been acknowledged on another device before sending it again when it's irrelevant and dated?  The mail app on my PC doesn't bombard me with notifications of every single email I got since I turned it off, because it sees that all of them are read already. So why can't my phone do the same?  I have tried apps for syncing this between devices but non of them work  well enough to be reliable.",androidsever,1en4yox

"What are my options for getting data off my phone with a non working screen? I have an Oppo R7 Pro phone..  Earlier today, I dropped the phone onto a road, it got run over by several cars, and the screen and cameras are completely obliterated. The front screen is almost completely white with all the cracks.  However, miraculously, the phone is still working. The podcast I was listening to on my Bluetooth ear buds never even stopped playing while the cars were beating it to death. I can hear it chime when I get a message, the phone is still ringing, etc... So, I think the internals might still be largely okay.  I looked into replacing the screen, but it's expensive enough that it's only a little more to replace the phone entirely. So I'm thinking that's what I'll do, especially since the cameras are also destroyed. I'm probably going to just get a slightly more recent Oppo phone.  I think I've got a lot backed up on my Google Account, but there's some stuff on the phone, like message histories in certain apps, that I think I'll lose if I can't get into the phone.  Because the old phone with the smashed screen seems to be working otherwise, I have hope that maybe I can transfer data off of it to the new phone. But, I've hit a few snags.  If I connect by USB to my computer, it doesn't show up as a drive because I believe you need to press something on the screen to allow a connection.  Oppo has a feature where you can transfer data from an old phone to a new one... but, one phone needs to scan a QR code of the other. Whichever way round that is, it won't work.  I've looked into apps that claim to be able to control the phone via a computer, like Airdroid Personal, but they seem sketchy.

Brightness is the one of the most critical parts of proper HDR visuals so it's pretty bonkers how this seems to be so poorly implemented. True HDR would mean that the screen would be pushed brighter and fiddling with the brightness level slider should only affect SDR portions of the viewfinder and not the portion that is showing the HDR video. However, the brightness slider will very clearly affect the brightness of the HDR video. VLC doesn't even change the HDR/SDR ratio when playing an HDR file. The official files app can play some HDR files but it's pretty hit-or-miss. I'm using Kodinerds but the issue is that the video player UI and controls aren't as intuitive and accessible on a phone as they are on an Android TV with a remote.   Anyone have any suggestions?",androidsever,1drqtp2
"Using phone without registered imei number Hello, so i need you guys opinion. I was living in Canada and i bought Samsung Z Flip 5 which bootloader is locked. I didnt know that because i thought this wasnt a thing since all my other Samsung and non-Samsung phones i purchased in Turkey was possible to unlock and change their firmware as i like, like in EU. And i moved back to Turkey, my problem is there is stupid law that phones purchased from outside of Turkey has to be registered to local ministiry of communications for f... 1340 CAD. I bought this phone for a 1000 CAD; i would prefer using pigeons to communicate or android 2 or something instead of giving that much of ""tribute"" to my government for nothing.   I have bunch of old, decent and mid range new phones laying around so my question is, i dont know if this counts as illegal in this sub but, can i use their imei or hardware some kind. I have no idea about the technology used yet, im still searching but i am kinda tinkerer and also engineer i might apply some known found external solutions.

"Need Help Accessing MIDI Voyager Pro After Regional Restriction - Any Advice? Hi everyone,  I'm facing an issue with the MIDI Voyager Pro app, which I recently lost access to during my trip to Beijing. The app appears to be regionally restricted, and I can't find any close alternative on iOS or Android.   Order Details: - Order number: GPA.3393-5461-1010-97107 - Order date: April 4, 2023  Does anyone have contact information for the developer Adrian Kossow or bytebolt, or any solutions to restore access to the pro version?

"Headphones audio stuttering at certain volumes on new Samsung? Asking here because everywhere else on the internet is only concerned with bluetooth.      I have bought a new Samsung A15 today and I noticed that when my headphones are plugged in, at certain volumes the audio will stutter really bad. I bought it at a Tesco in Ireland, it was fully sealed and hadn't been pre used. The issue with my headphones isn't present on other devices, and the speakers of the phone aren't displaying the same issue.      I messed around with what volume settings I could but none seemed to impact it in any way. The volumes that do work are anything more than 50% and anything below 30%. The in-between area stutters really bad.  I still have the receipt for the phone, but I'm not sure if I should return it immediately or if this is something that can be fixed.

I need more space as I have almost completely filled the 256gb my 3 year old phone has.  My issue is that the new phone does have 512gb but also only USB 2.0 speeds out of the port.

"How to type letters with accents on Google keyboard? Hello everybody, so I just received my new Android phone (OnePlus Nord 3) after 6-7 years of being an iPhone user. So far I have been very satisfied but I have one question.  I come from a Slavic country and we use 2 types of accent signs very often. Caron "" ˇ "" and acute "" ´ "". I know there is this one way of typing letters with accents on mobile keyboards, which is to hold down the key for the letter and then you can choose different accented versions of that letter. However, I find this very slow and not smooth at all. This probably comes from the fact that for last 6 years I have been using iPhone where there was this keyboard layout where these two accent symbols are next to ""L"" and ""M"" letters (at the end of respective lines) and you could use them basically like ""dead key"" system on computers but in reverse. So I would type a letter, then the accent symbol and it would transform the letter before it to the accented version of the letter.   My question is: Is there a way I can achieve this on Google keyboard or any other keyboard app on Android?",androidsever,1d4px0x

GSMArena says the S series going at least as far back as my note20 has 32bit/384kHz audio.   Ok but why? There's no headphone jack and the phone speakers are nowhere near good enough for that resolution of audio. And Bluetooth just can't play that level of audio. Especially through earbuds where they have to cram a tiny DAC into the buds themselves. So why give the capability of such high resolution audio when there's no way a phone would be able to do anything with it? I'm assuming there's a reason. Most people aren't going to care about their music resolution and are perfectly happy with streaming, and the people that do care would never use their phone for music.   Is there a reason??

"Wife's phone is driving me (and her) crazy So, I could explain this in like 3 pages, but I won't. I'll do my best to summarize the key points. My wife's phone (data?) is pretty much every freaking day popping up information from my entire past, like a phone number I had from 10+ years ago showing up in recommendations for sharing a file, OR, showing accounts for pretty much any site that would at first glance seem to me, but they aren't. Like it'll have a username similar to mine but maybe only be partially spelled the same or have half my name it, OR pretty much ANYTHING and EVERYTHING that would make a person question whether or not their spouse is hiding things, or being shady or secretive in some way, but that's NOT the case. Her ex was really manipulative and shady with phone and Internet stuff like cheating and being inappropriate with other women online and whatnot, so this whole debacle is making her paranoid about me and I've never once done anything even close to the sort. It's gotten worse over time, I keep trying to tell her, because she's looked into so many things about me from my past that's is completely polluted her phone data and that in combination with AI is showing her things it think she's interested in, but she's really not, because it's driving her and me absolutely bonkers. The things she's seeing aren't even bad;  it's just normal everyday things but from like years and years ago so that makes her think I still for some reason am keeping something from her. This has literally been almost an every day thing going on for a very long time and has been an issue that leads to arguments basically me saying I either don't know what she's talking about, or have no clue why something is showing up that either isn't in fact me or related to me or is like super duper old and at this point can't even do anything about. I've gone into every account I can think of I've ever created over the past 15+ years and updated my info to my current, but it's literally impossible for me to remember every single account I've ever created for anything from a Samsung account to a dominoes pizza profile for easy ordering. She has several times paid for people lookup sites information on me and I'm thinking between that and her looking into everything for hours on end for days and over weeks and months that her own data has been polluted. I just can't think of any other reason why this would be happening so freaking much all the freaking time. I never see anything like this on my own phone so it's not something I'm doing.

"Switching to Android soon, what are some good cloud storage/backup options? I currently use an iPhone, about to jump ship and finally make the switch to Android hopefully as soon as Samsung drops their new S25 Ultra, I hear it won't be too much of a change from last gen but I'm not complaining, it will still be a big upgrade for me at least.     I've been stuck in Apple's ecosystem and have used iCloud throughout my childhood and teenage years. Let me tell you it's been hell the last few months. I've been trying to take care of all my ""Sign in with apple"" accounts, moving over my passwords, making sure every single one of my iCloud hide my email addresses gets forwarded to my Gmail or deleted if I no longer use the service, and a whole bunch of other stuff that still needs taken care of (I am slowly going insane and I feel very trapped in this ecosystem). Needless to say I do not want to experience this with again with Android so any service that works on ANY device and makes it easy to move data between services is a win in my book. I'm open to hearing your guys recommendations.     What do you do if you have an Android device when one wants cloud backups of your entire phone? For example my iPhone is set to backup all of it's contents to iCloud every night. It's pretty much a 1-1 copy of my phone's contents stored in iCloud, if I ever lose my iPhone or it gets damaged all I need to do is sign into a new iPhone and it's like nothing happened. All my apps, settings, messages, contacts, notes, etc... all come back with no issue. Does Android have something similar to this? It would be nice to have something like this that works across all devices so I wouldn't be stuck with one particular brand and can move over all my data across phones.  I saw a service Samsung offers called Samsung Cloud which is supposed to be similar to what I mentioned above if I understand correctly, however one news article I read says it was discontinued, yet the service is still advertised on Samsung's site? Don't know what that's about but I don't think I'd want to use it because again, I'm looking for a service that works across devices and from what I understand Samsung Cloud seems exclusive to Samsung phones.   I also know that Samsung has an ecosystem of their own that I'm trying to steer clear of. I've made a new rule for myself that everything I use on Android must have the ability to carry over to another manufacturer with no issues, no impact to the quality of the service itself, and must have the ability to easily take control of your data and move it around or delete it as needed.     As for iCloud Photos and iCloud Drive alternatives I'm looking at Google Photos and Google Drive as replacements, Microsoft's OneDrive is also something I'm considering but I'm open to recommendations if anyone knows of a cheaper, better, or even more privacy friendly alternative.",androidsever,1h7159l

"Want to switch from ios to android, but there are a few things holding me back. Looking for suggestions. Hey guys. There are a few things that ios does that are a huge quality of life improvement that, to my knowledge, android does not offer. I'm hoping to be proven wrong and am looking for suggestions on how, or if, the following can be done in android.  1. Due app on ios. I've tried about every reminder app in android and am always unhappy. I want to create reminders with a voice assistant(phone or pixel watch 3), and actually be able to SNOOZE the reminders by a custom amount of time. IE +1hr, +3hrs, or +1day etc. In addition, I'd like the option for the reminder to KEEP going off every 10 or so minutes until I manually dismiss or snooze. Too many times I miss a reminder because I'm busy and didn't hear it, only to never see the notification again since it disappears from lock screen etc.  Every app I've tried either doesn't sync with GA, or doesn't have the snooze option. I need both.  1.1 There are hardly any productivity apps(or any apps for that matter) that can be used with GA. Most apps I use on ios have the ability to use siri shortcut integration for automation. I used to use tasker and it's awesome, but tasker doesn't INTEGRATE into the android apps themselves. IE ""filebrowser pro"" app on ios has siri integration where I can automate my routine to copy files from my phone to windows PC. Siri integrates very nicely in most ios apps. I wish GA did this but it's best for asking questions, but I want to use assistant to actually assist with things and automate stuff etc.  2. Location-based reminders. This is built in to apple reminders and it's awesome. This feature must also work with point #1.  3. Ability to use voice assistant to text multiple people in 1 go. On android, if I say, ""ok google, text John Doe and Jane Doe, do you guys want to have dinner?"", it will send a text to John Doe with the msg ""and Jane Doe, do you guys want to have dinner?""   Compare that with ios, where it texts both John and Jane with the proper msg.  Also, if I have a group msg that's named ""climbing group"", I can say ""siri, text climbing group X msg"" and it works. Last time I tried sending named chats in google messages with GA it doesn't work.  A nice to have, but not must have, is being able to pin more than 3 chats in google messages. Apple can pin 9 and samsung messages can pin 20 pretty sure. I use this all the time on ios.  4. Assistant continued conversation. I've tried getting this to work on S23 ultra and couldn't get it to work. Pretty sure it's a pixel only feature, but pixel hardware and cpu is awful so I'd be getting samsung. I find continued convo VERY useful for skipping songs on spotify back to back. It's really nice to skip multiple songs without having to say ""ok google"" every time. Hoping someone knows how to get this working on samsung phone.  These are some points that I came up with on the top of my head. I'll add more as I think of them. I hate ios and want to use android. Does anyone know any solutions to my points above? Thanks!",androidsever,1h3p9ne

"App stopped working after updating to Android 15, looking for options/workarounds TL;DR: Looking for a way to run an app (compatible with android 14 and lower) on android 15. I suspect I may be mostly SOL, but worth a shot...  For some background, I'd been using a Sudoku app that I really like - I've tried a bunch of others but none really compare. About a year ago, the developer made some really awful changes, making the playing experience just terrible. I then side-loaded the previous version and had been using it since.  After I upgraded to Android 15, the app stopped working - it just froze when launched. The latest from the developer also exhibited this behavior until they released another update. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and while the app does install, it just won't launch properly.  Cracking open the .apk and making the updates myself seems like an unlikely scenario (even if I'm able to identify where things are breaking, it's doubtful I could make the needed changes).  Staying on Android 14 indefinitely seems ill-advised; feature-wise, I don't care, but I do want the security updates (right?).  I did find an app called Virtual Master which is quite interesting - I'm able to run a VM sporting an older version of Android, and the app runs just fine. It seems like overkill though, so I'm wondering if there might be an easier/more straightforward way of running this app. Might there be some other form of containerization or wrapper of some sort? Some settings that could be changed in the phone running 15?  If it matters, the device on question is a Pixel 7 Pro. Thank you in advance!",androidsever,1gljeji

"Don't know what phone to get for around 500-600 euros Right now I have a galaxy a33 and I would like to switch to a higher-end phone in the 5-600 euro range, that has a reliable and efficient cpu (like snapdragon 7 gen 3 or up), longer lasting battery and relatively clean and reliable software (so xiaomi is out of question).  I have looked at the phones in this price range, but I cannot decide because: - -Samsung galaxy s23: Great internals, but afaik the battery life is the same or weaker than my a33, and I dont know how future proof 8 Gb of ram is - -Motorola edge 50 pro: Great internals, looks very good but I read that the software is unreliable, as well as the frequency of updates - -Oneplus 12R: I dont care about the camera that much, but seeing a photo taken with it was kind of disgusting. Also I dont have any experience with curved screens, but it can be an inconvenience with accidental touches, more fragile, harder to replace and harder to find a good screen protector  - -Oneplus nord 4: This is a contender along with the galaxy s23, but it has overheating/thermal throttling issues, and although I don't really play games on my phone, I'm not sure how that would affect the smoothness if I were to do some heavier tasks on a hot summer day for example. - -Honor 200 pro: Read about some battery and software instabilities. - -Nothing phone 2: Glass back, I'm afraid it would shatter to pieces the moment I accidentally dropped it for the second time.

The fact that i use my phone for banking and 2 factor auth also is a problem that would benefit greatly if a good backup would be set in place.     While I never owned an iPhone, the backup solution was always something I wanted, just backup that original phone, and restore it to the new one, a fast way to get up an running if something happens or if you want to upgrade, that is something I am looking for.  I have already read about adb not being a reliable backup option, and that left me with no ideea on what else to do.  So, if anyone has a reliable backup scheme , please share it with me :) .  P.S. I dont plan on jumping ship to ios, it was only an example, also, routing is not an option as my banking app wont work afterwards.",androidsever,1fz0tbe
"Just swapped back after years of iOS and need some help. So far I'm happy with my decision I just need help with a few things. I have the s24.  1. How can I make apps have their own unique notification sounds? On iOS an app like Snapchat has it's own unique ringtone and notification sound that's only for that app. Same goes for Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger. It's annoying to pickup my phone every 3 seconds to see if it was a Snap or a weather update.  2. What is the best way to regain full functionality of my AirPods Pro?

"Has Superdrug Stopped Supporting My Phone on their Network? Hi,  My phone stopped being able to make/receive calls or send/receive SMS. Here's my enquiry to Superdrug Mobile (Three Network) and their reply.  Do you think this is legit or are they just running with my theory?   Hi, my phone (Pixel 7a Android 14) no longer connects to the Superdrug network and I am unable to make/receive calls or SMS (data works).  Things I have tried...  1: Restarting phone, 2: Power off phone, 3: different locations (known good signal), 4: resetting network settings, 5: manual network selection, 6: trying 5G, 4G and 3G, turning airplane mode on/off and putting SIM into my other phone (Sony XA2 Android 9) which could make/receive SMS but no calls.  The phone shows good signal strength but then displays no bars and ! after dialing. The settings for SMS and calls are ghosted and cannot be clicked.  My views...  It's not the phone as it has worked just fine up to now, it's 5G capable and the same issue persists when SIM used in other phone.  It's not location as I have driven to different areas with excellent reception.  I think it might be due to the discontinuation of 3G. Although my phone would often display 5G next to signal strength, I think this refers to data and my phone may have been using 3G or 4G but if this is true there would be many users with this issue and I don't think that Superdrug would stop supporting one of the most popular phones (again, issue on my Sony XA2 too).  I don't want to switch networks so your help would be greatly appreciated.  Their reply...  Thanks for bearing with us while our Tech Team investigated your calling issue.  As you may be aware, 3G was switched off across the Three network this month, meaning that any phone that was using 3G to make and receive calls will no longer be able to do so.  Phones now need something called VoLTE to be able to make and receive calls. The Google Pixel does have VoLTE, but we have discovered it is not compatible with Superdrug SIMs. We have reported this to Google and they have promised a software update to fix this by December 2024.  I’m very sorry, but you will not be able to make or receive calls using a Superdrug SIM until this date unless you get a new device. As much as we’d hate you to leave, if you need to do so you can request a PAC code here:    UPDATE: Problem solved! I switched to iD Mobile and got a 30 day rolling contact, unlimited data, calls and SMS. Even better, it's only £15 pm (£5 less than Superdrug).",androidsever,1fvv038

"Guides for utilizing older android phones? Hi all. I'm a bit lost and mildly frustrated at tech these days. So what's happening is that I take ample care of my devices (all were gifted, new or handed downs). I still have an old motofone f3, my old nokia-imitation bar phone working, my first JAVA touchscreen phone, then my android phones: my old samsung s5830(2011), a samsung galaxy j1 (2016), some unknown china brand android phone (2018), and most recently a samsung a42 5g (2020). they are able to receive calls and messages, and do alarms, but i'm becoming more upset (like some old grandma) that I can no longer use most of them for casual browsing wikis, casual checking e-mails. i'm not expecting the old devices to cater to the more sensitive things like online banking and electronic wallets, but when the support goes out everything just becomes a telephone+sms+alarm+mp3player. i'm wondering if there's a way for an average person can make better use of my old android devices, or if that's just how it is. Right now I'm dreading when the most recent one (a42 5g) reaches its end of life soon and i'll be soon forced to buy a new phone when i know that this one is working perfectly fine for light usage.

"Navigation bar prevents me from tapping the bottom of my screen Device: Samsung Galaxy A22 Software: Android 13 One UI Core Version: 5.1 IU  This only started happening two days ago.

"Can't select my region (USA) on an Android tablet. Consequences? I bought a used Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 (X110, ""international model"") on eBay. It had been factory-reset, and one of the first screens to pop up when I began setting it up, right after language, was ""Select your country"" (or region?).  I'm in the US and US was not an option. There were only 10ish countries listed, all relatively close to each other: Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Thailand, etc.   [Once I set it up, I checked and both my Samsung account and Google account are listed as US. Also, I factory-reset it again and the problem persisted.]  **What are the consequences of choosing the wrong region?**  I'll be using the tablet mostly for reading e-books, watching videos, and browsing the web. No special apps besides some newspapers and magazines.  **And if the consequences are bad, how can I set the region to US?** Searching online lead me to using Odin to flash firmware, but I'm a noon, and the files I'd need to download aren't US-based (unless I'm confusing something).

"Phone keeps switching to Edge reception Hello Guys,  i have a pretty annoying problem that i can solve. A Year ago i had a Samsung A52 5G that started to loose reception whenever i used Maps. It dropped from 5G to Edge but there was no connection at all. I thought something was wrong with the phone and after owning it for two years i switched to my Honor Magic 5 Pro half a year ago.  Now i have an even worse Problem. When using Maps or Android Auto(didnt used it with A52) and randomly when not using it i loose all connection despite it showing 5G and after a while it drops to E and i have literally no Internet connection.  Shortterm fixes are switching to plane mode or restarting the phone, but it only helps for a few Moments. As far as i saw mostly T-Mobile (i have telekom in germany) customers have this Problem but also other carriers are effected.  I tried a trick from a google Forum to delete Play services and carrier services cache.   I also reseted the phone AND installed a backup on to it but the problem keeps persisting.   So far i didnt try to install all Apps manually, because the effort would be pretty big.  So i am searching a Solution and hope someone maybe found a semipermanent fix.",androidsever,1eqlka0

"Lesser AudioSwitch app absolutely broke my phone I have a Redmi note 9 pro 5g(Gauguin and global model), bought it about a month ago. Phone has been working very fine till i downloaded an app called lesser audio switch ( available on the google play store). This was because i wanted to record my voice using the phone speaker whilst hearing myself through my wired headphones, and many people suggested this app will get the job done. It did work and the results were satisfying.  The application had three main options that i used with the main gist of the application being able to switch the microphone input source.  1. To use your phone's internal speaker as an audio output while simultaneously picking a different input for your mic such as headphone mic or USB mic 2. To use your wired headphones as an audio output while simultaneously picking a different input for your mic such as internal mic, headphone mic or USB mic 3. To use your bluetooth headphones as an audio output while simultaneously picking a different input for your mic such as internal mic, headset mic or USB mic  Here comes the issues. (This is all happened after I had installed the Lesser audio switch application and used it)  When I decided to connect my Bluetooth headphones this time round, i faced a big problem, I was unable to play any sort of media such as audio or video.   1. When i tried to watch any videos on Youtube, the videos would move absolutely slow and no sound would come out at all. 2. Couldn't hear anyone on the phone during a call. 3. Gallery videos and videos from other sites would not work at all. 4. Spotify and other music apps could not play any audio as well. A weird thing i saw, the playtime of the song would either stay in one place or move a few seconds in front then back and it would do this in a continuous loop.  Bare in mind, i did not have any of these issues when using my Bluetooth headphones before getting this application, everything worked well, no bugs, no nothing!  To be absolutely sure if this problem was only with my phone I did the following;  1. Tested the bluetooth headphones in other phones and bluetooth, audio and video all worked well. 2. Tried another pair of bluetooth headphones on my phone and the same issues came about.  That's not even the end of it, there was more to come.  After a few weeks, i decided to try out the bluetooth headphones again, in the hopes that i could fix the issue. I connected my bluetooth headphones, opened the lesser audio switch application and then I clicked on an option that forces your phone to play audio output from the phone's internal speaker.   From that I opened a music app, played a song and surely the audio did come out from my phone speakers while my bluetooth headphones were paired to my phone.  I try to change the audio output back to my bluetooth headphones and still no sound is coming out of them and no videos are playing, but also my phone has become extra laggy now.   I disconnect my bluetooth headphones and click on the option that changes my audio back to the internal speaker. I open youtube and videos can't play. I open music apps and music cannot play, the same issues i had while my phone was connected to bluetooth are now happening without any bluetooth device being connected or paired at all.   To make it the situation worse, there were also other problems such as;  1. Whenever i tried to increase or lower my phone volume, my phone would freeze for like 10 seconds 2. Whenever I decided to open different applications like video games my phone would freeze and the apps would crash 3. Whenever I tried to change my ringtone, my phone would freeze. Even when i tried setting an alarm ringtone  4. I would constantly get some messages like system UI is not responding, or settings is not responding, application is not responding.... 5. The microphone itself is not working.  6. Phone calls do not show or work 7. Can't play audio or videos in social media apps like WhatsApp, telegram...   Other things I have tried to do to fix this but have not worked are  1. Resetting bluetooth and WIFI settings 2. Factory resetting my phone about 5 times 3. Factory resetting and skipping any internet related steps 4. Switching to safe mode( problems were still there) 5. Clearing app date and cache of various installed apps and system apps 6. Switching to another web view 7. Switching to different options in the lesser audio switch app 8. Switching codecs in developer options  One last thing i want to try is flashing my rom to another, unfortunately I am facing challenges with that. I can't flash to recovery(believe me when i say i have tried everything to do that), and as of now i can't flash using fastboot because my phone is not letting me unlock the bootloader yet.  My last area to look is reddit, if anyone can help me, I will truly appreciate!!!  Also found out a lot of users who gave the app one star on playstore are facing the same problems      tldr: Lesser AudioSwitch broke my phone audio and video playback and I don't know how to fix it as of yet. I also do not recommend anyone to download this application unless they want to fuck up their phone",androidsever,1efnxbz

"Sick of Apple I have used Apple products since 2013. But I’ve had enough for various reasons. The biggest one being privacy. I’ve had the option for an upgrade for a while now, but never pulled the trigger out of fear. Even though deep down I knew I was done with Apple. Finally decided today was the day I was going back to an android. When I tried doing it online, it kept trying to push me towards Apple. So I got frustrated and called. The guy on the phone seemed really surprised and again tried to push me to get an iPhone. When I declined, he told me that because I was not sticking with Apple, my upgrade fees would be higher. I didn’t get a straight answer when I asked why. He just kept saying Apple deals were always better. Has anyone else ever experienced this or know why this is. Because it feels like Apple is a g*** and I’m having to be jumped out because I want to leave. I know I’m being dramatic but I’m just really ticked off.   *also just a side note. He also told me taxes on androids were higher.",androidsever,1dw161k

"How do I prepare and tune an old Android phone to proper function as bluetooth mp3 player? Hi all, my question seems simple (like ""why don't you just remove all useless apps, put it in airplane mode, load music, enable bluetooth and go?""), but it lies elsewhere.  I have an old Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo with the GPS antenna problem (I tried to fix it to use it as navigation system but no luck), it's perfectly functioning and with a recently replaced battery, so it would be sad to dispose of it (IDK what one could do with that, considering that where I live the 3G is gone).  **My problem is the battery draining**: I have a custom rom of Lineage (Android 7.1.2) and I saw the phone won't last more than 1 day with airplane mode, all off (NFC, position, all wireless connection) and no app at all (the basic one like Camera, File, Messages, Music, Clock, Radio FM, Recorder audio). Other apps are uninstalled / disabled.   Yes the battery isn't original (even if it says Samsung on that) but newest and more modern phones last even a week without airplane mode.   Even my old iPod Touch 2nd gen (2008, 16 years ago) with original battery is at 94% after 2 days and a half in idle.  What am I missing? There is somerhing in background that keeps running and need to be fixed/removed? I need to use another custom rom more light? (but I remember this to be light back in the days).  I have root permissions so I can do anything on it.  Thank you in advance.",androidsever,1dmo02t

Is there any way to solve this? Is there any way to get gesture navigation on Android?--  Turns out there's an app called gesture control and for a mere $4 you can have fully customized gesture control. It's great now I can just swipe from the right side of my screen as a back button which is so much more ergonomic.

"Google Gallery photos/videos do not match order of Google Photos Hi all, picked up a Pixel 8 Pro today and seem to be having an issue with the chronological order of photos transferred from my old phone. In Google Photos, the order seems to be correct, however any app that accesses the local storage by default is in the incorrect order, including Google Gallery which I use as my offline gallery app since there was no default gallery app that came installed with the phone like in previous devices I'd had. In addition, it shows videos first and then photos, regardless of order. For example, when trying to upload a photo on something like Discord, the Discord gallery view shows videos and photos I may have taken years ago as ""most recent"", and I can't for the life of me figure out how to correct that.  When I download my Google Photos album, it just resets all the photos ""modified at"" or ""created at"" date to the current date, instead of keeping the dates that are clearly saved in Google Photos so I don't think overwriting the local storage with that would work. Essentially any method I can think of ends up overwriting the original photo time/date data. What can I do? Takeout by Google that takes days to complete?",androidsever,1da2p7b

"Phone/antenna not working properly, would appreciate opinions Hi people. I have a Pixel 5 that i bought refurbished about a year ago. When I got it, I was super happy with it but after a few months, it stopped working with my cell network (T-Mobile). It connects and disconnects from the cell network constantly. I went to T-Mobile and they replaced my SIM card, which fixed the issue for a couple weeks, but then the problem came back.  This entire time, wifi worked fine. No issues. I haven't replaced the phone because I'm usually at home or the office. I can also reboot the internet manually on my phone, which will get it to reconnect for T-Mobile, at least for awhile (by which I mean like, five minutes.

"How to keep Gmail app unread notification dot staying ? Hello all, I have a new phone, coming from an old one therefore and old android version (Galaxy S7 > S24 lol).      One thing that bugs me out is about Gmail notification : When I have an email, I get a notification dot on the app icon as expected. But if I go inside the app to check a bit more about the mails or mails I receive, it totally deletes the dot on the app !   I am sure that before, the notification dot was a direct synchronisation of read/unread emails, and it's what it should be, otherwise it's pretty useless, I don't want the badge to disappear whenever I just open the app to check emails to respond to later... (note that I use my phone for work).  Is there a way to fix this ? I already looked up on Google, tried to to into every settings inside the phone without success.

"Can't Add App to Google Play Family Library After an excruciatingly painful process I finally managed to set up Family Library for my family group on Google Play (why do they hide it where no one would look??).

"Motorola G84 insists SD card needs formatting. Card works fine elsewhere I have a SanDisk external SD card that is formatted in exFAT, works fine on a PC, and has worked fine across multiple Android devices.      Last week I moved from a Motorola One Fusion to a Moto G84, Android 14, and this new device doesn't read the card, whether plugged internally or via a card reader connected through a USB-C cable: in both cases it identifies there's a SanDisk SD card there, but insists it's corrupted and needs formatting.      I read in some places about newer versions of Android and having to define an SD card as internal or external usage, and in one case that going to ""format"" would give that option, even with the card already formatted. In my case it just warns all data will be erased, so I haven't moved beyond this yet (since I want to move the contents to the internal storage).      I'm considering moving the data to a PC, and then on to the phone directly from a PC. But I'm puzzled about why the Moto G84 won't read the SD card at all.       Any ideas?",androidsever,1cvjpyf
"Allow all calls while asleep via DND or Bedtime Mode OK this has been driving me crazy and actually impacting my work because I'm on call after hours and need to be able to answer any call I receive 24 hours a day certain weeks.  **I want to be able to hear any call I receive from anyone but mute all other notifications while my phone is charging at night.**  When I used to use my Pixel Stand there was a setting to turn on Do Not Disturb while charging. This was perfect because you can customize DND to allow all calls to interrupt. Now I use a 3rd party wireless charger and as far as I can tell there is no setting in Android to turn on DND while charging.  Except for Bedtime Mode, which does allow you to activate it while charging within specific hours. Bedtime Mode also lets you turn on DND. *However*, the DND in Bedtime Mode doesn't follow your customized settings in DND for some reason. Bedtime Mode DND only allows starred callers to interrupt.

"So, how does Android Photo Picker work for permissions? I can't seem to find much information around Photo Picker.   From what I gather, it has its own ""albums"" which are screenshot, download, camera, and video. It gets these from ""somewhere"" that don't even match what they say. For example, I have images coming up under download that are not even in my download folder and it still sees them when I move this folder. I can't reliably add images to this album either - I can't see at all how it's getting these photos.  Because of the album flaws, I'll call them flaws, you use the ""big"" list which you have to scroll forever to find what you want. There is no search and no quick scroll option. If you have say 10,000 images - this is not practical to use.   I'd like to think I'm using it wrong it just seems in the little information I can find and user posted information, it seems it's just lacking in features and details.  In all my searching, I can't find information of how these albums are created and information stored. How an image shows in the download album, when it's not in my gallery under download, makes no sense.   Does anyone have any information on Photo Picker and best practices? How to actually use it in a meaningful way?   I love the idea of giving apps access to certain files/folders instead of wide open access. I just can't seem to get Photo Picker to work well.   Note: apparently the addition of cloud allows you to do albums by folder in a way, but it needs to be stored in the cloud. I can't use cloud storage for this and only using local images - which is where they are all stored. It also seems backwards to have to upload images to cloud just to download them when Photo Picker uses them. This is not practical either for larger files or a large number of them.   Any tips would be great because this seems like a great feature, I just can't grasp it's proper usage and it seems lacking a lot of usability options.   This also seems like a huge plus and way to get around the slow loading gallery bug in apps (that is say you are in Instagram, you choose upload, and not all images show. Going back and forth a few times more images will load/shoe). By only selecting what you want to upload, it should load instantly and in my testing and usage this seems to be the case.  Photo picker also seems to have access to more than what you pick. For example I have 1 photo allowed for Instagram but 100 show and I can upload them. My thoughts these are cached to Instagram or in a folder Instagram has access to that Photo Picker doesn't show. Which seems weird and makes it feel broken.

"Broken AAC bluetooth decoding on Android 13/14 After my Samsung S22 was updated to **Android 13 and then 14** I noticed a drastic loss of audio quality in Bluetooth playback in earbuds/headphones/speakers using **AAC decoding**. Both in my earbuds (Anker Soundcore Life A2 NC) and in my headphones (Bose NC700) I notice a high **distortion of the sound** as if it plays at 96kbps.

I've tested on other phones with Android 13/14 (Samsung M52, Google Pixel 6, and Xiaomi 12) and all of them have the same problem. However, this distortion appears to only occur when audio is decoded using the AAC codec. If you switch to an audio device using LDAC, the problem does not occur. Some could argue that this is a consequence of AAC being a lower-quality codec, but this is not true as the problem does not occur in devices running Android 12 or lower.

"Using International SIM in the US, Signal Problem After 2 Months Hi, I brought my phone and sim card from my country while I am staying in the US. I use it to connect to my bank back home. There is another phone from the same carrier for similar purpose for my mom that is automatically connected to TMobile here. My mom has had that phone for 3 years now and it is still working fine (the number is still valid and paid).  The newer phone that I brought was working fine for 2 months. It got automatically connected to TMobile as well when I arrived back in the US. I could receive OTP texts and other stuff no problem. Recently I ran out of battery, and I charged it. When I turned it on, it did not pick up the signal. When it did pick up, it was Verizon Wireless. I tried accessing my banking app, of which it is supposed to send me OTP text, but it never came. The text does not work anymore. I even factory reset my phone, I also tried manually changing my mobile network to TMobile, it would not connect.   I tried inserting the SIM to my mom's phone, it works there. I could receive text messages. I figured it is a problem with the phone. I am at loss what to do, if this phone can work like before or not... the banking app is attached to this number and phone, so I am so bummed out that this is happening and losing access.

"Is MediaTek as good as Snapdragon? I am not technical  & my knowledge is limited.  Long story short:  In 2019, Snapdragon was the best. Now with improvement in tech and cooling systems in mobile, how is the landscape in 2025 (we are almost there). Which chipset is the best? For me, minimum life of a mobile is 5 yrs and I want long term software update - update by Manufacturer or via Custom ROM. Given my technical limitations, I would love the manufacturer to support for long. Also, I am under the impression that chips contribute to long term software support.  I am not a gamer.     Long story:  In 2019, Nexus 5 was my personal device & Samsung Note 8 (Exynos) was my work phone given by my company. I was planning to upgrade my personal device, In the metro (public transport) I met a technician working for Samsung service center. He advised me that I should only buy a device with Snapdragon processor as it's very efficient & doesn't heat up. He suggested Samsung A71, which I bought.  I am a very happy customer of Samsung A71. My only issue is the lack of 5G, but I don't use too much mobile data. My main use of mobile data is for navigation app & whatsapp.   But regarding the Note 8, a friend managed to get Note 8 running on Snapdragon and I could clearly see the difference when using it. My Note 8 gets hot quickly, I just assumed that compared to Nexus 5 & A71, it has more high-tech in it. But when I got to compare it to Snapdragon, I was surprised to see the difference. The Exynos version of Note 8 was clearly inferior.  This is why I feel Snapdragon is superior.  Now looking at current Samsung line, I disheartened to see everything is Exynos. In other brands also, I see Snapdragon models are few. Now the Mediatek Helio & Dimensity, seems to be the popular one.  Online reviews, people are comparing it to Exynos and saying how much better is it. But no much comparison to Snapdragon.  I also see that now phones have cooling system built-in like Mi's LiquidCool. How has this changed technology today? Has the chips gotten hotter and with the cooling system, its still hot as the chips in 2019?  I still use my nexus 5 as my home device. Youtube remote for seeing videos on my TV. Music player. So, I need long life. I am of the understanding that the chip contributes to that in some way.  Also, I see custom ROM is mainly for Snapdragon. Is that because Snapdragon is popular or Snapdragon is Custom ROM friendly? How is MediaTek compared to that?  I don't play games, my use for the device is messaging, navigation, listening to music, then using baking apps. Not into video editing or even taking videos. Most of my photos are where I park my car or some cats & dogs I see on the street.",androidsever,1hg3uld

Chrome would flash like a bullseye before it would load. On our network, it listed my phone as an ""Android 14 device"" my husband's phone was listed as ""Galaxy S23"". I asked him why mine showed as a generic device and his showed up as an actual Samsung device. He said he didn't know, it's probably no big deal. It's a huge deal to me.   I saw on a different sub reddit where the OP was asking about a flashed operating system Yada Yada Yada. Anyway, my question is, can I get the original OS back on my phone.

No pin/login required, the tablet should be considered accessible by anyone since it's in my home so anyone who can touch it is considered a guest.  It's not in a public place 2. The screen should stay on indefinitely while the stereo is on 3. Whenever the stereo turns on, Plexamp should be loaded & maximized 4. Plexamp should start playing music automatically when the stereo is turned on 5. When the stereo is turned off, plexamp should stop playing music and the screen should eventually turn off 6. Other apps should be password protected or logged out (app store, google etc)  Attempt 1: Pixel 3A XL  I started this journey with a Pixel 3A I had lying around.  But the main problem was that I could not create a guest user (to solve #1).  A quick google search suggested that multiple users was not supported on pixels.  So sounded like a hard stop.  Attempt 2:  Cheap android tablet. Random manufacturer.  I then switched to a cheap tablet from amazon (<100 EUR).  I was able to make a second guest account and disable the lock screen (solves #1).  I then unlocked developer mode and selected the ""enable the Stay awake"" option (solves #2) together with a USB charger and a power bar that only turns on when the stereo is turned on using an old school master/slave powerbar.  Since i'm using an IFI bluetooth DAC, i set up Tasker to open Plexamp & start playing music whenever it connects to that specific bluetooth device (solves #3 & #4 & 5).  But I ran into an issue with #6.  Because tasker is a paid app. So as soon as I log myself out of the playstore or remove my google account, tasker stops working because it no longer sees that i have purchased the app.  And this specific tablet/manufacturer doesn't support locking up apps.  Attempt 3:  Samsung Galaxy S20 FE  Again stuck on #1. Multiple users are disabled.  This is too bad because I found that the ""Modes & routines"" was able to do the same as tasker and solve 3,4 & 5 without having to purchase any apps.  Of course I could settle with the single user and make that the primary user just for the jukebox. But this phone is new enough that i'm still using it.  It's not a ""fun"" phone yet.  So i need to be able to switch to my main user profile with all my apps.  Attempt 4:  Samsung Galaxy A40  Again stuck on #1. Multiple users are disabled.  Now this one is a fun phone so i decided to try and use this phone by wiping it and then using the main user account for the jukebox setup.   But i found out that the samsung Modes & Routines option is not available on this phone.   Using tasker as the alternative would again get me stuck on the same limitation as the cheap android tablet.  These all feel like frustrating limitations.  I'd rather have a multi-user feature and a Modes & Routines feature in my pixel than a bunch of AI.  But I assume as a tinkerer, i'm too small of a minority.  Although tasker has 1 million downloads so that doesn't seem entirely trivial to me.  Attempt 5:  Old Dell Windows 8 tablet (Venue 8 Pro) running windows 10.  No plexamp or plex app possible to install due to 32 bit obsoleted.  And I could not find a solution for 3,4&5 with plex web client  Have i missed any options on any of the above?",androidsever,1gyqq66

"Phone keeps shutting off/restarting during factory reset A few weeks ago i broke my phone (Nokia 7.2), and switched to a different device until i could get it fixed. I got the phone fixed yesterday, and decided to factory reset it, to use my google account to transfer any contacts and apps that i've adopted into daily use while on the in-between phone.   Doing so has caused the phone to shut down and restart. It will now either stay shut down, or be in a bootloop when hooked up to a charging cable. When in said bootlop, it'll start, get past the android logo, not show the nokia logo, and then show a white cirlce with some color accents pulsing around it, and the text ""Wird gelöscht "" (german for: ""being deleted/wiped""). It will show this screen for about a minute or two, and then shut down. (or reboot, uf currently charging). I've let it do this for about 2-3 hours in the hopes that it might change it's behaviour over time, but no luck.  I've tried accessing the recovery mode menu, to try and, again, force a factory reset through it, but am unable to acces it. It allows me to get into the bootloader (power+volume down), but if i proceed to boot in recovery mode, and then press the button combination to open its' menu (power+volume up) it shows a black screen with the text:  \-- Wiping data...   <linebreak>   Formatting /data...  this is in the two bottom lines on left of the screen.

"90% of my apps stopped working (including gallery etc.) Hey so I think I have an issue with the software.   My phone doesnt work properly since Thursday (3 days ago). 90% of my apps, including my pictures and videos fail after I tried to open them. I tried everything I could to fix it but I'm out of ideas.  It seems to be a problem with the android system webview (asw) or Google chrome. Honestly I have no clue what I'm doing so I mainly tried to follow the instructions of people on the internet. I have a Huawei P30 pro.   This is what I already tried to do:  - uninstall asw - uninstall chrome - emptied chaches - forced the stop of both - tried to upgrade both again - turned my phone on in safe mode to check if it's an issue with another app I have but I have the same problem even in safe mode - got rid off a lot of data to get some more space on the phone - activated a different asw  - tried the beta version of the original asw  Some instructions came with a specific order to uninstall and install the system but nothing worked.   Currently asw and chrome latest update is un-installed.  As soon as I update Chrome I'm not able to use the internet either.  I don't know what to do anymore and it doesn't seem to be a general issue currently cause there's no latest post about it. So I don't think there will be an update to get it fixed.  And yes.

"Looking for Android Phone Suggestions (with Caveats) I know this has been asked sooo many times, but I'm looking for a new Android phone, and have very specific requirements:  1. **It cannot be a Chinese brand phone.** Yes, I know it's a dumb thing to exclude that, but my office is paying for the phone, and we're a big government contractor. Some of our clients refuse to speak with us if they find out we're using a Chinese brand phone. Really shallow, I know (I'm sure some parts will always be Chinese), but I'm not paying for it, so gotta follow the rules. Have to be clear that Taiwan is ok for them. Just not mainland China.   2. **Pixel is also out.** In my country, the Pixel isn't ""authorised"" or something, so it can't pick up 5G or use VoLTE/VoWIFI. VoWiFi in particular is something I use daily.   3. **Preferably not Samsung.** I'm currently on the S24 Ultra, but not too happy since the charging port keeps breaking (had it fixed twice and is still now broken). If the S25 is my best bet, then I'll consider it.   So that's it. The no Chinese and no Pixel issues make it hard to pick a phone, so I'm turning to Reddit for help!

"Separate the media volume like on iOS? Game app sounds versus audio app music/video I'm an Android user helping a friend switch over from iOS.

But also I don't want to turn the noises *off* because sometimes I like them. Is there a way to sync the volume to whether your phone is on loud or not? With Apple I'd just toggle on or off and then apps like that would or wouldn't make all their noises. It didn't affect TikTok or anything, ofc, because those are videos and *should* make noise  According to [this support page from Apple]( the Silent mode on iOS doesn't impact an audio app, like a music/video app, but it does silence (some) games.   So, my question is: **does anything like this exist for Android?** I realize there's the ""Media manner mode"" in the Samsung Sound Assistant app, but that silences *all* media when the phone is on vibrate or muted, which isn't how iOS works.",androidsever,1gadawt

"App Development Hey guys, my team and I are excited to announce that we're developing a new app called ArmourVault, and we'd love to get your feedback 😄  Brief overview of the app:   ArmourVault is designed to be a comprehensive platform for managing and securing your data in one central location. Here are some of its key features:  Uncompromising Security: ArmourVault prioritizes your data security with end-to-end encryption. This means your data is encrypted on your device before it even reaches our servers. We employ a zero-knowledge architecture, so we have absolutely no access to your decryption keys or the data itself and implement client side encryption. To further ensure security, we plan to submit ArmourVault for independent auditing and explore making the application open source as we approach the final stages of development.  Effortless Organization: Beyond secure storage, ArmourVault offers integrated tools for easy file management. These include a built-in text editor for notes and documents, the ability to capture photos and videos directly within the app, and support for a wide variety of file types. All data entries are neatly categorized for quick access.  Powerful Note-Taking: Our comprehensive note-taking feature allows you to create folders, tag individual notes, and utilize a range of editing tools. Organization is a core principle within ArmourVault.  Enhanced Privacy with Shadow Vaults: We've introduced a unique feature called 'Shadow Vaults'. These are separate, hidden containers within the app, each accessible with a unique passcode distinct from your main app password. You can even use the Shadow Vault in a vice versa manner.  Simple and Private Account Creation: ArmourVault respects your privacy. No personal details are required for account creation; all you need is a username and a master password!  We believe ArmourVault offers a powerful and user-friendly solution for data security and management. We value your input and invite you to share your thoughts and suggestions with us.

"Is there a way to keep an old ""version"" of WhatsApp in device? Hi there! I just bought a new phone but I want to keep all the old conversations in the old one.  **Is there a way to do it? I tried disabling the Wifi + Data for the app and then log in WhatsApp from the new phone, but it keeps logging me out. Should I try something line NetGuard, so I can fully disable connection to Internet?**  The reason I want to do that is because I have a large conversation history from 2017 with a lot of important data (family that is no longer alive, passwords, info, etc). I don't want to move all these into my new phone, as I want to keep it as clean as possible, however I want to have the possibility of accessing to it whenever I want.

"Need to delete corrupted file I have an undeletable file in my android/data folder. I can rename it, but no matter what I cannot move or delete the file... I suspect it fails as the files are LOCK and .ldb files for spotify, and for some reason android just cant delete the files as they seem to be locked?  I have used multiple different file managers, and even tried to delete from my PC yet all have given some generic error.  I just want to know if anyone has a relatively quick painless solution as id rather save the numerous hours by just keeping it than factory resetting it just for this unkillable 4mb file ;-;    edit: for more info, this all started when i was messing around with spotify as it occasionally stopped playing by deleting and reinstalling multiple times, but the corrupt file interfered with setup until i realised i could rename it.

"Samsung S24 or Pixel 9 So its time to upgrade my phone (currently using xiaomi 12t), and I have an eye out for the s24 and the pixel 9. But I'm still thinking which one is the best for my usage.   So i want a phone that can last me a whole day cause I usually have a sot of around 6h-7h. So battery is important. And I know the charging speed of these two phones are slow but I can live with that.   I want a phone with a good camera. Personally, I don't care if my phone is not the BEST camera out there. But If the picture/video I shoot with the phone is good and reliable then I'm okay with it. But I will always prioritize the photo/video taking experience more than the photo/video capability.  About the performance, I don't really mind tbh. Cause I'm not using my phone for gaming that much. But I do care about the longevity of the phone. So I want a phone that can last me at least 3 years before considering upgrading to another phone.  Now after doing some research(watching yt), I'm interested in these two phones. Which one do you think match my usage? Someone can tell me their experience with these phones.

"Android tablet I recently dumpster-dived (with permission) an industrial medical-grade Advantech-HIT-W153 tablet. I took it apart to get to the innards, an M.2 SSD. The SSD is not user accessible without taking the whole back apart, but the tablet has what appears to be a CAT5 port and a mini USB port.   According to the software engineers where I got the tablet, it’s running Android 10. I’ve put the M.2 SSD into an SSD enclosure to access it.   I’ve got a Win10 laptop and so far, I’ve had no luck accessing the OS. I’m planning to put a Linux emulator on my Winbox and see if i can access it. (One of the stipulations of taking the tablet was to report back if there’s company or sensitive data on the tablet so I can’t just wipe it until I’ve checked that out.)  Once I’ve done that, I’m planning to put a fresh Android 10 install on the card and see if I can get the tablet to boot.   Does anyone have suggestions as to where I can get the OS?

"Extremely loud notification sound for no reason Dear all,  I am using a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra with Android 14. It worked at the very beginning, but after a few months the following problems with notification sounds started (I believe it was triggered by some update).  Every now and then the notification sounds are suddenly extremely lound despite no change in the settings. When I open the volume menu, all slides still have normal settings (around 20% of the possible maximum volue). Still the phone internally seems to go to maximum volume. It's so loud that the speaker cannot even play the sound properly but comes with some weird cracking noise in the background. I lived with this for some time now, but it's really annoying when the phone decides every now and then to jump scare you while working.  It is definitely a software problem. When I change the slider in the settings (a bit up and then down to the original setting again), it goes back to normal. But after some time (a few days to weeks) it starts again. I guess certain updates cause the system to internally set the volume to maximum, despite the UI shows no change.  Googling yields only useless results. It describes the most obvious reason for loud notifications: a wrong setting, and the advice is to change the setting. That's not the reason in my case.  Does anyone else have this problem?",androidsever,1fldwjj

"Mobile store stole my nudes, what can I do? As the title states, a mobile store employe stole my nudes. I sent my phone in for repair for a cracked screen, and I dropped the phone off at the same store I bought the phone at. Standard procedure is to deactivate your passcode for the screen lock, and so I did. I watch the employe put my phone in an envelope, seal it and post it for the offsite repair shop. So far so good. Then, the day after, I'm off to work, and travel for 3 weeks. In the meantime I get some text from the mobile store, that my phone is repaired and ready for pick-up. I return from work the 16/1, and pick up my phone the same day.  Later that day, I checked my screen time app, and it shows an hour of activity the evening before, while it still was in the shop. I then proceed to check with apps are used, and to my horror someone opened my snapchat, dropbox, messenger and gallery app. I then proceed to check out my dropbox activity, and someone created a direct link containing 80 nudes. The link is timestamped 15/1, when the phone still was at the shop. I also check out my google activity, and the same apps are logged in myactivity.  Some images are also downloaded from my dropbox to the phone, and according to the log, they opened Huawei share. They later deleted the pictures. I only know this because some image recovery app I downloaded from play store. I also noticed a new saved wifi in my wifi list, and when I visited the store, my phone connected to the wifi, with I now know is the stores own wifi.  Ive reported all this to the police, sent countless screenshots of the different timestamps and logs. The police obtained the security footage from the shop, but its bad quality, and they can't make anything out of it. They do however have a suspect, as he was the only one at the store at the time all this happened, but they states its not enough to press charges. They need more proof. Is there any way I can extract logs for when I was connected to the stores wifi? Or anything else? Are there other logs on android I can extract? Im desperate!  Update: Short little update, I downloaded all the data Google has stored on me, a whopping 42 GB of data. Can't seem to find any logged ips for the activity though. Also requested data from Instagram, no luck as they only log sessions, not individually log ins. My last hope is getting the data from Dropbox, and that there's something more substantial logging there.  And yes, I know it's an incredible stupid mistake, and I did delete other sensitive information on my phone before handing it in, but this Dropbox folder is 6 years old, and I forgot it was even there.  Also, no point in posting on legal advice, as I'm outside the u.s.   UPDATE	#2: I've been digging through all the data I requested from difrent services, in hope of finding any logged ip's, when I got a call from the detective in charge of my case. They just charged a guy and confiscated his phone and personal laptop. He of course denied to have anything to do with the case, but all the timestamped logs was compared to the shift list, and he was the only one at the shop at the time. So now I just gotta wait for the forensic team, or what one should call it, to proper analyze the computer and phone. I really hope they find something, cause it would suck not getting the right guy.

"Cop bypassed and disabled my pin and fingerprint, and deleted some video evidence. Can i prove he did it? So, to make a VERY, VERY long story, short, I was falsely accused of doing some things earlier, and arrested, although I had video proof showing I DIDN'T do those things. The cop that arrested me, took my phone from me, and put it in his pocket instead of taking it to my grandmother, like I had asked, and once we got to the jail, I told the corrections officer that the cop had my phone. The CO asked the cop for my phone, and the cop said no, he was going to keep it for a little while. Now, I didn't think I had to worry about anything, because I had fingerprint login and a pin number that nobody knew, however, when I got my phone back, after I got released, the pin number and fingerprint had been disabled, and the video was deleted. I was luckily able to restore the video from the trash can, however, what that cop did was against the law. Is there any way to prove who removed my security, and attempted to delete that video? If not, it'll be my word against the police department, therefore not worth my time to press charges.   Now, if it helps, my phone is an LG K20 plus on metro PCS, and I took a screenshot of the video in question in the ""trash"" folder, but i'm not sure if it'll help.

But I'm checking into the recent launches, and came across the phone from POCO called F4 GT. The phone is yet to launch, nor are all the features revealed yet. But I assume they will be out by the next week during an online launch event as stated by the Official Poco Twitter handle.  Here's what i know of the phone and how i think it might be able to tackle the issue of underwhelming gaming performance:  • It comes with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which I feel well be competent to deliver a good performance and multitasking capabilities. Poco even claims the chip is further optimised to run games such as Genshin Impact comfortably over hours on end without any significant issue of performance dips.  • With LiquidCooling 3.0, it boasts a dual vapour chamber wherein two massive chambers cover the SoC and charging ICs separately. The phone already did a great thing, in terms of architectural innovation, in my opinion, by keeping the SoC and the charging ICs far from each other. Ensures better heat dissipation.  • 120W HyperCharge and Dual Battery: It has the potential to charge up a phone to 100% within 20 minutes since there are two separate batteries in it. Playing while plugged in on charging won't hamper with your comfort as it has an L-shaped cable which helps keep your grip maintained without any physical inconvenience.  Hence, with all these points I'm kinda convinced I might be able to dive into some serious gaming sessions over hours uninterrupted. Now, only if i knew the price... expecting somewhere near $800, since other mobile with similar configurations cost even more but POCO keeps the price competitive.  So, guys, do you know anything about gaming phones? Can you tell how real would the actual performance be of this phone? Also, are there any other criteria do I need to pay attention to if I want to buy a gaming phone?",androidsever,uadpo1

"(PSA) If half your apps are suddenly crashing repeatedly, disable Google Chrome Like you, I freaked out when well over half my apps started crashing on startup, and my first thought was this sub (after checking for malicious apps and restarting twice, of course). The common solution seems to be disabling, uninstalling, or removing updates for ""Android System WebView,"" but my phone (Galaxy S9, Android 8) doesn't show this in Play Store or Settings, and you can't uninstall an app/system feature that you seemingly don't have (or is hidden). Lots of people are reporting that their older phones/Android versions don't have WebView as well.  Just one person in a crossposted thread suggested disabling Chrome. Out of options, I tried it, and sure enough all of my apps are suddenly working again. I can't uninstall it without root, but I could uninstall the updates, that was unnecessary for me but if simply disabling doesn't work for you, that's worth a shot. Anyway, try this and/or disabling WebView, before you make a new post.",androidsever,mb1no1

"I found my dead brother's phone My brother (25M) was schizophrenic, and he killed himself last year, unexpectedly. He was very paranoid and hid most of his life from all of us, even me, despite living with me.  This made closure really hard - we had no pictures of him as an adult, aside from his facebook profile picture, we didn't know who his friends were, and most importantly, we don't know if he left us any suicide letter. He certainly didn't leave a hard copy, and I checked his laptop - nothing.  We couldn't find his phone, until today. He died in my parents garage, and the phone was under a cabinet there.  We'd really like to be able to unlock his phone to see if there is anything that can give us closure. It's an android with a pattern lock. Can anybody provide any advice?",androidsever,gc54vu

"Google Search app not appearing in Recent Apps screen (usually) So first some background: Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, One UI 5.1, android 13, Canada, Rogers  The issue(or behaviour I guess if it's intentional) has been ongoing through multiple system updates and I have seen other people with entirely different phones report similar things so I believe it's related to the google search app itself rather than the phone or os version but that's speculation   Now here's the actual problem I'm having. When I open Google search then navigate away, the app does not subsequently show up in recent apps and allow me to navigate back to it. However this behavior isn't entirely consistent, at times, rarely, the search will show up in recent apps like any other app, and I can't seem to identify a pattern to when it does. I'm also not sure than the app closes itself because often clicking on the Google search icon in the suggested apps list at the bottom of the recent apps screen will bring up the search app with my previous search results still in place. I'm not certain when this behavior began but I do know that previously search would appear in recent apps the same as any other app would. I'm also not certain how much of this is intended behaviour. I'd like to break this down into a sequence of events to clarify what I'm describing  Typical process with current behaviour:  1. Open Google search app from home screen  2. Enter a search (optional) 2a. Perform any amount of navigation within the search app such as opening a link, navigating to another page from that link, etc  3. Navigate to another app or to the home page via any means (home button, recent apps screen, etc)   4. Open recent apps screen  Result: search does not appear in recent apps approximately at least 90% of the time, thus erasing any work done within the search app  Partial unsatisfactory workaround:  5. Click google icon in suggested apps if it appears  Result: search app usually reopens showing results for previous search (step 2) but not any pages opened or navigated to from those results (step 2a)  Normally this issue is only a minor inconvenience but at times it can be very frustrating. For example if I search for a website in order to log into a portal of some kind where I need to enter information, I can search, click, log in, enter information, all within the search app, meaning that if I were to navigate away to check an incoming notification midway through say filling in a form for instance, all of my work would be lost   So basically I'd like to know a few things, if anyone here can help me out at all  1. Is there any way I can make the search app consistently show in recent apps  2. Are other people seeing the same behavior  3. Is this intended behaviour  I'd like to add that I do know that opening pages from search results as new chrome tabs is in some sense a workaround but this requires a lot of extra navigation and also is an unintuitive step that has to be remembered each time without any prompting so I haven't found it to be a very practical solution. I'm also aware that it's possible to avoid using the search app entirely and rely on search within chrome but that takes away a lot of convenience features   Thanks in advance for any help you can offer",androidsever,17onkil

He then launched the web browser, which is when she grabbed it back.  The guy then RAN to the bathroom and locked himself in.  She has since factory-reset her phone, but I'm still concerned.    tl;dr: WTF",androidsever,2w2qka

"Power usage: Bluetooth vs. phone speaker Can anyone explain the power usage between Bluetooth speakers vs the phone speaker?  My phone is getting older, and the battery holds less charge, and I've been looking for ways to maximize my battery life.  I listen to a lot of audio for long periods of time. One thing that I have noticed, and I'd like to confirm, is that my phone lasts considerably longer if I use Bluetooth speakers or headphones instead of listening with my phone speaker.  That seems counterintuitive to me. Speaker components use very little power. And, I assumed that creating and transmitting signal via Bluetooth would require more power.  Or, is my experience just anecdotal? Maybe an idle phone on Bluetooth doesn't trigger other apps to wake up and check things, where the phone speaker indicates the phone is active, not idle.  Edit: I'm using a Samsung S9. But my question is not intended to be specific to me, but how Android manages power in general.",androidsever,tn8po2

"Corrupted Android OS every 3 to 4 months no matter which Android phone I use (tired of factory restore) Hey everyone,  I've posted this twice on Google support forums, asked my friends that work at Google, asked T-mobile employees, everyone I know, etc. Hopefully I can get an answer.  No matter which phone I use, it becomes ""corrupted"" and starts glitching in different apps.  The biggest noticeable difference is the battery. The phone will be completely dead in about 4 hours with normal use. AFTER FACTORY RESTORING, the battery will last 12-16 or longer under normal use.   Most of the time this happens right after installing an app from the Google play store. Last time it was Tiktok.  A big noticable Glitch this time is the trying to reach 100% battery. I leave the phone charged and 98% is the highest it will reach. The phone shows that it is charging, but won't ever reach 100%, no matter how long it is on the charger. I unplug and plug back in and sometimes after that it will reach 100.   Also I have noticed that certain random apps will not open from the notifications pull down menu when they previously did before this problem. I now have to open them from the app drawer or other location.   What exactly happened to my phone?  How do I fix this without formatting?  How do I prevent this in the future?  If anything, my friend that works at Google tells me that this is not common. This has happened to most every Android I've had, so please correct him.",androidsever,eu04j3

This doesn't bother me, but my teenage daughter is claiming that she is constantly left out of group chats because they can't add her android phone to the group chat, or that it doesn't work for some reason when they try.    I have no way of testing this out, since as stated, I have no Apple devices at home.  Can anyone here a) validate that this is indeed a problem, and b) offer any solutions that might help?

"Android 7+ has made recording internal audio while recording your screen nearly impossible. Does anyone find that strange? I was thinking about recording a bit of high-def gameplay today, so I hunted around for a screen recording app. After finding one I liked (just the plain old [Screen Recorder]( I realized that I wanted to record internal audio too, for shits & giggles.  Back in the Lollipop days, you could easily... well, fairly easy record internal audio while recording the screen by rooting and installing an app like SCR. I tested this a few years back and it worked like a charm. I believe this method still works on Marshmallow.  If you're on **unrooted** Android 7+ and newer and you don't have an LG, Samsung, or MIUI phone (since these phones somehow support internal audio recording via specific apps like Mobizen or the MIUI screen recorder app), you're out of luck. [You could also buy this headset and use it with a Mobizen app]( A ""world first"" that shouldn't even have to exist!  Why does Google refuse to let us record internal audio without jumping through all these hoops? [iOS 11 makes it super easy. And it can be done natively, without jailbreaking!](  So on Android, if you're unrooted, you absolutely need the right hardware to record internal audio and your app, unless you can somehow downgrade your phone to an older version of Android... just for internal audio recording.   If you want to record system audio and video on Marshmallow and under, all you need to do is root your phone and get [SCR from XDA](   You'd think Android, considering its reputation as an open and free platform, would allow native internal audio recording and screen recording at the same time, but instead Apple has taken up the cause. The same company that removed the headphone jack from their phones. smh. 🤦   Also, I'd like to hear any other solutions to this quandary, if there are any for us non-Samsung and non-LG plebs. Here are some solutions I found myself:  Apps|Potential Issues       :--|:-- [RecMe]( + [internal audio plugin (root)]( require you to flash your ROM and re-root again (after app updates?). **Needs root**. *[See this video]( the app + an Xposed module (installed automatically). **Needs root**. May not be a viable option for you if your game detects Xposed. [Github]( I'm worried that Google might remove it at some point because it *may* violate Play Store Terms & Conditions. This dev has already had apps removed from the Play Store. :( [Record audio directly to your PC via a loopback audio cable and Audacity]( you to sync the audio file with your captured video file (AKA time and effort). **Does not need root**. The MIUI Screen recorder app reportedly captures system audio and system video together.|**Does not need root**. **MIUI ROMs only**.   **If you guys could test these software solutions on 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, and 9.0 and post your results here, that'd be great. Thanks.**  *So the app mentioned in this video is actually a Chinese app that also has an English version on the Play Store. The creator of the video mentions that you have to install an Xposed module for internal audio recording (r_submix) to work in that app. The Xposed module should install automatically if you have Xposed and the app running. [Apparently it works with Magisk too, according to this guide]( Can't find the module though.  The Chinese version of the app is called ""屏幕录像+"" (literally just Screen Recorder+). The Chinese APK isn't available to download freely. The CoolAPK store (all Chinese), where the dev also posts (in Chinese), contains an additional app that [I uploaded here...]( This is also by the same dev. It's in English, BTW. Requires root.

OnePlus is a company from China? Why don't people look down on OnePlus like everyone does with Huawei? I see people say bad things about Huawei but literally nothing for OnePlus.

"Why aren't phone manufacturers making metal or plastic phones anymore? I absolutely detest glass-backed phones. They look beautiful the moment you take it out of the box, but the moment you touch it it's covered by fingerprints. You basically have to constantly wipe them clean, or have them in a case. There's also the case with scratches and cracks. Two years ago that was a problem only on the screen side of the phone, now you can get them all over. They are also super slippery, so you basically have to use a case on them so they don't slide off of the table, into outer space if it's windy outside, or out off of your pockets when you sit down.",androidsever,9brzad

Galaxy S20+ / Android 10 / OneUI 2.1  When I take a screenshot, and then try to crop it, a faint purple box shows up where it auto-detects lines in the photo and the crop edges ""snap"" to those detected lines, making it incredibly difficult to actually crop how I want to.

"Best USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter? A few months ago I finally had to trade in my old s9 for an s22 and by far the biggest drawback is the lack of a headphone jack since I rely on my wired noise cancelling headphones daily. I've gone through a few adapters already and all have had serious issues or broken after a few uses. Two were from Anker and both would randomly blare loud static and needed to be held at a certain angle to work which was disappointing because I've gotten good Anker cables before, and most recently I got the google one as recommended by another post but after only a few uses it's stopping my music randomly for no apparent reason.

Sorry, I don't know a whole lot about how Android differs from desktop Linux distro's (I'm sure it's a considerable difference), but for people with older or underpowered hardware, desktop Linux is a godsend.

Is such a thing possible with Android? It seems that even Cyanogen (which is pretty close to stock) will slow down an old or underpowered device pretty hard - for instance I bought one of those $50 Amazon Kindle's and put CM on it, and the thing absolutely chugs. The operating system itself is too much for the device, and I honestly just want a version of android that has the latest security patches, has the latest kernel and OS version, but none of the fancy graphical shit that slows it down so much.

However, given that our sidebar states ""For any and all questions regarding the Android **mobile operating system**.""

I mean really when you get past the specs all that's left is the aesthetic and the manufacturers skin, both things that are best decided by personal choice, which one do YOU like more? These days there are very few handsets that are incapable in the hardware department anyway and it's becoming more and more about personal choice, whatever you pick, the chances are it will be half decent, I mean there's the SGS3, the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 4, the LG Optimus G, the HTC One, One X, One XL, etc, hell, even the latest ZTE devices have at least a dual core CPU and a Tegra 2.

"Facebook Messenger is not sending me notifications appropriately. Samsung galaxy S20fe  For the last 8 months or so FB Messenger app is very inconsistent with sending me notifications.

It has no notifications for messenger listed either on the lock screen or in the notification panel. I open messenger and sure enough I have missed messages that I didnt even know that I had.

"Google Assistant and ""mistress"" what is up with that? I had a couple of entries in my contacts for my wife, one as the ICE contact and another just with her mobile number.   Every time I try to use google assistant to send a text or make a call, I keep having to choose from the 2 contacts. (I have since learned the correct way to deal with this, but bear with me.)   In an attempt to avoid having to choose each tim, I thought I would rename one of her contacts to Mistress.   After I did this, if asked the assistant to call or text mistress, it would just look up the definition.   So I changed the contact to ""My Mistress"" , when I asked the assistant to ""call my mistress"" it now brought up the correct contact but would not dial it. To check, I asked to call another contact in my contacts and it put the call straight through.

To clarify, the indicator only appears after I say ""Hey Google"" even though it should listen to me all the time. Although, I don't really plan keeping this feature on, I'm just testing it out.

"I'm getting tired of Apple iPhones and I want to transition to Android. I have a few questions. Hello! I've been using Apple iPhones ever since my dad bought me my first phone as a gift over 7 years ago, and I never thought of transitioning. I've always been satisfied with Apple phones, until recently. Being a Windows user I'm getting tired of the way they handle photos and music files, and I don't like that iPhones don't have 3.5mm audio jacks, among other annoyances.  I'm thinking of transitioning to Android in the future, but I have a few questions before I do this.  \- What should I know before transitioning? Do Android phones have quirks that I should be aware of?  \- Do all Android phones have 3.5mm audio jacks, or are android phones also following the same trend as Apple by removing this audio jack?  \- Overall, is Android a reliable OS compared with iOS?  EDIT: thanks to everyone for the helpful answers!",androidsever,madsze
"Where does AT&T get their cheap ""own brand"" phones? Who actually makes them? I needed to buy a cheap AT&T compatible phone fast on Wednesday because my  Moto X4's power port appears to have fried itself.  I ended up buying a phone that called itself an [AT&T RADIANT core]( As I expected, the performance is not great and every part of the phone that clan be made of plastic is made of plastic. The phone is both thick and heavy by 2019 standards and the bezels around the 5.5 in display are huge.  The power/sync port is Micro USB. What do you expect from a $35 smartphone.  Nevertheless, it works to make calls, Reddit, and keep my life organized while I deal with the extended warranty on my Moto.    &#x200B;  Curiously,  the battery on the AT&T store brand phone is replacable!  &#x200B;  Of course, the phone is made in China.  &#x200B;  I was wondering if anyone on this sub had any idea of who made this phone, and whether it's strictly an AT&T model or if it's a rebranding of a phone intended for the Chinese domestic or African market.  &#x200B;  TL/DR: bought a cheap crappy smartphone want to know who made it",androidsever,dqb3y9

"Strange giggling sound coming from Galaxy S10+ Like the topic says, I've heard a faint giggling sound coming from my S10+ a couple times today. It happened once while I was briefly on the Tumblr app and again I believe while I was on Chrome. There was no indication from the notification bar indicating which app it could have potentially come from and it only lasted a second or two, so I didn't have the time to screen record it.  I tried researching the potential cause of this and found a small handful of similar posts from the past decade but no real diagnosis of the problem or solution to it.

"Mom was told her phone will stop working next year due to network upgrades Hello All, My mom got an email from ting stating   ""The four major US carriers are shutting down their older networks in favor of newer LTE and 5G networks. Your phone (the ASUS ZenFone 3 ZE552KL) lacks the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technology to make calls over these networks. As a result, your phone will begin to experience issues such as dropped calls, failed connections and general poor call quality. It’s unlikely that your phone will work at all on any major network after the end of 2020.""  Is this just saying only one feature will stop working and thats it? She should be able to still make calls using regular cell signals right? Also general cell data should still work right?

"Found a folder containing recordings of me saying ""Hello?"" and ""room noise"" I was digging around in my Samsung Galaxy S7 to find old files to delete, and stumbled across a folder called ""audio"" in my phone storage. This folder contained several files, labeled like ""Hello"" or ""Hello-hello"" with some random characters / date etc appended on each file name. Each was a different clip of me saying ""Hello?"" or ""Hello?... Hello??"" (labeled appropriately), obviously recorded from when I had answered the phone previously. There were also a couple files called ""room noise"" which is just a recording of background like fans running etc.  I know from video editing that you use ""room noise"" to fill in background sound when you are cutting together audio, it makes it sound more natural because you don't notice the edited clips cutting off abruptly. This is really suspicious, it seems related to the scam that was going around recently where scammers would call you with a recorded voice saying ""Hello??"" as if they have a bad connection, to trick you into saying ""yes?"" so that they can then use your recorded voice to authorize changes to your accounts.  I'm not sure how far fetched that is, but I can't think of any good explanation for these recordings. My understanding was that this type of scam call would originate from the scammer's phone. But it seems very much like something is going on where my phone has been used to place this sort of call directly. Does this mean my phone is compromised? Has anyone else had this happen? I searched Google but mostly found articles about Siri or Google Voice storing recordings of voice commands, which this is definitely not. I have never used any voice command services on my phone.

"Why does YouTube keep auto-linking/streaming to our LG smart TV? It's such a privacy risk (NUDE MODEL PORN ALT BREACH) So this morning I was browsing Reddit on my porn alt, and one of the subs had a video of some Chilean nude models, which obviously caught my attention. I use boost for reddit and any YT link usually opens in app, which is fine, but I accidentally clicked the YouTube button and it loaded the YouTube app. No worries I thought; until I switched back to this account, started browsing through normal stuff then noticed a YouTube notification to ""resume playing Chilean nude models on LG TV"".  Now that I've got your attention, as they had mine, how the hell do I turn this off? Just, you know, given that my mother was in the living room watching TV with my NIECE while  my phone was trying to link with it (the youtube app loads, full screen). FFS this is a complete breach of porn alt and I need to resolve it.   I've checked the YT history and it seemingly didn't play, but I bet it said something along the lines of ""Chilean nude models - connecting with smartphone OnePlus 6 blah blah blah"" but my mother didn't click connect. My niece hasn't seen anything, she would have mentioned it straight away, but my mam probably did.  Anyway this has happened many times with more innocuous stuff i.e not the many and wonderus nude model models of Chile and it's irked everyone for a while because it just takes over whatever you're watching and brings up the YouTube app.  Now for the technical details: OnePlus 6 phone Android 9/Oxygen OS LG Smart TV with YouTube app/latest OS & app To be fair it happens with any android phone/tablet in the house if you accidentally click the button.  I can tell that it's linking because we're on the same WiFi network so it assumes it's okay,  but it's such an annoying and obvious privacy/security/porn alt breach, especially given I can't find an option to prevent linking with the TV anywhere on the phone or the TV.  But surely there must be a fix given the problems this could raise in shared accommodation etc when you're all on the same WiFi network and numerous phones/TV's could be connected.  So any ideas?

"[ SOLVED ] Finally I found a way to TOTALLY disable Bixby button. YES!!!!!! The most annoying thing about all Samsung's new devices is that unnecessary Bixby button.  Honestly i don't like Bixby because i think it's just not good enough to use it, BUT !!! I do like Bixby Vision it's really helpful sometimes especially when i need to extract some text from a picture, that's why I  don't want to disable Bixby services totally.  Yes i know that we can remap it using some third party apps like bxActions, but the problem of accidentally  pressing that damn button is still there.  The option to disable Bixby button is still there in the Bixby settings but these settings are just hidden, So i figured out a way to totally disable it using an app called (QuickShortcutMaker) you can download it from Google play Market:    Yes i know we still need a third party app to disable it but we need it JUST to find the hidden Bixby settings, after that you can freely delete it and forget about it forever.  So here is how to DO that:  1. Download it from Google play.  2. Open the app.  3. Choose Activities (its chosen by default).  4. Search for Bixby in the search bar.  5. Find and Click on the ""Bixby Voice"" activity.  6. Choose the first option ""Bixby Voice sittings""  7. Tab on TRY !!!  It will open the hidden Bixby sittings, under the ""General options"" you will see the ""Bixby Key"" tab on it and choose ""DON'T OPEN ANYTHING"".  ............ Bixby button won't disturb you any more.  It works perfectly for me on my note 8 !!!!",androidsever,9htip1

"How to prioritize one Wi-Fi network over another? I would like to know if there is an app for or feature in Android that allows Wi-Fi network prioritization. Basically, I have two Wi-Fi networks. One of them is unreliable with no data caps, the other is reliable with a data cap. I want my Android device to connect in a way that when the unreliable network stops working, it immediately disconnects from that network and connects with the reliable one. And when the unreliable network comes back, it disconnects from the reliable one and reconnects back to the unreliable network.  I learned about [Speedify]( but I would like a free solution if possible. I also read about [Wi-Fi Prioritizer]( but I don't know if it prioritizes having connected and having Internet over connected but not having Internet (as opposed to stronger vs. weaker). I don't want it to keep connecting to the data-capped network just because it's stronger, I want it to connect until the other more prioritized but unreliable non-data-capped network comes back to function.

"Samsung Internet opening to random spam sites Edit 3: The culprit has been found. The app peel remote (installed bt default on samsung devices) is the cause of the pop ups, disable/uninstall it and you will be fine.   Over the passed few weeks I've had random blog style websites (getfitnessinfo, thisdaythatage, some paWhat ge about the history of uber) opening themselves in the default Samsung Internet Browser. It mostly happens upon unlocking my phone (galaxy s6) but has also happened once while I was using it.  I have cleared all data on the browser app, uninstalled all mildly questionable apps (I hadn't downloaded any apps around the time this began), cleared the cache of my phone in safe mode, installed a custom firefox (that is meant to intercept spam sites and print a log file that shows what app is causing it) and set it as my default browser (samsung internet continues to open anyway with the sites), ran multiple antivirus apps (norton, avast, kaspersky, malwarebytes, ccleaner) and none have turned up anything. I've even gone through my files and deleted any data/app/sdk files I don't recognize or that seem suspect.  While the websites being opened do not seem malicious in nature, this has become very annoying both with the spam itself and the fact knowing something is buggering my phone. I have searched and tried multpile solutions to similar problems to no avail.  Does anyone have any ideas what could be going on?

"Working on an ""Android Academy"" for total newbies. Up for taking it for a ride? Been working for some time on a lil' [self-contained educational website for newbies to Android](    I remember when I first got my Nexus 4 a couple years ago. I still cringe at some of the seriously low-level errors I made because I just didn't know any better, like having a video Skype call over 3G (... yeah, you only do that once) and searching for ""cool apps for Android"" on Google.   Everyone knows the Play Store isn't any help, and most of us end up needing an answer from a real person, which might be reddit or might be that techie friend everyone seems to have.   As people get to understand their smartphone, their needs start to diversify, and they start getting into actual ""app discovery"" - which is more or less what I do for a job as an app reviewer/journalist. But at the very beginning, everyone's needs are really similar, stuff like learning how to install an app, how to add contacts, how to connect to wifi, etc etc.   My original idea was to design an app that somehow comes pre-installed on Android devices, and walks you through the basics of how to use your device, letting you leave when you wanted and come back to it whenever you had a question. It could also recommend you apps based on what your friends use, what's popular locally, or even using other kinds of algorithms according to what's on your device.   I have zero knowledge of app development, however, so to start I made this site with a bunch of GIFs along with a co-worker of mine. It's just a beginning stab at the idea - I know there's a ton of potential content that it doesn't have yet, and the design needs work. But, gotta start somewhere!   If you're a newcomer to Android, or you know someone who is, it would be invaluable to me if you could give it a whirl and let me know how you think it could be better. I already know I want to include more specific app recommendations in each page. What else do you see that it needs? Is it useful? Would you use something like this? Would your grandma use it?

What I care about is why it sends so many notifications when its not running lying about what will happen if I dont turn it back.  &#x200B;  * Phone Won't Work unless you enable google play services  Phone works just fine. I have noticed no difference in my ability to make/receive calls  * Messages won't Work unless you enable google play services  Messages works just fine. I still receive messages. I still send them.

"By how much do custom roms really extend Phone lifespans? I've been looking into replacing my iPhone 6, and thinking about getting an android phone to save a few hundred bucks here or there, versus paying $650 for an iPhone 11. I know about the SE2 and the battery just sucks, not really considering it. My iPhone 6's battery turned to shit sometime around year 3/4 causing lots of issues (<1hr screen on time in ~year 5 now lol).  What has prevented me from using android in the past has mainly been a concern over the longevity of devices, since I like to keep mine for ~5 years.  My understanding from my own research is that after project treble, custom roms became a lot easier to build, and while qualcomm doesn't provide firmware updates, you can still get android security patches.   I'd just be interested in hearing people's feedback with custom-rom friendly devices (like pixels for example). I'm particularly interested in hearing about people's experiences with things like Safetynet (using banking/payment apps with custom roms+Magisk), and if things became a headache (battery/perf/stability/functionality issues) past year ~3 when official support dropped. For example, I probably wouldn't be willing to reflash my phone with a new rom every month etc...  If it matters, the phone I'm considering is specifically the pixel 4a or the pixel 3a if the 4a flops on launch or something (I'm limited to Verizon/CDMA phones).  Thanks",androidsever,gdq2rc

"Need someone who's good at Snapchat. It's gonna snitch on me. Hi all.   I've been using Snapchat for about two years, and the other day an old fling of mine messaged me through the message option. Now I had no idea there was even this message option available, I thought the only method of communicating was through selfie's, but anyway we ended up having a pretty big conversation catching up on old times.  Now this conversation has lasted a couple days with a lot of back and forth, and snapchat being a total narc has gone and put a love heart next to her name when you go into my contacts.   Now my girlfriends coming to visit me in a few days, and she's pretty fond of going into my phone and sending stupid-ass snapchats to people.

"I'm blind and want to change text-to-speech engine on latest Amazon Fire HD8. The modified settings app does not allow this. Hi all,  &#x200B;  I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but it seemed like a good bet.  &#x200B;  , I use VoiceView (the screenreader that speaks everything I touch) on the Fire tablet. I have the play store, ADB, etc. Amazon's settings app only allows you to choose from the Ivona voices like Salli and Joey. There are a ton of alternative and much better text-to-speech options out there, and I can use these with any app that allows me to change the speech engine internally, but I can't change the default system voice to a third-party one, and therefore I can't control what VoiceView uses.  &#x200B;  Basically, I need some way of changing that setting even though the settings app doesn't show it. I assume this would either be done through an alternative settings app or some kind of ADB command. I've spent a while looking for ways to do this and have come up empty, but maybe I'm just googling the wrong things.  &#x200B;  I have access to Windows (and Mac, though that doesn't seem to matter much), and have the same level of screen-reader access there through software called NVDA. I've used ADB for other things and know enough to follow command-line instructions, but not much else. I may update this with other things I learn, but any suggestions would be appreciated. The only things I can find for controlling Android from Windows are screen mirroring apps, which isn't what I'm looking for at all.  &#x200B;  If anyone is wondering why I want to do this, I use a screen-reader to read and access my devices because I'm totally blind. Every operating system has something like this included now. The default Amazon voices are natural-sounding and generated from real human speech, which is great for reading books but not so much for navigating quickly. The large size of the voices makes them sluggish on the slow processor of the tablet. Also, I've trained myself to understand speech several times faster than normal. These voices have the option to adjust reading speed, but because of the way they're created, speeding them up degrades the quality of the voices and makes them hard to understand, as well as increasing the amount of processing and thus slowing down the tablet. There are synthetic voices such is the compact versions of Nuance Vocalizer, Eloquence from Code Factory, and the open-source ESpeak. These voices speed up much more naturally since they are simply generating the speech more quickly rather than modifying real samples to play faster, and they also react more quickly when I navigate the tablet, which makes a big difference to my ability to use the tablet efficiently. It's very disappointing that Amazon arbitrarily locked us out of changing this setting.",androidsever,bcujml

"What do I do about the porn stash? I'm a lifelong Verizon customer and a long-time Samsung user. On my Samsung Galaxy S8 I have hundreds of nsfw media files. I like to keep them hidden and separate from my sfw media files, so I used Samsung's secure folder feature, giving me a separate instance of any app I added to it. It was very convenient both for the gallery and other apps. I had messed up my screen and gotten tired of looking at everything through cracks and dead pixels so I decided to get a new phone. I was recommended the Moto G Stylus 5G and got it. But I didn't consider that I would lose access to Secure Folder. I tried the Google Files app's secret folder, but that puts every file in just a single folder instead of albums and prevents other apps from finding the files. As far as I can tell the closest thing I can get to it is using the Work Profile feature. The huge issue with that is you can't send files to and from the Work Profile like you can send files to and from the Secure Folder on Samsung. The workaround I found was selecting and sharing files from the Personal Profile to a file managing app in the Work Profile. First I tried [Total Commander]( but whenever I tried to share more than one file, it just gave error messages. Then I tried [Amaze File Manager]( and I didn't get any error messages but it didn't seem to do anything. After that, I tried [Index]( and [Ghost Commander]( but when I tried to share the files, they didn't even show up as choices.

So far, I'm thinking;  * Revert to older Cyanogen  * Underclock/undervolt CPU  * Lower resolution to 720p - maybe even go black and white?   What do you guys think?   EDIT : Running absolute base stock Cyanogen, used it for music all day, including FLAC audio, dropped about 10% - running excellent! No underclocking, just airplane mode and low brightness! Working great, recommend it completely. Only app running at all is music, no background apps no signal, etc",androidsever,3kemjl
"If your phone was tapped by law enforcement, Is it true that you'll get random intermittent feedback and echoes on calls? ( Please read full post before judging) I'm not trying to sound paranoid, But recently whenever I answer a call and say hello I can hear the hello clear as  day as if i'm sitting across from the other person. And throughout the call I will get random pop sounds, while the person is speaking And partial bits of what i'm saying through echo feedback. The person  I'm contacting never hears this, its just my end. Also, This even occurs whether im on handset or speakerphone..Everyone also claims i'm the only one who ever mentions anything like this while talking to them. I'm a verizon customer using a galaxy s21+ It randomly started about a month and a half ago, Interestingly enough this never occurs when talking to businesses/services And only occurs when talking to personal contacts. I have spent several hours both on the phone with technical support and in The Verizon store themselves and no one can make sense out of this situation. They sent me a replacement device, to which the same thing occurs And even tried putting my sim into a store device and the issue still occurred. I even tried using a t mobile e sim, with an entirely different number and the issue still continued. Verizon was even unable to issue me an esim. Or repovision my line. Due to an unknown error they were receiving. I am at my wits end because none of this seems to make any sense to involved and it's driving my anxiety up the wall.

"How to transfer files between two Android devices using a USB-C cable? I have a Note 8 and a Tab S7.  I've connected them via cable expecting one or the other to show up in the file manager like a USB stick. But this is not happening. I wanted to pull some files from one to the other. I do not want to sync it migrate all data between them.   Is this possible? I can't seem to figure it out and I'm usually pretty good at this. My Google searches are only giving me network options.  Thanks!  ==========================  Edit:  Figured it out on my own.  First thing I did was dial *#0808# which gets you into USB settings. Changed from MTP to PTP but I don't think this was required.  I think what actually got it working was once you connect the devices you get a notification pop up about a device being connected.  Tapping this brings up your USB settings (but a different UI than the dialer method). From here, on the device you want to act as the file host/USB stick, make sure control ""on this device"" is selected and ""file transfer"". Then disconnect and reconnect the cable.  At this point you may get prompted to allow file access on the file hosting device. Allow it. On the other device you should now get a pop up asking what app you want to use to open the USB device.  On the Note 8 to access the S7 Tab I had to use an app simply called Downloads. From here I was able to navigate the files, long press on a file or folder, use the menu in the upper right, and select ""copy to..."" and then select the folder I wanted to download that file or folder to. I also had to go to Optimize Battery Usage, All apps, and toggle the option on the app called Downloads because that kept stalling the transfer when I was either doing something else on the phone or the screen would turn off. That didn't seem to be a problem on the S7 Tab but maybe it's on a less aggressive power saving mode (my phone's battery is old and frail while the Tab is brand new). Even then, once it got to 0 minutes left the status didn't clear so I cancelled it and use the RAR app to check the MD5 checksum of both files to verify the file had transferred completely. If it fails and you restart it'll make a new file with an incremented file name unless you delete the old file first. Seemed a bit glitchy doing tablet to phone. Again, could be due to older software or power saving or something.   On the S7 Tab, to access the files on the Note 8, the app was called MTPHost. It looked the same as the one I selected on the Note 8 above and functioned the same. Actually, when it was open on the Note 8 the app title appeared to be MTPHost even though it was Downloads on the app selection screen.  Neither still show up in any other file manager I tried (Samsung File Manager, Total Commander, Xplore, B1 Archiver) but at least it worked. Gallery also worked on both but only showed images even though the videos show up locally in the Gallery app on both devices.  Thanks to everyone that actually tried to help instead of telling me to just use wireless.  Edit 2: I was able to get it working in Total Commander Android using the ""User-defined location"" option where I could select the connected device from the list of locations that appeared under that.",androidsever,xlox95

"Coworker’s phone was being monitored/hacked, got a new one and the same thing is happening Prefacing with I know absolutely nothing about android.   Coworker has been talking to me the past few weeks about her phone being hijacked/hacked/mirrored. I thought she was a bit crazy at first, and maybe she’s doing things and forgetting like turning on WiFi, Bluetooth, and other normal settings. I looked through it and didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. But she kept insisting. Then she showed me her chrome search history, and there were searches on her account from times she was asleep, or for stuff she would have absolutely no idea what they are, like searches for stack overflow programming. Kept getting some notifications or emails that games were being purchased.  She kept saying her tv/roku was being controlled and YouTube videos were playing on the phone and tv without her knowledge. Kept seeing the camera and microphone active. Even had a new email address with a slight variation to her original added to her gmail app.  I told her to reset the phone, she went to her carrier and they did it for her.   Couple days later it kept happening. So she went back and got an entirely new phone, cut service to the old number, made a new gmail account. Cut off her home Internet. Told me about it. She asked me to come take a look at her tv and phones. I checked out the old phone, which was reset. Checked the tv settings for changes in the internet connection and didn’t see anything. Everything looked normal. Then she told me all this started happening after breaking up with a boyfriend recently. Said she’d go on his phone and see her phone on his, her emails on his. Told me he’d always be messing around with electronics at her house, like going behind the tv. I checked for any suspicious cables but didn’t see anything  Then she came to me this morning saying it happened again with the new phone. She got locked out of her new gmail account. Kept getting notifications for game purchases, camera and mic activating. Settings turning themselves on and not being able to be turned off. Kept getting texts from a blocked number saying “it’s not me”, and “hope your phone is better now”. Saw somewhere that her phone model was changed to something different. Claims to have seen a mouse cursor on the phone. I asked her if she reused a password for the new gmail account, which she said no. The handle and password were both very unique and no one knew about its existence except me. When I was at her house, I asked her to say her email and password out loud, so I’m wondering if her house is physically bugged. But how can they continue to gain access to the phone itself?   I’m unsure of how to help her and I know it’s really upsetting her. I truly believe though it’s stemming from her phone and I just don’t know what it could be, because I’m largely ignorant as to what software and hardware can be used to spy/hack android phones, as I’ve always used iPhones.   On mobile and at work, so sorry if thoughts aren’t gathered properly. If anyone has any idea what could be going on, please share with me so I can try to help her out. If any additional information is needed, please ask and I’ll try to get an answer or be more concise  Edit: there was also mention of an “emulated” folder on her phone that had suspicious stuff (pictures of her phone iirc). When I went over to her house, she handed me a stack of papers she printed off about android security and hacking that she’s been researching to the best of her ability.",androidsever,ix1xxx
"What Have I missed (returning to android from apple) I was an avid android user back in 2012/2013 (Sony xperia).

However my family were big on the cult of apple and I ended up getting a few iPhones along the way (accepted them because why say no to a free and good phone right? Also made things like sharing chargers much easier)  Well folks I’ve gotten a bit tired of apples proprietary crap and have gone out of my way to come back to android. What have I missed since I was gone? (Moving from iPhone 6s to a mid range android). I’m already liking the fast charge, the mega sized batteries etc but what else?

"A small Google calendar tip that some may like (or not) I use Google calendar quote a lot, almost exclusuvely on my android phone and like it in schedule view so that details are always visible but when looking through the calendar and planning, it would be really useful to have all days visible but days will only show if you have an event, so it could literally skip a whole week or more when scrolling through. There is no setting to change this, but this is what I thought of to get around this:  Add an event for today, choose a drab gray colour and name it something minimal like a full stop, star or ""Just another day"" and then tell it to repeat every day with no notifications, and then you'll have every day of every month show in the calendar.",androidsever,hxv1uy

"PSA: Android 11, the gallery, and .NOMEDIA files **EDIT 5/5/22**: There is a much simpler solution/method/fix than that detailed below **that may or may not work for you:** rename ALL album art images to **folder.jpg. At the time of writing, folder.png images still showed up in the gallery - your mileage may vary.**  An easy way to test if this works for your device would be to create a new folder in the MUSIC folder, adding any image file to it that you want. Check to see if this image shows up in your gallery app or similar (I used discord's file upload). After confirming it shows up, rename this file to folder.jpg and refresh your gallery or other testing app - in my use case, the image disappeared but was still present in the folder. **note:** applying this fix in a folder that is NOT named Music does not make the system ignore those images.  I'm kicking myself for not finding this solution sooner, but hopefully one of these two methods will help someone. Not all media player apps can work around .nomedia files, after all.  &#x200B;  **Original Post Below.**  Hi there! This isn't a question so much as an ""answer"" - nobody had quite the whole answer to my problem, but after figuring it out I wanted to share the wealth.  After updating to android 11, my samsung galaxy a51 suddenly began showing ALL album covers from my music folder on my SD card. Odd, because previously I'd always used the .nomedia trick to make it ignore those images, and used a player that could in turn ignore the nomedia file. I don't WANT to sift through thousands of images so I can share a picture with a friend on discord, after all.  A few hectic hours of troubleshooting later, including using several different file explorer apps and my pc to try to create a new nomedia file in that folder (which had MYSTERIOUSLY VANISHED) it became clear that android was deleting the nomedia file and not allowing apps to create a new one. Why, I do not know. My fix was:  1. using my pc/usb connection, renamed the ""Music"" folder to ""My Audio"" (you can rename it what you want, but I'd suggest something that both makes sense to you and won't be something commonly used by the android system) 2. added a .nomedia file I copied from my mediaplayer's directory (i use BlackplayerEX) to ""My Audio"" 3. re-scanned my music library, verified my playlists were now empty (HECK) 4. backed up my playlist files to desktop (you're looking for .m3u files) 5. used Textcrawler to find and replace the directory information, copied them back to my phone, and then re-imported them into Blackplayer. Textcrawler can be found here, but it is not mandatory if you have a similar app or know what you're doing in this step: [ (**update 5/5/22: Notepad++ is able to ""find and replace all in all open documents"" - quite useful for this step and honestly just a useful program in general.)**  Was this an incredible hassle? absolutely. Do I hope my struggle helps someone? YES. From what I've gathered, this problem is affecting folks on various devices - not just samsung - but Android 11 seems to be the common factor. Other folks were apparently using .nomedia for their downloads folder (which at times can be nsfw or not something you want those around you to see) and I haven't figured out anything yet in that regard - your best bet might be to change the download location for certain apps, or start managing files in downloads and moving them to other uncommonly-named folders with .nomedia files in them. Good Luck!  (if this post belongs better elsewhere or needs flair please let me know and I will gladly move and/or fix it!)  EDIT: to anyone pointing out I can hide galleries or use a third party gallery app to exclude folders, this method **also prevents those album cover art images from showing up in other apps (such as discord or text messaging) when I want to share photos.** The gallery app by itself will not do that.",androidsever,odw2vu

"Receiving blurry, pixelated photos and screenshots through text I recently transferred from an Iphone to a Note 20. The Note20 is a carrier unlocked phone from AT&T and I currently have an unlimited data plan with Xfinity.  Recently I have been having an issue with receiving photos through text from anybody on my contacts. Any time I receive a photo or other mms, it is super blurry, pixelated and illegible. I have tried various things to try and fix this issue to no avail. Below are some of the things I have tried to test this issue and the results.  I have sent various photos of different file sizes to myself through text on both the pre-installed samsung messages app as well as using the Google messages app with RCS turned on. I have sent a photo with sizes 14kb, 128kb, and 365kb. I have sent these images both on and off wifi with at least 4 bars of 4G connectivity.   **For the Samsung messages app:** (*assume all images are either illegible or original image was unable to be identified*)  * The 14kb image was received as 12kb  * The 128kb image was received as 30kb  * The 365kb image was received as 29kb  After some additional testing it seems that images sent that are larger than 30kb get received as 30kb and images smaller are received at their original file size or a couple kb smaller and also the quality is diminished and pixelated even for the smallest of images.   **For the Google Messages app with Wifi \*ON\*:** (*assume all images are either illegible or original image was unable to be identified*)  * The 14kb image was received as 12kb  * The 128kb image was received as 27kb (This image took 18min to complete sending) * The 365kb image was received as 25kb  **For the Google Messages app with Wifi \*OFF\*:**  * The 14kb image was received as 13kb  * The 128kb image was received as 28kb * The 365kb image was received as 366kb the **very first time** ONLY. Any subsequent images were received as \~28kb-30kb.  This was something strange that happened. The very first image sent with wifi turned off (the 365kb image) was received as 366kb and also retained its original picture quality. This image had perfect clarity and was received as intended. **Since the image was able to be received as intended on the largest image, this suggests that it is not a compression issue with the image being too large for the network**, but rather something else causing it.  However any image sent thereafter was again received completely pixelated and illegible following this pattern of approx. 30kb.  **Other methods used to try and fix this issue:**  1. Cleared cache for all apps through the software. 2. Reset all network settings. 3. Force reset of the phone 4. Cleared cache for all apps through android recovery  *\*All image tests were preformed again after each of these were completed with similar results.\**  **Conclusion:** As you can see I am pretty determined to try and get this resolved. After all of the troubleshooting I have done, I have not been able to fix this issue or replicate the singular time that the image was received without any defects. I do not know what is causing this issue or why I am unable to receive photos, videos, or other Multi-media messages without it being blurry and pixelated beyond recognition. This issue is very annoying as I frequently am sent images from friends, family, and co-workers, although now I am unable to see what they are. Since I do not use any form of social media I do not have any other way for images to be sent to me other than e-mail which has issues of its own with a major factor being the inconvenience.   I hope someone can help me resolve this issue before I decide to return the phone. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   Edit: I appreciate the suggestions and comments and would like to say that I am aware of the differences between imessage and android, as well as the limitations with mms. However I would like to reiterate that that this is an issue when images are sent TO me, but they appear perfectly fine on other phones (both iPhone and android) when they are sent FROM me. Additionally if the mms system were the cause then it would only affect images that are TOO LARGE to be sent without compression as opposed to all sizes. For ex: the size limits before compression takes place on AT&T is 1mb, Verizon is 1.2mb, and Xfinity  600mb, these are all about double the size of my largest test images. Also if the mms limit were the issue then it should affect the resolution of the images equally upon sending and receiving instead of only receiving them. Friends and family of mine are able to share images among each other with both android and iPhones without the resolution becoming destroyed in the process to the degree all of mine are.   Again I don't have any social media except reddit so I don't have any other method for people such as my mom or grandma who dont have emails to send me images other than through text. No fb messages, snapchat, instagram, whatsapp, etc.  Edit 2: I have now tested this on other 3rd party apps, Whatsapp, go sms, Verizon messages +, textra, and telegram. All of which had the exact same issues with blurry pixelated incoming photos of about 14kb-30kb in size. I am beyond frustrated  Edit 3: Old post but for people who come across it. The filesize of an image directly correlates to image quality (higher resolution images are larger files.)   However, other than using the Verizon messenger I don't think there is a fix  it has to do with an incompatibility between the 2 companies. (Something to do with the cell towers using different antennas in the phone) What I ended up doing was returning the phone and I bought a different factory unlocked one.

Perhaps you will have better luck than I.  There was a time when one could simply bring up the network settings, select the desired wifi network and bam. Done. No more.

I got a new phone (OP7 Pro yes its lovely, thanks) and as a treat for my 9yo and a reward for good schoolwork etc I factory reset my old phone (OP5), took out the SIM card,set him up a child Google account managed by Google family link and thought all was cool. His content is restricted and he has to ask me to install anything at all.  Today his mum let him take it to holiday tennis camp. Surprising but whatever. His mates have them and he will only be allowed to use it in the breaks.    This evening he said to me ""daddy theres something I need to show you... If you go here (Google photos) then here (device folders) then here (downloads) there's a video of a woman touching her vagina. I don't know who she is though""  Oops.

"What's the deal with Google Now's voice commands? Voice commands are driving me crazy! I tried using Google Now's voice commands to see when my Dentist appointment is, as I had entered it into Google Calendar weeks ago and I couldn't remember the exact date and time. First I tried saying this: ""When is my Dentist appointment?"", which Google translated to text as ""when is my dentist appointment"" and responded with a Google search of useless Dentist-related youtube videos and Yahoo Answers links.I noticed that the speech-to-text failed to end my question with a question mark so I added it manually, making the Google Now search now read, ""when is my dentist appointment?"". It responded with the information I was looking for: the calendar event including date, time, and location.  I was always impressed with Google Now's voice commands, but this was a huge let down. I explored deeper. Get this: for some reason I decided to try speaking ""when's my dentist appointment"" and guess what, it worked! Google still failed to add the question mark but it gave me the response I expected: the date/time/location of my appointment. I repeated this test several times and was able to repeat this behavior again and again. If I use the contraction ""when's"" instead of ""when is"", Google gives me the right answer. If I ask ""when is"", it gives me useless web search results.  Can anyone explain this to me? Am I missing something? Should I open a bug ticket somewhere or is this intended functionality somehow? It seems like such a silly bug for such a great and powerful system. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

"Google Play: False DMCA Complaints ruin lives of developers I have been developing apps for Android for years now. Last 4 years I started receiving DMCA complaints regarding my apps. Recently, I have received another one. When I read complaint details it was always suspicious for me. Just a small investigation always showed that these were false complaints. As I see it is really easy to fool Googles' complaint system and remove apps from Google Play. In my case, it is a guy who registers domain names including the word ""copyright"" and sends DMCA complaints using email like [legal@blablacopyright.com](mailto:legal@blablacopyright.com) to Google and impersonating officials of the Blabla organization and saying that my app ""kind of"" using their copyrighted data and have to be removed. The strange thing is Google is just accepting such complaints without detailed checks or asking for a copy of some identity. I sent a detailed explanation to Google proving that this is a false complaint but they don't care. They follow DMCA complaint procedure and ask me to fill counter-notice form.  When I send them counter-notice, Google is forwarding it to the original complainant (which is stupid because this individual fake and complaint have no value) and I have to wait 10 business days to get my app reinstated. But, this fake complainant is doing his best to extend my app reinstatement so just replying to Google that ""he is willing to take a court action"" and here we go.. Google refuses to reinstate my app. Before that individual didn't know about it and my app was reinstated in 10 days but now he learned that he can just reply that to Google. This is very annoying because Google is just believing to mail reply that this guy sends every time but not reading and seriously investigating the facts I sent them.

"Does anyone know of an app that makes my phone FUCKING RING when I have a reminder? Simply put, calendar is stupid. My institution uses G Suite and I've just missed the 4th meeting this month. People create meetings using calendar, everyone is automatically subscribed and gets a reminder set for them on their associated account.  The problem is that when the reminder is triggered, the phone doesn't ring, doesn't vibrate, just silently shows a notification.  I tried manually changing this configuration but I found out at most I can change settings for notifications to override DND if it's enable, and I can manually change settings so that my phone always vibrates when I get the notifs, but still it never rings, so if I'm away I miss the reminder altogether.  &#x200B;  PS: plzz don't BS me with stuff like ""you gotta be responsible, bla bla bla"". I have at least 7 meetings a week, there's no way to keep track of all that and Calendar was supposed to handle that, but it doesn't.     EDIT:     Okay, I found out there's plenty of stuff going on here:, here's what I found:  1. As I suspected, the Google Calendar's ""Settings > General > Notifications"" takes me to the OS's notification interface. That exact same menu can be accessed via phone settings    1. As a result, what you see there is provided by the OS, so I think it will vary from phone to phone. Here there's simply no ringtone setting there at all 2. If I go to settings > notifications and apps > Google Calendar, I can set a ringtone for that app specifically 3. However, I made a few tests and found out that Google Calendar reminders/events are handled by the Google app instead  4. Under the Google App notification settings there's a channel for reminders, one for task reminders, and such and such    1. By changing the ringtone for those, I got what I wanted: the phone fucking rings when I have a reminder 5. The notification ringtone simply won't play, at all, if the phone's screen is on. That means, even in the lockscreen (at least here). 6. Google sucks and I'm getting a 3rd party app anyway, this shit is just a huge dumpster fire.",androidsever,psrr35

"Is there any way to lock the battery gauge to full or disable it altogether? (rooted) For reasons I won't get into in order to avoid a longer post than necessary, my phone runs from an external battery bank based on 18650 cells with its own charger, and it specifically cannot charge from the phone's built-in charging circuit (stock battery was LiHV 4.35V, external is LiIon 4.2V - if I charged it through the phone it'd get overcharged).   This hack works great and the phone lasts forever and a day even under heavy usage, but the battery bank's onboard charger screws up the battery gauge - the phone doesn't know that the battery is being charged, and will cheerfully report it as 1% charged even as the voltage goes up to 4.2V.   In and of itself this wouldn't bother me all that much as I can just run a battery voltage monitor and figure out how much capacity I have left from there (and I never really run out anyway), but some applications such as the flashlight think that the power is critical and refuse to work properly, or set themselves to annoying powersaving modes. I also get a blinking red LED which takes priority over the blinks I get from notifications, and occasional popups warning me that I need to charge NOW!!!!.  Annoyingly this behaviour resists reboots and the gauge can only be reset by physically unplugging the 18650 cells, plugging them back in and jolting the battery circuit back to life by briefly plugging in the USB lead (otherwise it won't work at all).  For these reasons I'd like to disable the gauge completely, or hack it to be locked to full.  I'm rooted and have experience with the terminal. I don't have XPosed installed now but I can install it if need be.  I went poking around into /sys/class/power_supply/battery, but everything in there seems to be dynamically altered by the battery's ""fuel gauge"" chip and I get access denied errors if I try to manually modify the files - even as root, which struck me as quite weird.  Any ideas? I tried Googling but all I get are useless articles about user-level ""hacks"" to improve battery life.",androidsever,aq6gh9

"Help try to save my marriage? ""X computer is attempting to connect"" My wife says that her android phone displays messages indicating that several computers in our house are attempting to connect to her phone.  She indicates that this means that I am trying to track her somehow.  She says that my daughter also receives the same message on her phone.  One of the computers is supposedly mine (it is connected via Ethernet), even though the name that is given is not the hostname assigned to my computer.  The other computer that supposedly attempts to connect to her phone is named ""hplaptop"".  This morning I was throwing out computer names and she latched onto that name as one that she has seen before, too.  So, on one hand, my computer is displayed as ""blhblhthrow's computer"" when its actual name is ""dualcore"" whereas the other one is called ""hplaptop"" which is its actual name.  I have checked my router and there is nothing defined as ""blhblhthrow's computer"" on that device.  Wireless devices are blocked unless their MAC is in an access list.  We have four phones, two tablets, a chromebook, a Blu-ray player, and a laptop that use the wireless portion of the network regularly.  The only wired devices are my computer, an xbox 360, and a printer.   I am not trying to track my wife and child.  I have no idea why they are getting these messages and I need to figure it out.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  EDIT:  I will do the following:  1) Reset the password on my router AND the WAP2-PSK key.  2) Run a Live-CD virus/malware scan  3) Disable all file sharing and streaming applications.  4) Show them how to get a screenshot of the message if it shows up again.  5) Turn off Bluetooth on the laptop.   Edit 2:   I am downloading the BitDefender Livecd.  I have changed the WAP2 key and the admin password on my router.  Hplaptop does not have a Bluetooth device.  Media Streaming is already turned off on dualcore. No wonder my xbox couldn't find it!  Edit 3:  BitDefender LiveCD found absolutely nothing.  No infected files, no suspicious files, no I/O errors.  I will see if I can get them to give me a screenshot, because I have not seen this error message and I use a tablet every single day.  I have a cell phone that I use as an mp3 player while I am at work or working around the house.  I have never seen an error message like the one my wife described on that device either.  Edit 4:  I set up IP reservations for the two phones in question.  I then installed Wireshark and set up a display filter using ""tcp and ip.addr==192.168.1.2 && ip.addr==192.168.1.241"".

It's been in the backseat of my car this whole time. SO sorry."" Anyway long story short, I actually liked this girl.

"What's the status on Android performance degradation in flagships phone? Backstory is as follows: I always bought bottom-mid range Android phones (Around 200-250 euros) that I would change once every 18-24 months.  Now, my Huawei P Smart from 2018 is starting to slow down after some 15 months of usage and that reminds me of the feeling of having a slow phone for six months to a year and I don't want to experience that anymore.  When I'm looking at my girlfriend that has been rocking iPhones her whole smartphone life, she's only had three phones in ten years: A 4, an SE and now an 8. She kept her SE for what felt like forever (4-5 years I want to say) and I remember the phone not feeling sluggish at all before she upgraded.  The reason I'm bringing this up is that I don't know how much of the degradation in the performance of my devices is due to me ""cheaping out"" and not buying a 600-700 euros phone once and keep it four years or Android being less optimized than iOS.  So here I am, ready to spend money. Looking at Samsung S10, Huawei P30 Pro, One Plus 7 Pro, ... And iPhone 8 Plus, and even iPhone 11.  So here is the question, considering my needs here, which is to have a phone that stays fast for four+ years. Should I spend more money on my phones or switch over to iOS?

Will Google stop giving Android and services to the Chinese? So I have some stories about tension between The West and The East in terms of Android. (Looks like Fallout type of cold war is coming again!)  Is this a sign of Android being banned from Chinese devices?

"Google is denying me on a massive refund because of some very strange events I am being denied a refund even though I am the person who placed the order and owner of the google account the order was placed on because someone fraudulently initiated a transfer of ownership posing as me.  I recently posted an add for trading my pixel where someone asked for my invoice information in a trade for his Note 9. Naively I gave it to him. He stopped responding and deleted the log afterwards. I did not thing much of it as nothing happened to my account except I saw a support case opened. However some trouble started when I tried to start a refund for my devices.  Google is saying if I do not know the email name ownership was transferred to there is nothing they can do, despite the fact I have all 8 devices, the ID and Credit Card as well as live at the residence of the order placement. Nevermind that my email is the initial one used to place the order.  Google has refused to help even though I am in possession of all ordered devices and everything needed to prove I am who I say I am.  Due to this I will be likely out of 1000s of dollars.  I have contacted UPS who will pick up my pixels and return them to the sender after which I will contact my bank to return the funds.  However I am worried if I do this I will be out both my phones and my money if things do not go right.  I cannot reiterate how shocked I am at the callous and careless way I have been treated by the support throughout this ordeal.  I am almost in tears and have never felt so powerless.

"Why is my game getting popular in China? I released a free Android game in July of 2016 called ""Dust Bunny Sweep"". It saw relatively mild success on the Google Play store and close to no downloads on the Amazon app store.  Recently I've seen a couple of huge spikes in China. It's getting 2000-5000 new players a day, and none of them are going through Google or Amazon.  What I know:  * First spike happened Jan 5th and fell off after the 19th. * As of Jan 31st I saw a second new surge of users. * They are almost all Chinese and on Xiaomi devices. * They look like normal users (dropoff rates, play time, etc.) * They are playing the initial release apk which was replaced on Google and Amazon in August 2016.  The game is free so I'm not losing any money, but I'm really curious where they are coming from. I have tried googling a bunch, but nothing I've found looks like it's getting this much traffic. Does anyone know a good way to find out? Does anyone know of any Chinese services or social media posts that might lead to such a spike? Or is there another explanation?  Thanks.",androidsever,5ry41y

"Best Buy left their SIM in my phone So I recently bought an Xperia Z1 from my local Best Buy store, it was discounted as it was a display model. It's been in the box for a while as I thought I'd give it to my girlfriend after she came back from vacation, but while she was in the US she picked up an HTC M8 for a decent price instead, so I thought I'd use the Z1. I took it out of the box, turned it on, and noticed that it was running on Bell, connected to voice and LTE, but I hadn't put my SIM card in yet.   I looked inside and yep there was a Bell SIM in there. I tried calling the house and it came up as a 647 (Toronto) number while I live in Calgary, so I assumed that this was the SIM that they were using in the phone while it was a demo unit. It's been off the shelves for a while though, and on top of that it spent 3 weeks after I bought it in the box, wouldn't they have thought to disconnect the service by now?

"My Note 3 was stolen by some douchecanoe on a bike. What steps can I take on my new device to prevent such an inconvenience from happening again? I was walking home from work after an overtime shift and not 3 minutes from my house my phone was snatched from my hand as I was browsing the 'net. Fucker had cycled up behind me all sneakylike and gassed off after making the snatch.  After giving chase and giving up due to the sedentary lifestyle IT work can bring, I returned home to fire up Android Device Manager and called the police to report the theft. Unfortunately, the device had already been turned off so I was unable to locate, lock or wipe the device. I've called my service provider and cancelled the sim and locked down the IMEI, but according to the police, the common practice from thieves is to power down the device, move it out of the country and then sell it, circumnavigating both the location services as well potentially IMEI lockdown.  I'll be picking up the Moto E 4G, as hopefully having a cheap and cheerful device will make me less of a target.  What software and/or hardware can I use on this device to help protect me from thieves who want to steal my cherished devices?  Other than being streetwise, not being glued to my phone whilst walking out and about and advertising myself as a target, what other steps can I take?

"""How do I do ____ like I did on my iPhone?"" - A Guide This is in response to many threads asking this question. Please let me know if I have any information wrong or if there's anything I should add to the guide.  *Music*  This is a big concern to almost everyone switching from iOS to android. There are a few different ways you can get all of your iTunes music onto your android:  1. Plug your phone into your computer via USB and drag your iTunes music folder into the phone or the SD card. When that’s done, you just take out your phone, launch the music player, and all your music will be there.   2. Use Google’s music service. Get Google’s [Music Manager]( and upload your iTunes folder and any other mp3 folders you may have. Get the Google Play Music app on your phone and you can 1. stream your iTunes music from the cloud 2. download your iTunes music to your phone via Google Music.  3. Use Doubletwist player. I don’t have any experience using doubletwist, but it works on the same principle as Google Music. Install [doubletwist’s client]( on your computer and doubletwist’s music player on your android, and you can sync your music, podcasts, videos, etc. over your wifi network.    *Group Texting and iMessage*  Group text messages work in the newest version of android (4.2), and older versions of android can sort of handle it, although there are a lot of problems with it. iMessage, however, is locked away by apple, so no one can build an android client for it. So the short answer is: group texting works, iMessage doesn’t.  *Siri*  Google introduced Google Now in android 4.1. It's a lot like Siri in that you speak into your phone and it responds. You can ask it for the weather, sports scores, and nearby places, just like siri. You can also use it to give you phone commands like ""open Temple Run"" or ""set an alarm for 5:30 AM."" The coolest thing about Google Now, however, is its card system. I'll use the weather card as an example. When you open up Google Now, it automatically brings up a [card with the current weather and a 5 day forecast]( for your location, without you even asking for it.  [Here's a Google Now vs. Siri video](  *Facetime*  The best two alternatives to facetime are Skype and Google+ Hangouts. Skype is a free video-calling service that runs through a Skype account. Google+ hangouts are run through your google account and are great for video-calling with multiple people at the same time. President Obama uses them for his ""fireside chats"".   *Other apps*  There will usually be an android version of any iOS app you want in the [Google Play Store]( If not, you can usually find a different app with the same functionality to replace the app you’re looking for. I rarely have trouble finding the equivalent android app for whatever I just installed on my iPad.",androidsever,1cke02

"How to retrieve files from protected /Android/data/ folder I've been playing [Kotor1]( on Android and loving it so far. Alas, the app's cloud saving feature has been broken for the past 2 years, and I want to preserve my savegames (and also transfer them to the PC version eventually).Apparently, the game's save files are in the /Android/data/ folder, and for the life of me I haven't been able to access them. Android 14 puts up a whole lot of security around this folder, and I looked for many online guides on how to bypass them, but nothing worked for me so far. Anyone has any suggestions?  Note that I do not wish to root my device.  &#x200B;  EDIT: I managed to fix the issue using the following steps (very similar to standard Shizuku method, but with a twist):  1. Install Shizuku 2. Install Zarchiver 3. Connect Shizuku with Wireless debugging and give permissions to Zarchiver 4. Go to Zarchiver settings->ROOT, make sure that ""Type of root access"" is set to SU (or whatever the standard is on your phone, as long as it's not Shizuku). 5. Access the desired folder in /Android/data/ (in my case it's /Android/data/com.aspyr.swkotor/) 6. When you get to the ""You must choose a path to...."" message, hit Cancel and STAY on the screen of the desired folder (you'll see no files and a message ""Access is denied"") 7. Go to settings (from within the denied folder), and change the type of root access to Shizuku (enable the other toggles, ""use for android\[data|obb\]"" and ""file operations"") 8. When you hit the back button you'll find yourself in the desired folder. Note that if you accidentally move back to the parent folder while still with root access type of Shizuku, you won't be able to find that folder anymore (unless you switch out of the Shizuku access type setting again)",androidsever,1ax0tmb

Wifi Calling Breaks When Using Local DNS Decided to give Pi-Hole a try and found that everything worked apart from wifi calling on my Pixel 3a. Tried the usual things and resorted to packet capture on my AP and discovered something pretty weird. The phone makes the DNS request but the Pi-Hole never receives it because the destination MAC address is set incorrectly (the gateway MAC address).  In this instance the gateway is a Juniper SRX firewall ([192.168.1.254]( Android device is [192.168.1.132]( and the Pi-Hole is on a Raspberry Pi with address [192.168.1.1](   Here's a screenshot of what I see in Wireshark after rebooting the phone: [ The source and destination IP addresses are correct however there's that weird difference in destination MAC address.   I've worked around the issue by adding a secondary IP address on the Raspberry Pi in a different network (192.168.2.1) so requests to it need to go through the gateway but seems like anyone that's hosting a DNS server on their local network which isn't on the gateway will suffer the same issue.

"Should I get an Android phone with 128GB or is 64GB enough? **Update**: Thank you to everyone who took time to reply. I read all the comments even if I didn't respond. That being said, I decided on the 128GB version. Originally I was leaning towards the 64GB because I figured it would be enough with how I use my phone, but as someone pointed out, it's a pretty small margin for a price difference and considering the points some of you made about the new changes coming to Android and how they would affect storage, I figured this was one of those times when spending a few extra dollars made more sense than saving them, especially since I'm hoping to get at least 2yrs of usage (definitely wouldn't complain if I got more) out of the phone.

I had a battery problem with my S8 where it won't turn on, and I have warranty so I am just getting a replacement. However I have to send me old one in to get refurbished, and I'm just a bit paranoid about sending in devices with data that I haven't wiped myself.  When they replace the battery and get it to work, they'd have no real reason to but could they look at anything that's on the device before resetting it?  Just a data paranoid person, that's all.

Disabling the camera removed the camera app from the app drawer and prevented any further errors and no other apps seem to have been affected!  Thanks for all of the great tips guys!      Hi everyone,  My family uses Verizon and I am in search of an inexpensive smartphone without a camera or a new/used phone with cameras that are easy to remove.    My mom will be admitted to a live-in mental health facility for depression and anxiety treatment for a period of about 3 months. She is allowed to have a phone – including a smartphone, but for patient confidentiality it cannot have a camera.   My options are:  1)     Buy an inexpensive phone like the Moto E4 or E4 plus and remove the camera myself. I have replaced screens, speakers, and batteries on my own phones like the HTC One so I have faith I can do this myself.  2)     Buy a used “higher end” smartphone that for $100-$200 that is a couple of years old and remove the cameras.  3)     Buy a smartphone that does not have a camera. I see that these exist but are probably hard to come by and/or too expensive.   My questions are:  1)     What option should I go with? Does anybody have any recommendations for phones with easy to remove cameras that are hopefully attached with ribbon cables and zif connectors and not soldered to the board?  2)     Software wise, I think the phone should work fine and just maybe display errors occasionally about the camera not being able to initialize, correct? Or do I need to focus on finding a phone that I can easily root and remove the camera app? Is there anything else software wise I should be aware of?  Thanks for help!",androidsever,9gnoa5

"Android users of Reddit, what are the top benefits of switching to Android from iOS that you can think of? Hello Android users not sure if this is the right sub, but this is technically an Android question so here goes.  I currently own an iPhone 6s Plus through the carrier Sprint (which includes unlimited data) and I truly love it. Its screen is beautiful, the camera is great, and I use 3D touch constantly. However, since iOS 11 was released I have had so many issues with it that I am seriously considering switching to Android instead of selling an organ on the black market for an iPhone X (which I have played and thought was great). This is because I know that Apple will put out another update in two years that will ruin the next phone I get.  So instead I am considering selling a kidney for the Samsung Note 8 in the coming months which I have played with in store and find it to be a joy to use. However, I didn't have all day to play with it and some of the stuff I imagine I could do with Android would require downloading things which the store demo didn't allow (to an extent).  Basically I was hoping to get some help from this sub from daily Android users to finally get me out of my iOS shell. What are some basic things that you guys think is a good selling point that advertisements haven't shown off and what are some things that the more tech savvy users of Android can do?  For more info, I do not own an Apple computer, I use Windows everything except for an iPad. I am also a senior in university so anything you may know that is helpful for college life or soon to be working life is much appreciated.  tl;dr Tell my why you like Android and would never switch to iOS?",androidsever,7dqkza
"Help, my correct password is (still) not being accepted after an update, I can't access my phone. So here goes, I just installed an update. For a few weeks, maybe months, my Samsung Galaxy S7 didn't unlock when I typed the correct password, thus I then had to access it via fingerprint (this was out of the blue, it had always worked before *it didn't work anymore*. I don't think there was an update inbetween, I checked a day ago and had 7.0 installed).   How do I know my password is correct?  * The first thing the phone requests when it boots again is my personal password, I put it in and it is accepted and correct.   Then I type my SIM card PIN as requested. Now generally even after reboots I was able to then unlock the phone via my fingerprint but not this time.  Screen reads (and offers the keyboard, roughly translated, I'm German): >Your device has been rebooted and has to be unlocked via your password. You will be able to use your fingerprint to unlock your tablet next time. ^Your ^password ^has ^to ^have ^at ^least ^4 ^symbols, ^including ^at ^least ^one ^letter.  And here it fails, it is not being accepted even though you can be absolutely certain that it is correct.  I had also already tried to change the password several times (before the update) with absolutely no luck. After a few ""false"" tries it shuts itself down for several minutes  I've read this and that and a factory reset is absolutely no option.  Do you guys have any idea why this happens and what I could do? It really is important. Thank you in advance.  Edit: Restarting again did not help.  Also I don't have that findmymobile thing/Samsung account.   ______________________________________________________________ **EDIT^2 : I GOT IN. HERE IS HOW:**  * Completely shut down the phone.  * Poked the little cap and took out the SIM card (and my micro SD card).  * Booted phone on, only had to type my password which worked. I have full access.  -> This time I did only have to input my SIM PIN but not the password *again* directly after.  * Switch screen off (side button). Poke little cap.  * Put SIM card (and micro SD) back in. Switch phone back on.  * Screen locks and asks only for SIM PIN. Input SIM PIN.  Unlock and access phone. :D  ___________________________  I can still neither change nor disable my password as it is being recognised as incorrect in the settings. Will attempt to use Find My Mobile now to reset or change the password from a computer and will report back.  __________________  **EDIT^3 : Password reset worked!! (might be the only thing you have to do, but at least you can do the first thing (Edit 2) on your own without another device/computer)**  I saw I already had a Samsung account but my passwords are on my phone so whatever.   * I went on findmymobile.samsung.com, then logged in there (also had to put a new password *there* for the Samsung account).   * Then had to accept the stupid terms there, located my phone (probably not necessary) and clicked on the tab on right that said ""Unlock my device"".  * On my phone a notification said ""reset lock screen"". And now I have no lock screen lock/request at all and can set a new Pin/Password/Fingerprint/....  AWESOME!  _______________________________  I don't want to ask for upvotes, it would still be nice if you guys could make this visible in case other people need this solution, too.",androidsever,6et1x6

"Why do companies like Vivo, Oppo, even make their own UIs? I never understood the actual reason behind it. Why do they spend time and resources into rewriting the same thing that has already been designed, that too when the end result is worse than the original AOSP one.  Vivo and Oppo phones UI is just a cheap, knock off of iOS UI, which is also arguably worse in terms of UI than the original android UI Itself. Samsung's OneUI is still somewhat original and does not look like a cheaply made garbage ios clone.  However, some companies like Samsung still make a good alternative to the default android UI.  But still why do they do it? From a profit perspective, it just costs them more money and resources when in the end they are just redoing what has already been done, in a worse way (Except few ones like samsung). Why cant they just ship in stock android without their skin? It would cost them lesser money and wouldnt it increase their net profit? by not having to manage a team that just does the same thing again, in a worse way.  &#x200B;  I remember using my grandma's vivo phone, and i was so disgusted by it. It was so badly designed, that just clicking anywhere on the screen would give you a 'button click' sound like on android. the UI itself is very clunky and slow, and is just a rip-off of iOS.  note: i am not talking about the bloat that some manufacturers ship with their phones. you can still ship bloat features an app, WHILE adhering to the stock android UI",androidsever,orgz6k

"How often do you upgrade your phone and what do you look for in an upgrade? One rule of thumb I learned is that Android phones get 2 generations of OS support and additional 3 generations of security updates. I, however, think that based on hardware advancements and software development, phones last a bit shorter in terms of specs and support. Though I do think this rule differs across phones. While the flagship Snapdragon chips are expected to support more OS updates, midrange chips for me don't seem like they last long. I had a phone with a midrange MediaTek chip - while it was blazing fast during its first days, it became super sluggish later on.  Do you upgrade your phones often or do you stick to one device as long as possible? I think upgrading from a flagship doesn't happen often since you already have the best of the best, but does the same apply even for midrangers?  And, if you want to buy a new device, what feature would be worthy of an upgrade apart from specs? Having more cameras seems to be a trend, but if there's one thing that should be customary on phones is higher refresh rates - only gaming phones have those, but they are not as popular as the famous flaghips.

"As someone who has been using iOS for years, I'm currently VERY intrigued by android and would appreciate if someone could clear some doubts/concerns most people like me have Hi guys, I'm a jailbroken iPhone 6S+ user. I'm currently a slave to Apple's ecosystem (iPad, Apple TV, Watch but not a Mac) I apologize for the wall of text below, but I know you guys are always glad to give a helping hand.  I've been using iOS since the iPod Touch 2G, taking a break for a couple months only in the Galaxy S3 days, which was my first and only android experience. Many iOS users are in the same boat as me.  Android was a whole different thing back then. Nowadays, when I see the curved, bright and saturated screen of an S7 and how well it pairs with the material design, I feel like I'd love to give that a spin. My problem is that I've been fed constant complaints on behalf of android users, using different handsets and at different times. Here are my main concerns:  * **I've always heard that, after a ""honeymoon"" period, almost without fail, *all* android handsets start to experience stuttering, freezing, rebooting, framerate drops, etc.** (maybe one of those at a time, sometimes all of those are common occurrences) does this happen? This is the most important one for me, because if there's something that none of my iPhones ever suffered from, was reduced performance.  * **Software glitches which are mostly hardware-specific.** I've visited the 6P subreddit, only to find a plethora of people complaining about the camera app freezing or crashing, some focus issue I believe as well, or maybe just reduced performance in other parts of the OS (which is the purest form of android). I've also heard that Samsung's bloatware, although only a fraction of what it was back on the S3 days, still causes the phone to feel sluggish at times. Haven't heard about Huawei or HTC bloatware, but I have watched reviews which mentioned some lag here and there.  * **Software updates.** The whole ordeal of having to choose a phone thinking about whether it will get updates in the future or not is pretty sad. I know that Nexus phones are guaranteed to get updates for two years I believe, but as I stated before, visiting the 6P subreddit, I've seen people complain about Google updating the OS but leaving bugs unresolved for several iterations of it. How do you handle this when choosing a phone?  * **Customization.** If there's one area that I've been always convinced Android was leaps and bounds ahead of iOS was this. However, as a jailbroken iOS user, I find that I get *most* of what you guys can get out the box, but in a prettier package. As in, jb tweaks are very tightly integrated and always match the OS look and feel. In Android, you work with apps or, after rooting, with ""modules"" I think they're called. How do these differ from JB tweaks (stability-wise as well)? How different is the process of waiting for root vs waiting for a JB? Is rooting as necessary as jailbreaking?  Lastly:  * **Apps.** I am aware of the differences in general app quality when comparing the App Store and the Play Store. Big names such as FB, Twitter, Instagram, etc are mostly the same. But when you start digging a *little bit* deeper, you find that there's a big difference in not only availability, but also variety and polish. At least, that's how my experience was and what I tend to hear from Android users. How's the Play Store these days? Has this changed a bit?  I apologize once again for the wall of text. If you could answer each point with one or two lines I'd be immensely grateful. Honestly, since these points are big question marks in my head right now, I wouldn't even know what handset to look into, because I don't want to be unpleasantly surprised later on. Android screens though... Damn. Most of them are sexy.  Anyway, thank you very much for your time. Any help is deeply appreciated.",androidsever,50o8oe

"So I just switched from iOS to Android. I want to fully utilize everything there is to offer. Help me? Ok guys, I don't know if you allow these types of posts, but here goes. I've had iOS for about 5 years, and I have gotten extremely bored with it, so I decided to step out of my comfort zone and get a Samsung Galaxy Note 4!

I never had any idea how deep the customization went, and while I do love it, I want to make sure I'm working with the absolute best apps I can work with. Here are some questions I have:  1) What is the best app for SMS/MMS texting? I am currently using Textra, and I like it, but I have run into a few issues sending photos and videos to friends. Also, most of the people I text are using iOS, is there an ideal app that makes it easier to communicate with those users?  2) The Launcher. This is one of those things that I have no idea was customizable with Android. I am currently using the default one, but I am very curious about others. One of the things I really liked about iOS was how they displayed notifications on the lock screen, it was simply a straightforward list and you could simply swipe form the lock screen to return a call. This is a feature I am missing with this phone and am curious on how I can get it back.  3) My final question is simply what else? What are some of the awesome features that Android has that I need to explore coming from iOS?",androidsever,2ksx6z

Ironically, the tables have turned, and for those not paying attention, Authenticator Plus stopped its development in 2018. It probably went unnoticed by many who relied on it for potentially hundreds of MFA codes.

"Did I just install a virus APK? *facepalm* (Literally created an account just to ask this) Ok so...I think I messed up a little bit...  I was downloading an APK from Apkaward (a site which I find pretty reliable), but in the process I accidentaly clicked the wrong ""Download"" button and didn't notice (the APK had the name of the game I was trying to download so it wasn't obvious). I downloaded it and went to install it and...well, I did a couple of really stupid things... like, REALLY STUPID.  The APK's icon was white and had no name but I still went to install it thinking it was just a glitch (Dumb Move No.1). Then my phone alerted me that this app was probably bad and that I shouldn't install it. I have seen a fair amount of the ""This file might be dangerous"" alerts in the past, but this one was a completely different one that I haven't seen before, telling me that I reaaallyy shouldn't install this APK. A very obvious red flag...I ignored (Dumb Move No.2). Then I think there was yet another alert which I again ignored (Dumb Move No.3) and then the app asked for permissions. This time, I wasn't dumb.   The app asked for three permissions (I don't remember what they were) and I instantly went to deny them. When I tried to deny the first one, I got an alert that this app was for an older Android version and that denying this permission might mess with its performance...but I didn't really care, so I denied all three permissions (or at least I think I did? I am currently having the ""Did I lock the front doors? I remember locking them, but dID i ReAlLy?"" fear, but that's just paranoia and if I am not demented, I definitely denied all three permissions).  Then the app opened, told me that it was for an older version of Android, and crashed. At that moment, my brain finally picked up on all the huge red flags and realised that ""Hey, maybe I screwed up!"". I looked for the app on the homescreen but I couldn't find it. I immediately googled which android antivirus was good for scanning phones and curiously enough, the first one I found a good review of was this ""Mobile Security blah blah blah"" by Trend Micro on Play Store. So I downloaded it, scanned the phone and voila! It found the no-name-no-icon app and I uninstalled it immediately. Then I proceeded to download a couple of different antivirus apps (mainly AVG and Malwarebytes) and scan my phone with them and everything seemed fine...  However, I read that phone antiviruses are pretty bad, so here's my question - Is my phone safe now? Is there a chance that the no-name-no-icon app did something to my phone in the very brief period of time it was installed? What should I do?  I have a Xaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro, it is fairly new (3 months old) and it has Android 10.  Another thing that basically pushed me into making a Reddit account and making this post were permissions. I read somewhere that a virus can't really do anything on an Android if it doesn't have permissions. So, I went to permissions manager in my phone settings and found a creepy inconsistency. When you go to the permissions manager, you get the menu with all the various permissions. Under every permission you have ""X out of Y apps allowed"". I manually went trought all the permissions and I noticed that under the ""Physical activity"" permission it said ""1 out of 2 apps allowed"" but when I checked, no apps were allowed this permission and one was denied it! (the denied one was Google Maps). The same was true for ""Location"" and ""Storage"", but in their case the number of allowed apps was the same, while the overall number of apps was different. I don't know if this is just a glitch, but it got me paranoid so here we are!  So...that's all. Somebody please help!  (Obligatory ""I'm not a native-speaker so if I butchered something, sorry!"")

"RE: Do IMEI repairs actually work? So four months ago I posted(on an account that is now suspended) here asking [Do IMEI repairs actually work?](   I went ahead and purchased it for my Galaxy S9.  Communication was done over WhatsApp. Initially the seller told me that they would have to carry out the service later that night or the next day. A few hours later they messaged me back with instructions that included changing developer settings and connecting the phone to a internet connected computer. After about 45 minutes, it was done. I reverted the settings and factory reset my phone(with the line of thinking that if a factory reset would revert the repair I'd find out now and not be stuck months later after I had forgotten about the possible ramifications) Not backing up WhatsApp was a lack of foresight, as I could have referenced the chat to give a bit more detail here. But that chat is lost to the ether now.  Four months later my phone is still working and I'm happy with my purchase. I'm writing this because when I was making the decision to hand over $100 to unblock my phone I couldn't get a straight answer to whether or not it was a real, viable option, or if it was likely a scam. So for any considering such an option it seems (in my case) to be the real deal.   If you didn't read my initial post, let me tell you what brought me to this purchase. I didn't steal a phone(practically speaking. Technically I did - I guess) My sister in law had her phone stolen. She filed a claim with her cell provider, paid a $400 deductible, and the phone was blacklisted(unbeknownst to her). The phone was later returned to her, after she had already received a replacement. When my S8 crapped out, she offered me her (blacklisted)S9 — for free. I found out it was blacklisted, she then filled me in. She tried calling the cell provider to have it removed from the blacklist, they referred us to the insurance company that did the blacklisting. The said to either destroy it or send it back to them, but no they would not remove it from the blacklist.  Not wanting to do either of those(Thus technically theft) I looked for other options including replacing the the logic board about $300 I think. Or this repair service.  Now it's a pretty sketchy service in my mind. I had to not only hand over C$100 but also essentially full control over my device to a stranger via the internet and communicate via a E2EE chat. I could have easily lost that money and had malware installed on my device, or data stolen. Luckily that wasn't the case.  If you find yourself in a similar situation and want to take the $100 risk, I'd recommend you wipe it before and after. This way your data isn't on the device to be stolen and hopefully any malware that may have been installed is also wiped.  Should this IMEI become blacklisted, I'll update this post.

"Does newer versions of Android consume more battery and CPU than older ones? Let's say I have 3 devices (some 2016 flagship) with same hardware running Android 6, 8 and 10 and the official support for device has ended at 6. If through other measures I update to other listed Android versions, would I see improvement in overall battery consumption and better performance in games like PUBG or would that have the opposite effect?  I've seen a lot of people saying their device doesn't last as long after their update to newer Android version. Is it really the case? Is there any comparison of Android versions that I can see because I couldn't find any. I am really curious about this.

"[Xiaomi Mi 5S] Overcoming the flashing red light of death Hello there,  My Mi 5S is going the way of the Dodo. First the screen died (actually, it might have been a battery problem even back then that got misdiagnosed by the technician, who proceeded to fuck up the screen, but that's besides the point).   Then I started using the phone through the PC (Win 10) using a software called Vysor (authorizing USB debug using ADB console without access to the screen was straight up black magic). The phone was ""working"" ok (made calls, ran apps, etc). Then I proceeded to fuck up again and let it discharge under a critical level.  Right now, here's the status:  - If I connect the phone to the PC, It gets identified correctly (Mi 5S) for 5 seconds, then reboots. Sometimes it reboots to being identified correctly and booting again, but it always ends up being identified as ""Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008"" and stabilizes like this;  - If I boot into bootloader, it gets Identified as ""Android"" and I can access the phone using fastboot commands (but not ADB commands);  - If I try to boot into recovery, either manually or through fastboot, it doesn't get recognized at all.  In all those cases, the charging light stays off. It also stays off when trying to charge using an outlet. Here are the ""fixes"" I tried to far:  - Leaving the power pressed while charging. With that, the red led blinked dimly several times, then brightly several times, then stopped for several seconds, then repeat. I left the phone like that for about 6-8 hours, but apparently it didn't work.  - I disconnected the battery, connected the power charger using an outlet, then reconnected the battery.   The red led starts blinking consistently when the charger gets connected (even before reconnecting the battery) and it stops if I remove it before reconnecting the battery (which is expected, of course).  After reconnecting the battery, it keeps blinking; even after disconnecting and re-reconnecting the charger.   If I connect it to the PC while in this blinking state, it doesn't get recognized at all.   If I power it ON, the light stops blinking, and I can't get it blinking again unless I repeat the battery disconnecting > reconnecting  process.  So, Google tells me that the phone might be dead for good, and also that some people managed to get it back by letting it charge for a long time (even days).  So my question is: in which state should I be letting it charge? With the blinking light after the battery disconnecting process, in fastboot mode or completely off?  If you guys/gals have any clue to that question or about any other ""fix"" to this problem, I'd REALLY appreciate it, since there's a lot of stuff I need to recover from the phone, and I'm also missing some very important messages right now,  Thanks in advance for any help!  Edit: I haven't managed to get it working yet, but for those of you who stumble on this post, the method of charging that seems to work is this:  - Disconnect charger and battery; - Connect charger, get blinking red led; - Connect battery. - Disconnect charger. You should still be getting the blinking red led that is now being powered by the battery. - Reconnect charger. - Leave it alone.  You can measure if it's working by using the  ""fastboot getvar battery-voltage"" command. If it's going up, I suppose it is getting some charge, slowly but surely.",androidsever,gcpesi

"How to unpack and edit an Android Database file? Hi,  I'm just trying to get my data from an unrooted phone, then transfer it to another device.  Specifically,   I'm trying to preserve a call recording app. On the old device, calls   are stored on an SDcard, so the app looks there to enable playback. The   call notes and other details can be restored to the new device (also   unrooted) but playback of the call files can't occur. I opened up the   .ab for the call app in notepad++ and found amongst the jumble of data  some file directories associated with calls pointing to the SDcard. The  app doesn't seem to have a  way to reorient existing call notes to new  file directories, i.e. say 'hey call recorder app, you made some files  on this other phone, and I want to you recognize them'.  So,  I know in order to  transfer to a device without an sdcard, or even  with a different  sdcard, I need to edit the app files which dictate  where to look for the  call files.  I  used ADB to backup  the app files. I unpacked the .ab to a .tar and can  open it up in 7-zip.  So I have the .db files and other files. I was  hoping for something  easy to modify, just open up in notepad++, but  that doesn't seem to be  the case.  I've really wandered about trying to get this done. So I'd appreciate any advise.

I've found out that you can customize basically the Start Screen by using Launchers and Icon Packs, and i absolutely love it! But when researching that, and in general, i came across a few things i don't quite understand yet, so i think i'll find answers here.  \-Rooting: Is it same as Jailbreaking, where you lose warranty? I saw that quite a few Apps require a root... But is the System still as save and do i still have warranty should i decide to root it? Or should i just not root it as long as there's still warranty? Especially regarding Online Banking and stuff.  \-Ad Blocking: How do i block the entirety of Ads, including In-App-Ads on Android? This is the main reason i got an Android in the first place. It's absolutely vital for me to be able to block especially the YouTube Ads. I much rather support the Creators with a Twitch Subscription, buying Merch or so. But having 2 unskippable 15-seconds-ads before every video that are obnoxiously loud and overcompressed, just to have the Video interrupted by more ads every 2 minutes? Nah fam, not having it at all.  \-Not App Store Apps: So i've learned that you can download and use entire App Stores that are not the Google Play Store; and through them even more Apps. If you do that: Are you still safe? Again, especially regarding Online Banking etc. Are those ""Third Party Apps"" dangerous / can spy on ""Official"" Apps?  \-After official Updates: When the official Updates stop, i should be able to install the newest / another Android Version myself, right?  That's all my questions right now, i guess...  Thank you for your Time. :)",androidsever,e5xvf7

"Android vs IOS apps and UX - are the still many differences in ease-of-use and simplicity ? One of the claims I see sometimes on blogs is that IOS apps are more polished, or have better user experience.  But when I ask for examples about which apps and in which manner they are better, I don't see much information about it.  In the past, there were videos comparing and showing that actually Android is more convenient. This one is from 7 years ago, and shows quite a lot, in 5 parts videos:  [  Or [this one by XDA]( .  Some points remain today too (like the fact that IOS still can't allow to change default web browser), but less of them than in the past.  Some things I remember in the past:  1. IOS didn't have notifications. Instead it showed a focus-stealing dialog 2. IOS didn't have a nice sharing dialog. It could share with some apps and that's it. 3. IOS had a very complex and un-intuitive UX for the home button (it even reached triple tap, as I remember)  Of course, IOS also had some advantages over Android on some things, but things have changed for both OSs over the years, and in some way each reached to the other.

"Phone restarted on its own over night so alarm never went off. Stock alarm clock app on android 9 on a Cubot X19.  I set my alarm, went to sleep, woke up two hours too late to a rebooted phone waiting for me to enter my security pattern and pin after which it gave me a 'missed alarm' notification.  I already searched my settings for any sort of auto restart feature I might be able to switch off and found nothing of the sort  edit: Okay, so, until I find a better solution I've turned off my security features for now, so the phone goes right to asking for my PIN after restarting. That way, the alarm still gets through. Of course, that's not optimal (feels kind of like a waste to have a fingerprint sensor and not use it) and if anyone has a better solution I'd really appreciate it, but for the moment it's okay.",androidsever,o4y6oy

"Made a gmail account for a school project, it somehow took over my google account's old hotmail.com address as the primary address on the google account and can't be changed. Now I can't login to youtube vanced on my phone or access any of my locked photos and files. What do I do? I'll try to go to my account settings for the gallery's content lock or youtube vanced's login, and it says that my older hotmail address is already present on this device, but it can't display my files because technically a different google account is what locked those files. Reinstalling vanced won't even let me login at all now (it says there's a problem communicating with Google's servers when I try to add my account?), although the default Youtube app (filled with ads) still works at the moment and has me logged into it - that's not really a fix though.  &#x200B;  Because google is stupid this is basically leaving me with two options:  1: Somehow find a way to delete/disable the newer gmail account and hope it doesn't disable my entire google account and just reverts back to having my hotmail account as the primary address, which I assume will put things back to normal and let me access my files and login to youtube vanced. Looking around in google's account settings, it doesn't really look like there's a way to do this from what I can tell.  2: Remove my locked files from my phone onto my computer and find a way to unencrypt/recover them. Is there even a process or app I can use to accomplish this? If Option 1 doesn't work, are my files going to be lost forever?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. I work in IT and I can't even figure this out, this is ridiculous. Thanks google.  &#x200B;  EDIT: Managed to fix Vanced's functionality by re-reinstalling it.

"Android 11 bubbles not functioning? I have a Google Pixel 3 XL unlocked (on Verizon). I just upgraded to Android 11. I have the Bubbles feature enabled for my messages app, but I don't see the little button in my notifications to open them in a bubble. I also don't know of any other way to open conversations in a Bubble. I had my friend text me and then went into the notification settings for messages and set his conversation to always open in a bubble, yet I still don't have any bubbles popping up, nor do I have a way to open them. Is anyone else having this issue?  UPDATE: I factory reset my phone last night to see if it would fix the issue. Not only do I still not have Bubbles, I lost all of my messages from the last ~4 years and all of my settings. I actually had to reset twice to try to fix this, but it didn't work. I also worked with Google support, to no avail. I stopped using Sms backup & restore about three months ago because I thought Google was backing up my texts... So I thankfully only lost about 3 months. I am, needless to say, frustrated. Be aware, though, that if you don't have the Bubbles feature, factory resetting will probably not make it work :/  UPDATE: I just left and re-joined the Messages Beta. I now have Bubbles working. If you still don't have Bubbles and don't want to join the beta, you'll probably have them working in a little bit. If they're working in the beta, I suspect they'll be rolling out in an upcoming update.",androidsever,ip2pd3

EDIT- DO NOT DELETE /SYSTEM UNLESS YOU HAVE AN SD CARD WITH YOUR DESIRED ROM ON IT. IT WILL REVOKE ALL ADB COMMANDS AND WIPED STORAGE.

"Switching from iOS to Android My wife is doing what the subject says and I'm helping her. I have a quick and specific question that Google search doesn't seem to answer. And a general question asking opinions.   I've seen that there are a few ways to transfer data from an iPhone to an Android phone, in this case a Samsung. When using Google Drive, it looks like everything gets put into Google's ecosystem in the Android side. But I also see that Samsung has a ""Smart Switch"" app that does everything (presumably faster) over a cabled connection. My question is, where does the data land on the Android phone? Are there Samsung-specific apps that contacts, calendar events, etc get moved into? Or does it still use Google contacts, Google Calendar, etc? Or does it ask which app you'd like to import into?  Have you made the switch and, in your experience, what's the best way to do it?

"Crazy or not?: 32gb is not enough space for modern smartphones I have a Galaxy S7 with 32gb storage and an extra 128 gb micro SD card. I'm currently using 18gb of the SD card and 30.7 gb device storage. It seems like I'm in a constant losing battle to maintain space. I already have all my photos and videos and every single possible app on the SD card. I have a bare minimum number of apps and run CCleaner multiple times a day. No audio, video, images, or documents on the device storage.   The problem is the apps. All apps, system, bloatware, or other are around 20gb of space.   1. Only a select number of apps can even be moved to the SD card. Even then it's not clear if all the app's associated data moves there (e.g. Are audible books saved on SD card or device?)  2. This is a phone from the carrier and so between the carrier, Samsung, and google, there are a number of large bloatware apps I cannot delete.  3. There aren't many great resources on the increased size of apps over time, but I read [this article ]( claiming the top 10 iPhone apps increased 1100% in size from 2013-2017. I can't imagine that is different for Android, and at least 5 of those apps are ones that come w/ this phone that I cannot uninstall.
