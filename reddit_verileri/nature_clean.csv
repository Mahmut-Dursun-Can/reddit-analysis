"Brain implant translates thoughts to speech in an instant Improvements to brain–computer interfaces are bringing the technology closer to natural conversational speed.   A brain-reading implant that translates neural signals into audible speech has allowed a woman with paralysis to hear what she intends to say nearly instantly.  Researchers enhanced the device — known as a brain–computer interface (BCI) — with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that decoded sentences as the woman thought of them, and then spoke them out loud using a synthetic voice. Unlike previous efforts, which could produce sounds only after users finished an entire sentence, the current approach can simultaneously detect words and turn them into speech within 3 seconds.",doğasever,1jouf65

"First map of human brain mitochondria is ‘groundbreaking’ achievement Different regions of the human brain (artificially coloured) have different densities of the energy-producing organelles called mitochondria.    Scientists have created the first map of the crucial structures called mitochondria throughout the entire brain ― a feat that could help to unravel age-related brain disorders1.  The results show that mitochondria, which generate the energy that powers cells, differ in type and density in different parts of the brain. For example, the evolutionarily oldest brain regions have a lower density of mitochondria than newer regions.  The map, which the study’s authors call the MitoBrainMap, is “both technically impressive and conceptually groundbreaking”, says Valentin Riedl, a neurobiologist at Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen, Germany, who was not involved in the project.  From cell to brain The brain’s mitochondria are not just bit-part players. “The biology of the brain, we know now, is deeply intertwined with the energetics of the brain,” says Martin Picard, a psychobiologist at Columbia University in New York City, and a co-author of the study. And the brain accounts for 20% of the human body’s energy usage2.",doğasever,1jo3z81

"How the brain's little blue dot regulates your sleep We may also take advantage of the two-way traffic between the locus coeruleus and the body. The blue dot is part of the autonomic nervous system, which controls unconscious physiological functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. This is divided into two arms: the sympathetic nervous system, responsible for triggering a stress response, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which sets the body for rest and relaxation. And it seems that we can selectively activate each arm with different physical activities.   Moderate to intense exercise – walking, running, rowing, cycling, or boxing – is likely to kick the sympathetic arm into action, accelerating the blue dot's activity and increasing our mental arousal. That's great news if you're feeling groggy in the morning and need to wake up, but less useful when you're trying to calm your mind after a hard day's toil. You may think that physical exertion will tire you out, but if you're already having trouble sleeping, late-night gym visits are a bad idea.  Gentle stretching, on the other hand, can promote a relaxation response in the parasympathetic nervous system that simultaneously calms our thoughts and feelings. Controlled breathing exercises, such as pranayama – an ancient breathing technique that stems from yogic practices – appear to do the same job, with slower respiratory rhythms reducing overall arousal.   We can use this to our advantage as we wind down at night. Various trials suggest that meditation and mindful movements can reduce the time it takes to get to sleep, and improve our overall sleep quality, over and above the standard treatments for insomnia.   We do not quite have a physical switch that can turn down our mental activity at will. By managing our daily routine, however, and harnessing the mind-body connection, we will have a much better chance of getting the deep rest that we need.",doğasever,1igplzk

"Nature sucks Seriously, what is there in this world to ever be worth striving for. I don’t even understand the whole ideal behind staying alive, it’s disgusting. All those millions of years, for what? A dumb society where we still need to argue whether egg prices are too high or not, what a joke.   And what is with nature and reproduction, can’t life have some any other meaning besides sex for god’s sake. Women are in such disadvantage because of biology having a breeding kink. I don’t think you can put all the blame on patriarchy or men since women are inherently weaker, I just find that incredibly unfair. You can still have childbearing women even if they were equally strong.   Oh and I know some man will come up with the ‘women live longer’ bs, but who told you I want to live, let alone live longer. For the rest of the women, and men actually, I’ve seen the same thing. Tiring life with work up to their ass, no free time, barely anyone wants to stay alive anyway. Let’s not forget animals who are just killing eachother, with disgusting and disturbing societies just to reproduce and stay alive. I just hope there comes a time where not only humans go extinct but whole earth itself, full heartedly.",doğasever,1ipro1a
"Nature is sooo unfair to women!! Like literally, it feels like God or nature is against women, we have period every fucking month, we have to go through monthly symptoms caused by PMS that makes us go crazyyyy, we are the ones that have to carry babies and have to go through painful child birth and pregnancy, and after when our periods are over, we have menopause which AlSO comes with horrible symptoms that last for on average 7 YEARS, well men have it easy, they dont have periods, symptoms, pregnancy or menopause. But we also have physical disadvantages, like men are stronger and faster then us, if it wasn't for nature women weren't be oppressed, it fucking nature that did us dirty, society fucking hate us and so does whatever that created the universe and humans, I personally sometimes feel depressed and suicidal cus of the female biology.

"The Dodo bird and the breeding argument The most used argument against predator removal is that prey species will breed out of control and destroy the environment. Here comes the Dodo bird.  The Dodo was a bird species that enden on an island without predators. According to the beforementioned theory of outbreeding, the Dodo should have consumed all the ressources on the island and starve. What happened instead was that it thrived.   The problem came, ironically, when humans settled the island and brought with them predators like cats that ultimately lead the the Dodo's extinction.   Now fair, the reason was that the Dodo lost the ability to protect itself aganst predators because it lived without them for so long. Bun the main thing is that **the Dodo slowed its reproduction rate** because there was not a need to fear predators.   So could this happen to other prey species in absence of predators ? This can also be seen in humans: We breed less the more developed we become.",doğasever,1cs0vzq
"Has anyone else noticed that conventional ""humanity-vs-nature"" ethics get weird in the context of Africa, since humans are from there? So, this community is very aware that many ""human problems"" are actually just problems with nature in general, like violence, competition, etc... Self-hating anthropocentrism is still anthropocentrism and suffers from similar logical flaws is the basic idea. So, it's a lot more complicated than a black and white ""humanity versus nature"" dichotomy, since humans are entirely the product of nature and evolution and so on -- and it all took place in the rugged, high-evolutionary-pressure continent of Africa, which explains some aspects of humanity.  Perhaps the most unsatisfyingly incomplete idea you see get tossed around is that we are an invasive species. The one oversight in that idea is Africa... It's a funnily overlooked issue. Are we allowed to do whatever we want to nature in the Horn of Africa, just because we're from there as a species? Obviously not. It just goes to show how important it is to see the big picture here. I've even heard someone say that humanity is an invasive species in the context of Africa before once... There are way less arbitrary ways to argue for conservation, honestly.",doğasever,1chdylw

"Help me understand this standpoint please A coworker linked me to this sub via [a post]( about wolves and predation.  a particular comment has me baffled as to why someone could feel this way, and why people support it.  the comment, or part of it in question is   ""How are we gonna convince those type of people that nature is cruel and we should help end wild animal suffering even if it means interference?""  How can we challenge the idea that nature is good, when the concept/idea of what good is is man made?  If i tried to imagine myself as any other organic living entity on this planet, in any scenario i can't see an outcome of wow, nature is bad.   I would like to think that nature is not good nor bad, that it just exists. And that events we are able to see/are aware of are only good or bad based on our opinions, and the opinions of others that we base ours on in most cases, as a lot of us don't live or experience said scenarios anymore.  As cruel as nature seems at times, nature is just as loving and kind 10 times over i feel. I also feel you really cannot control nature.   Quoting the above quote ""we should help end wild animal suffering"" If i am understanding this stance correctly, you want to kill predators humanely so they don't kill pray inhumanely, if only so nature isn't so cruel in the predator/prey dynamic. But, if a predator has the means to kill humanely, they are allowed to exist? If this is the case, how is this humane for the predators who have no choice but to survive by killing inhumanely?  Or, assuming that all predators kill inhumanely, be it a tiger who goes for the throat and kills quickly, vs a Komodo dragon who, let me tell you, is not an easy site to watch them eat, especially larger prey. How is that fair or humane to the Tiger?   The concept of helping end wild animal suffering by going out and killing the wild animals we deem as killing inhumanely in a humane way, seems inhumane to me?   Am i misunderstanding this concept?  At the end of the day, nature is natural, and it happened before us, and will continue after us. And that us getting involved to that level doesn't help nature, it only helps us with our feelings on how nature handles itself.     My personal stance is that nature is neither good nor bad, right or wrong. It just is, and we are apart of it. Because we are so far advanced in ages, that i think we have lost sight of how we came to be. Like, say, 10,000 years ago, when our early ancestors where hunting mammoths. I don't think there were any easy or clean ways to kill them. I can imagine is was brutal and terrifying and frightening for both the human and the mammoth.   Do our ancestors deserve to be euthanized humanely because they lacked the tools for a humane kill? Or is it now that we have advanced, and that the idea of being able control nature is real to some, that nature has evolved from bad but necessary to unnecessarily bad? Even than, as just another resident of nature, what gives us the right to try and control it?",doğasever,1cxjw5s

"We as a species are the product of a meat grinder that values nothing else than meaningless survival. And it clearly shows. We just like to turn our blind eye to it. A lot of people here keep talking about how more they study human and animal behavior, more they realize our species evolved to be evil and delusional. They´re right.  Humans, in essence, are deeply traumatized apes who suffer a kind of naturaly induced psychosis (optimism bias, wishful thinking, etc.) that most other species don´t. We like to spread bullshit fairy tales and happy ending stories and tell them to children so they have the same kind of mindset implanted and spread it to **their** children. This kind of en-masse worldwide brainwashing has been going on for, let´s say, since the dawn of our species. Take the Lion King for example: [  So endearing, right? Well, I´m gonna link some NSFL videos for you to watch and compare to the movie, feel free to not watch them if you don´t want to.  [Baboon eating gazelle like a piece of fruit]( note: this is one of our closest ancestors, next to chimpanzees. Our ancestry to them really shows if you have ever read a history book...  [Lion cub is murdered by capricious and domineering animalistic behavior]( Seems like the Lion King didn´t really taught you how this world works...  [Young elephant eaten alive by predators]( Could you imagine elephants praising the continuation of a Lion monarchy like in the movie? Not now...  Now imagine if an inquisitive alien species were looking down at this video, with multiple screens. On one large screen, they have the Lion King opening, on a great number of smaller ones, they have satellite footage of all the bloodbath occuring on Earth among animals, both past and present, comparing the cartoon zebras cheering the lion monarchy with the real life zebras being brutally devoured alive. Now, imagine if you were one of them.  What would you feel?  &#x200B;  Here´s another scenario for you to understand better: Imagine if another alien species, this time a truly sadistic and barbaric species that made even the worst humans look like Buddhists who practice the concept of loving-kindness, have been murdering and torturing humanity en masse for thousands of years. Imagine if these very aliens produced a film showing humans cheering these aliens on as some kind of benevolent, noble, admirable species with a message that said ""Behold the wonder and splendor of our cosmos!"" Something like this would be obviously evil and sinister, but yet to be enmeshed in the propaganda machine, one still doesn't get the right emotional response when viewing something as propagandist as The Lion King. It's almost as if our brains have been so deeply conditioned to give what we'd normally find repugnant a pass. Even those of us who know something is wrong... it's just not clicking fully...  Now understand that things like that are being shown to kids in a daily basis. You most likely see the obvious problem with this. Children are constantly being brainwashed by society to fit in the societal norm trought school, entertaiment, their parents and children´s media. The message that all of this is gonna result in some ""happy ending"", that we need to have children, ""work hard"" and then we will all live happily ever after. Why do we make this? Because Nature creates these ""systems"" of belief inside our brain because by its ammoral mindset, we **must** survive, not matter how. We create and spread these ""opmistic"" beliefs to lower suicide rates and make people live another day, so we can drive out species forward in an endless cycle of replication driven by dumb, selfish molecules.  What´s worse is that not even darker, jaded media is free of this memetic propragandist message, check out this article here:  &#x200B;  [grimdarkmagazine.com/the-od..](  From the article:  >Grimdark fiction, on the other hand, tells us that the world can be an awful pile of shit, but *that’s okay*, because people can come through the hard times stronger for it. Grimdark isn’t a celebration of the darkness in life, but of humanity’s ability to endure it.  They just don't see it. The delirious mistake they've made.  &#x200B;  Now to explain why we are evil: our world has largely been a [meat grinder]( for countless hundreds of millions of years. With humans or withour humans. With capitalism or without capitalism. Why? One of the laws of thermodynamics some people don´t know exist but maybe is one (if not **the**) most powerful in our universe is **entropy**. What is it? Well, it basically consists of the fact that it is easier to break something than fix something. It´s easier to create and spread a plague than cure it. It´s easier to write a corrupt law for your own benefits than to create a good one with no loopholes. It´s easier to take a good life than a evil life. You see this in action in our universe constantly because shit breaks contantly, but nothing **ever** miraculously improves. Have you noticed that?  This, collaborating with the existence of natural selection and game theory, has given birth to a psychopathic (evil) and psychotic (delusional, strongly prone to optimism bias, wishful thinking, false beliefs, etc) species. We enslave those weaker than thus, both [animals]( and humans, the majority of which are forced to work shitty labor jobs, with a childhood involving neglect, trauma, ostracism, bullying, and a generally poor quality of life. This is the 'pulse' of our species, we abuse our children, teenagers and the weak and traumatize them to have the same evil, systematic nature we have. Note: this is **not** exclusive to humans; you can see this sort of behavior in lions, tigers, and other great predators that exhibit this kind of evil behavior, even if irrationally. And the worse is that I believe if another animal species raised to sentience and became ""advanced"", they would be the same as us.  &#x200B;  Let us say, just imagine if having actual concern for humanity or life is even possible with the idea of extreme success as a CEO or high-ranking corporate figure. It's just complete fantasy. The degree to which this is a fantasy, is like someone saying ""An antelope could be just as successful being a carnivore as a Lion can."" You simply don't arrive at the positions in those places without being 'carnivorous' towards human beings. Because if you were, you would suffer from the same thing that natural selection punishes a Lion that sucks at killing things would suffer from-- you'd just starve and die, because this is a [**competition**]( A kind, benevolent, caring, concerned, charitable CEO would just get eaten alive. The laws of biology(which, **reminder**: Human beings are subject to) and the laws of physics, **prevent** good people from becoming CEO's or high ranking corporate figures. It's simply the way the universe works.  &#x200B;  Evil **always** works its way to the top in **any** system given enough time-- there's no other way for it not to, in a competition game which says, ""The *sneakiest*, most *dominant*, selfish person climbs, while the most *honest*, most *humble* and *selfless* person gets climbed on.""  Entropy constantly empowers that which is empowered by virtue of being the perfect distillation of evil, like the Lion, like the predator, like the apex psychopath who is, has always, and will always sit on the throne of all sentient systems in this block of spacetime moving towards greater entropy. Evil thrives once it achieves power because the powerless must work against entropy, where evil only plows forward exhibiting its nature effortlessly. Good must go *against* nature to be good. Evil does not need to do anything special to go *with* nature.  I know this is gonna be a long read, but it is needed to explain the hellish conditions we are in this universe. The problem is **not** capitalism, the problem is **not** humanity itself, the problem is nature and the laws of the universe we exist in. It uproots evil and gives it a way to conquer good and use it for its advantage. **This** is the reality that Disney and most media tries to obfuscate to you with systematically spread happy ending stories, even politics and other distractions are there to obfuscate the hellworld that we live in. People have always been trying to find a problem, when the problem is simple: we are in *Hell.*",doğasever,ec2rka

"Being a leftist who doesn't worship nature is alienating Many people perceive nature worship as intrinsically tied to being a leftist. This worship is built on the premise that nature is intrinsically good and, as a result, anything that harms nature is inherently bad. Many people on the right worship nature too, it's just that they are willing to make tradeoffs that benefit them, such as supporting building oil pipelines.   The fundamental problem with nature worship is that it is anthropocentric because it fails to take the perspective of the sentient individuals who make up the majority of beings on this planet, who live short and brutal lives filled with immense suffering:  >The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored.  — Richard Dawkins  When we step outside this anthropocentric perspective of nature, we can see that nature is *not* good and is *not* something that should be worshipped:  >Had Mother Nature been a real parent, she would have been in jail for child abuse and murder.  — Nick Bostrom  I consider myself to be leftist because it most closely aligns with the value I place on reducing suffering. My problem is that I don't feel like I can truly be honest with my views around other leftists and that I have to self-censor the fact that I don't see nature as good, nor environmentalism, conservation or rewilding, which are all based on this same mistaken belief.  Additionally, I find it ironic how leftists uncritically support conservation which is a highly conservative ideology because it pushes the view that sentient individuals who are classified as belonging to ""native"" species are good and ""alien"" or ""invasive"" ones are bad (see [Don’t Demean “Invasives”: Conservation and Wrongful Species Discrimination]( It also holds that abstract entities like ecosystems, populations and species should forever exist in some idealised balanced state when nature is actually in a state of constant flux (see [The ‘balance of nature’ is an enduring concept. But it’s wrong](  I want other leftists to take egalitarianism to its logical conclusion which means rejecting speciesism and giving equal consideration the well-being and interests of *all* sentient beings, regardless of what species they have been classified as belonging to.",doğasever,pkanuj
"Animals don't respect nature A lot of people think that animals respect nature. Humans cause immense amounts of damage to the planet that animals don't. Animals haven't caused any of the problems of civilization, and can't be judged morally by humans. They don't have to work jobs, they don't value money. Therefore, animals seem like ""noble savages"".  But in reality, they don't. Where is the evidence that animals ""respect"" anything else? People talk about how humans view nature as just a resource - well, that's exactly the way animals see it as well. Does a predator killing its prey ""respect"" the value of the prey and make sure to never kill too much or cause too much suffering?  In *The Matrix*, Agent Smith said this:  ""Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.""  This is what every species does. When the wolves disappeared from Yellowstone, the deer multiplied and consumed until the biodiversity lessened because of the lack of vegetation. This didn't stop until the wolves came back to eat the deer. Were the deer concerned about making sure they didn't overgraze? Did they welcome the return of the wolves because they knew they had to be eaten for the good of the environment? Did the wolves eat the deer to help the ecology of Yellowstone? Of course not. All of the species were acting according to their own desires and impulses, without the regards to the feelings of anything else. (Invasive species are another way of recognizing this.)  I think a lot of people see animals as being Stoics: they just see everything ""as is"" and don't make judgments. After all, animals don't have the ability to categorize things or apply labels to them, or understand morality. So obviously, they must be in total harmony with everything, including being eaten alive. Well, no. They're not.  It takes intelligence to value things beyond ourselves. Some animals can show this towards others, sometimes even for different species, but ironically, humans are the only animal capable of seeing value in the ecosystem and caring about it for non-selfish reasons. And we're obviously not doing a good job at that either. Even before industrial civilization was created we were driving species to extinction, a lot of the time even by accident. The ""harmony"" in nature is not caused by cooperation, it is caused by the exact opposite: organisms acting against each others' interests.",doğasever,g7kjfe

"The savagery of predator–prey interactions is unbelievable The videos I’ve seen over the years have scarred me and left me in an almost permanent state of pessimism. It’s not like seeing a violent human interaction, where you think to yourself “that’s horrible but it rarely happens”… no, these scenes of abject suffering are the most mundane and quotidian acts of life on earth; one thing eating another to convert it into energy. Just think how many times this has occurred. And it doesn’t matter how, if it fits, it goes down. Alive, dying or dead, from the head down or the ass up. Elderly, young, sick or healthy; babies just born and some not born yet, cracked from their eggs and cut from their wombs, tiny and pathetic things gasping for air as they’re forced into premature beginnings, expecting a mother’s welcome and receiving only the strange and unfamiliar sensation of pain. Premature beginnings and premature ends. Agony and confusion as their only earthly experiences. And it has been happening for billions of years. Every square inch of this planet is a graveyard. And me and you too, we are products of it. I find it incredibly difficult to wrap my head around.",doğasever,112ky6q

"'I defy anybody to watch that carnage and not intervene': David Attenborough's cameraman tells all BBC wildlife veteran Gavin Thurston has been hunted by lions and survived plane crashes. But watching baby turtles die was the last straw [The article]( is paywalled; here's the text:  >Gavin Thurston has had parasitic worms burrow under his skin while filming in Congo, been slapped by a silverback gorilla and spent the night sleeping next to a deadly puff adder in Sudan. But the most frightening moment, the [Blue Planet]( cameraman tells me over the phone, took place when he was making a programme about rare black rhinos in Namibia, with presenter Saba Douglas-Hamilton.   >   >“I heard this low hoo-hoo sound and I said, knowledgably, to the sound recordist, ‘That’s amazing, there are ground hornbills here!’ You see them normally in pairs of four, they’re a sort of turkey-sized bird. We carried on, got the shot of the rhino… and Saba and the ranger beckoned to us, called us over quite urgently, so we rushed over the camera kit thinking they could maybe still see the rhino.”   >   >“And Saba said to us, ‘There are lions right here. And they’re hunting us now.’ I’m suddenly thinking, s---, how stupid am I? I thought that low sound was ground hornbills – and it wasn’t. It was the contact calls of lions.”   >   >“Sure enough, no sooner had the ranger put bullets in his gun than this lioness came out of nowhere charging straight at us. He fired a shot over her head, she didn’t slow. He fired another shot in front of her, kicked up gravel in her face and she stopped, but her ears were down, she had this most amazing wild, angry look. She was about 15 feet from us, and the ranger said, ‘Right, we’ve got to get back to the car before it gets dark. You look ahead, I’ll keep my eye on this lioness.’   >   >“There were six other lionesses in the group, and I was scanning the trees, the bushes, looking for these other females, wondering where they could be. That buzz of adrenaline it was almost like taking a performance enhancing drug – all your senses come alive. I could see every blade of grass… When we arrived at the car the other six lionesses just stuck their heads up out of the grass. Even with four pairs of eyes, we hadn’t seen them. They’d been tracking us the whole way.”   >   >You may not know Gavin Thurston’s name, but no doubt you’ll have been dazzled by his work, which includes [A Life on Our Planet]( Blue Planet II, Planet Earth II, Frozen Planet, and the cult hit Meerkat Manor (the one with Bill Nighy’s wonderfully droll voiceover). He has won five Emmys and three Baftas for cinematography.    >   >My earliest memory of primary school is sitting open-mouthed with wonder as I watched a video of the “Survival” episode of[ David Attenborough’s ]( series The Private Life of Plants. (Thurston was its Director of Photography.) In his new memoir Journeys in the Wild, Thurston recalls a similar moment from his own schooldays, when he saw Attenborough’s 1979 series Life on Earth: “\[Attenborough\] opened my eyes and mind to a magical world. He brought the natural world into our living rooms.”   >   >They’ve now worked together for more than 30 years. “I remember the first time I met him – God, I was so nervous. I was one of those bumbling idiots who don’t quite know what to say.” But Attenborough was impressed by his work. He’s writes of Thurston in the book's Foreword: “He has endless patience and that invaluable and extraordinary ability to anticipate what an animal is about to do before it does it”. Endless patience is right: he once sat still for 12 hours a day, for 17 straight days, while filming lace monitor lizards.   >   >Working with animals means Thurston is often pondering an ethical dilemma. When filmmakers for Attenborough’s 2018 series Dynasties stepped in to free a group of penguins trapped in a ravine, it prompted weeks of debate in the press. “I would have done exactly the same,” says Thurston. “I find it amazing that some people were angry, saying you shouldn’t interfere… If you think of the damage that man has done to wildlife in general, to help out some dwindling species every now and again? There’s no harm in that at all.”    >   >He sees a clear difference, though, between shuffling snow aside to make a path for some penguins, and actually getting between a predator and its prey. He would always avoid the latter, reminding himself that ‘The predator has to do it – it probably has young it’s got to feed.” But he once made an exception to this rule.   >   >Filming turtles hatching in Australia, day after day Thurston watched as every single hatchling was picked off by gulls before it could make it into the water. After a week of this, he and a colleague finally snapped: “Without saying a word to each other we both got up, gathered as many turtle hatchlings as we could in our T-shirts, and walked down and put them in the sea… I defy anybody else to be in that situation, just to watch that carnage happen time and time again, and not intervene.”   >   >Caging animals is also something he wrestles with. “There is a place for zoos,” he says, but they can’t provide the range of habitats that big, wide-roaming animals like tigers need. “I think we can all relate to this now after this Covid pandemic, what it’s like to be locked up in a flat with restricted movement – well that’s exactly what we’ve inflicted on a lot of these big animals in zoos or in captivity.”   >   >He’s particularly against the idea of keeping orcas in captivity, but he admits he might not have been inspired to take up his career without them: in his memoir, he describes the elation he felt when he borrowed his aunt’s Box Brownie camera at nine years old to take a photo of Cuddles the orca at Dudley Zoo.   >   >Viewers at home, though, sometimes seem more interested in aesthetics than ethics. Recent BBC nature documentaries have come in for criticism over melodramatic music and “fake” sound effects.   >   >“I’m probably one of those people who thinks occasionally the sound is over the top. One thing that maybe we’ve gone overboard in sometimes is the use of foley \[artificial effects\].    >   >“There are some amazing sound recordists out there – there’s a chap I’ve worked with called Chris Watson, who can literally get the sound of ant footprint... It is possible to actually record most things for real and lay them on. I know that is used a lot in natural history filmmaking, but there’s no reason why we can’t have more of that.    >   >“I think also that occasionally the music is overwhelming – it’s gone very cinematic. And yes a series like Planet Earth, having Hans Zimmer doing the music does give it a very, very grand wildlife viewing experience, but maybe that’s just one type of filmmaking. Maybe there is room to have just natural sounds on a natural history programme, for once.”   >   >For Thurston, quieter, understated moments can be more powerful than grand melodramatic clashes. The best scene he never caught on camera, he tells me, was when he saw a western lowland gorilla delicately catch a butterfly out of the air, and examine it, before letting it fly away.   >   >“If that had been a chimpanzee, it would probably have snatched it, probably bitten it, spat it out and carried on… But that gorilla was very much like a sort of Victorian naturalist, it was just inquisitive, it wanted to know what these things were.” It was a reminder of how similar gorillas’ minds can be to ours. It’s a lovely thought: somewhere out there, there’s a gorilla version of Thurston or Attenborough. Perhaps he should have lent it a camera.",doğasever,gs3oeu

"‘Nature worshipers’ sicken me with their response to people and living things suffering in life. ‘Make peace with the natural order of things and just adapt’ Have any of you come across the types of people go like: “It’s the cycle of life, ageing, death and decay. You need a balance of both good and bad.”, “Nature knows best. Especially in natural selection where the unworthy are rooted out, it’s just the order.”?  They try and discourage any systematic change to our existing social order or sometimes certain advances and say “Nature knows best, it is wrong to go against it.”  If anything parallels the ‘evil deity followers’ from fantasy genres it’s these people out of all others. They try and justify the existence of suffering, ‘Darwinian law’, death, ageing and decay or say “It isn’t inherently bad.”  I truely wish there was a way for us to really go against ‘natural law’ or completely eliminate ‘darwinian law’ by either hacking into it somehow or making our own version of ‘nature’ we can go into but that seems really far off into the future.

"This Joseph de Maistre’s quote on nature is tremendous and fits right in here. You’ll probably disagree with some of this French philosopher’s philosophy, especially his politics but his views on nature are spot on:  “In the whole vast domain of living nature there reigns an open violence, a kind of prescriptive fury which arms all the creatures to their common doom. As soon as you leave the inanimate kingdom, you find the decree of violent death inscribed on the very frontiers of life. You feel it already in the vegetable kingdom: from the great catalpa to the humblest herb, how many plants die, and how many are killed. But from the moment you enter the animal kingdom, this law is suddenly in the most dreadful evidence. A power of violence at once hidden and palpable … has in each species appointed a certain number of animals to devour the others. Thus there are insects of prey, reptiles of prey, birds of prey, fishes of prey, quadrupeds of prey. There is no instant of time when one creature is not being devoured by another. Over all these numerous races of animals man is placed, and his destructive hand spares nothing that lives. He kills to obtain food and he kills to clothe himself. He kills to adorn himself, he kills in order to attack, and he kills in order to defend himself. He kills to instruct himself and he kills to amuse himself. He kills to kill. Proud and terrible king, he wants everything and nothing resists him.  From the lamb he tears its guts and makes his harp resound ... from the wolf his most deadly tooth to polish his pretty works of art; from the elephant his tusks to make a toy for his child - his table is covered with corpses ... And who in all of this will exterminate him who exterminates all others? Himself. It is man who is charged with the slaughter of man ... So it is accomplished ... the first law of the violent destruction of living creatures. The whole earth, perpetually steeped in blood, is nothing but a vast altar upon which all that is living must be sacrificed without end, without measure, without pause, until the consummation of things, until evil is extinct, until the death of death.”",doğasever,16p8h8p

"And that is when I first learned about evil. It is built into the very nature of the universe. [    (A reading of this rather evocative quote by Lord Vetinari from the Discworld book series by the late Sir Terry Pratchett)  ""...The Patrician took a sip of his beer. 'I have told this to few people, gentlemen, and I suspect I never will again, but one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs.   A very endearing sight, I’m sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged on to a half-submerged log.   As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy.   One of nature’s wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children.   And that’s when I first learned about evil. It is built into the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior.'  The two wizards exchanged a glance. Vetinari was staring into the depths of his beer mug and they were glad that they did not know what he saw in there...""      \- Lord Vetinari, *Unseen Academicals*, By Terry Pratchett.",doğasever,oeh6qp

"A quote from Joseph de Maistre ""In the whole vast domain of living nature there reigns an open violence, a kind of prescriptive fury which arms all the creatures to their common doom. As soon as you leave the inanimate kingdom, you find the decree of violent death inscribed on the very frontiers of life. You feel it already in the vegetable kingdom: from the great catalpa to the humblest herb, how many plants die, and how many are killed. But from the moment you enter the animal kingdom, this law is suddenly in the most dreadful evidence. A power of violence at once hidden and palpable … has in each species appointed a certain number of animals to devour the others. Thus there are insects of prey, reptiles of prey, birds of prey, fishes of prey, quadrupeds of prey. There is no instant of time when one creature is not being devoured by another. Over all these numerous races of animals man is placed, and his destructive hand spares nothing that lives. He kills to obtain food and he kills to clothe himself. He kills to adorn himself, he kills in order to attack, and he kills in order to defend himself. He kills to instruct himself and he kills to amuse himself. He kills to kill. Proud and terrible king, he wants everything and nothing resists him.  From the lamb he tears its guts and makes his harp resound ... from the wolf his most deadly tooth to polish his pretty works of art; from the elephant his tusks to make a toy for his child - his table is covered with corpses ... And who in all of this will exterminate him who exterminates all others? Himself. It is man who is charged with the slaughter of man ... So it is accomplished ... the first law of the violent destruction of living creatures. The whole earth, perpetually steeped in blood, is nothing but a vast altar upon which all that is living must be sacrificed without end, without measure, without pause, until the consummation of things, until evil is extinct, until the death of death.""  \- Joseph de Maistre",doğasever,r2wezs

"They physical size of humans and the beauty of nature I suspect that one of the reasons that humans value nature aesthetically, is that our physical size protects us from many of its dangers. Having historically made the majority of large and dangerous predators extinct, we only rarely encounter animals that can predate us and even then they are unlikely to attack us; unless they are desperate.  If you were to be shrunk down to an inch tall, then suddenly there would be an incredibly large number of animals that could predate you; the world would be filled with enemies all around, with no escape. Even herbivores would present a considerable threat, as they could accidentally eat or step on you. A parasitoid wasp could sting you and lay its offspring inside your body. A rainstorm could drown or wash you away. A snowstorm could easily bury you alive. Any shelter you can build will be easily destroyed.

"What changed my view on nature - the Mapogo lions This is my first post on this sub, I wanted to share the experience that led me here, and to vent about reactions I've witnessed from others on the subject.  I always enjoyed nature shows growing up.  Whenever I saw instances of brutality that bothered me I would tell myself ""this is just one isolated instance of suffering, most animals live happy lives"".  A couple years ago I was up late one night and watched a documentary on the Mapogo lions. They were a very popular family of male lions, and there are many documentaries and articles about them because of how aggressive they were, even as far as lions go. Even now that they are all deceased, they have a fanbase on facebook that still talks about them and shares pictures of them.   The documentary I watched was obviously very brutal. It goes into detail about how some of the Mapogo lions died in attacks by rival groups, and were ripped apart alive. There's even footage of it happening to one of them. It also describes how they devastated neighboring groups of lions and did the same to them, killing not just the adult males but also their cubs, as many animals do.  The documentary was an eye opener for me, but equally as disturbing to me was the reaction of the Mapogo lions' fanbase to the horror I had just watched. They're enamored with the lions and humanize them in the comment sections of the videos and pictures, but then glorify the horrible deaths that the poor animals suffered, and those they inflicted on other animals. I even saw one article talking about how ""the Mapogo lions are examples of what a lion should be"". Why? Why should they live suffering filled lives that end with even more horrible deaths? So that humans can continue to watch it from afar and glorify it?  For anyone who read this far thank you for listening.

Wolves are a good example of how horrific this process actually is:  >Unlike bears or big cats, wolves do not have an anatomical weapon capable of quickly dispatching such large animals.   >   >They kill by attrition, the entire pack swarming and slashing at the haunches and perineum, ripping away at the legs and the gut, until their victim collapses from exhaustion.   >   >The wolf will approach the prey in the opposite direction of the wind to avoid the animal from detecting the wolf scent and running away. Then they will close in slowly, sometimes in single file.   >   >As soon as their prey is aware it is being pursued and tries to escape, the chase begins. The wolves chase their prey and once caught, bite their animals by attacking the rump or sides.   >   >Large animals with horns are usually attacked this way so the wolves avoid being injured by the horns which are used as weapons against the wolves. Once down, the animal will be weakened and killed with a bite to the throat or snout. Then it is dragged away for all to feed upon or they will begin eating immediately, even though the prey is often still alive for quite some time.

"Society really needs to stop celebrating or looking up to ‘Darwinian Evolution and Selection’, its more likely a time-bomb in reality as seen by the myriad of dead planets surrounding us. Not a ‘force of success’ at all Firstly the devastation of ecosystems comes from people going along the lines of Darwinian evolution in reality, it’s more or so the end stages of when it does produce a ‘dominant species’ on a planet.   Other species subject to Darwinian evolution as some claim have the habit of also devastating others.  People have to do whatever they can to overcome their instincts associated with this and hopefully make a quick push into transhumanism if possible.  It’s a broken mechanic and something to be dreaded, not respected or admired. This is because the end result is a ticking time bomb if we don’t reign in from it and take control of our own future as a species.  It’s just a way of understanding how life evolved, not something to be admired, praised or venerated in any way, shape or form.   Trying to base the way we run our society off of a ‘Divine Natural Order of Darwinian Evolution’ or stopping progress that is seen to ‘go against it’ in the name of venerating it leans towards treating ‘nature’ as some sort of ‘divine force’ that is ‘not to be questioned or opposed’.

"The core anti-vax argument is ""nature is better"" All vaccines have some side effects, and yes, sometimes the cure is worse than the disease itself. But in the case of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccine is a necessary and almost certainly very safe way of ending this humanitarian and economic crisis.  Here in the United States, governmental organizations are [now projecting]( that we are unlikely to achieve herd immunity. Although we have far more vaccine capacity than we need, a group of vaccine hesitant people stand in the way of ending the virus right in its tracks, pointlessly causing numerous more deaths.  Now, to be clear, I understand the desire not to want to inject one's body with a foreign substance that one has had no prior experience with. For most Americans, however, this desire represents a false choice. The choice is not whether to take a foreign substance, but when and which one to take. In other words, you can either take the COVID-19 vaccine, or you can risk getting infected with the virus, as you probably will be, sooner or later. There is little you can do to escape the real choice, besides confining yourself to social isolation forever.  A cursory glance over the comment sections on various social media platforms will reveal the primary anti-vaccine argument, which generally varies little between its speakers. Its main premise is to mistake this false choice for a real choice, and thereby to prefer the natural risk of the virus to the artificial risks from the vaccine. The core of this argument is essentially just [the pro-nature bias]( the scourge of human reasoning from which /r/natureisterrible was formed. And just as usual for the pro-nature bias, it is completely unfounded as an ethical yardstick.  A popular tactic of anti-vaxers is to point out the relatively low rate of death among those who are infected with COVID-19, especially among young and healthy people. Now of course, even taking this argument for granted, being young and healthy doesn't prevent you from infecting other people with the virus. Put another way, this argument, even if it worked, could only justify a selfish course of action. But putting the selfishness objection aside, the argument still fails: the vaccine has a far lower rate of death than COVID-19 natively.  Another common argument fails for the same reason. People say that the vaccine hasn't been tested long-term. You know what also hasn't been tested long-term? The virus.  If we actually evaluated natural and artificial risks the same way, we would often find that we are putting too much faith in nature, and not enough trust in humans. Humanity seems forever plagued to make this same mistake, over and over again. And it is a mistake, because at the end of the day — after all the careful argumentation and statistics — a simple fact remains. Artificial things have a simple reason for being good: someone designed them, and people generally have good intentions. No one designed nature, and thus we can assume that nature is terrible. This is the bias you'd adopt if you really wanted to be safe.",doğasever,nd3lj1

"ChatGPT's response to the question: Why do people idealise nature despite all of the suffering that occurs within it? There are several reasons why people may idealize nature despite the suffering that occurs within it:  1. Romanticization: People may idealize nature because they have a romanticized view of it, viewing it as a place of beauty, peace, and serenity. They may overlook the suffering that occurs within it because they are focused on the positive aspects.  2. Ignorance: Some people may be unaware of the suffering that occurs within nature because they do not have a deep understanding of it. They may be more focused on the beauty of nature and may not fully comprehend the complex interactions and struggles that occur within it.  3. Psychological benefits: People may idealize nature because it brings them a sense of peace, calm, and connection to something larger than themselves. This may help them to cope with stress, anxiety, or other negative emotions.  4. Desire for simplicity: People may idealize nature as a way to escape the complexity and stress of modern life. They may view nature as a simpler, more harmonious place, and may idealize it as a way to find solace and clarity.  5. Personal values: Some people may idealize nature because they have strong personal values that align with environmentalism and the protection of nature. They may view nature as a source of inspiration and may idealize it as a way to promote their values.",doğasever,zt9npr

"Imagine having or retaining child-like cognition/development/language abilities while at the same time watching your body slowly decay and your loved ones slowly passing away There are people literally like this. I just saw a subreddit mentioned for people in that situation and the experiences of those there involving watching themselves slowly decay.  Growing old slowly in your appearance and bodily functions slowly, having no more support networks anymore while still being the same as you were in what you would have seen as the ‘golden days’. Being abandoned and all developmental issues or unfinished business you might have that were unresolved before ‘adult age’ all completely ignored the moment you reach it.  Being treated accordingly with expectations pushed on you that are not suited to your cognition/developmental/language abilities. Its just so heartbreaking.  A pinned topic mentioned that many people with Aspergers/Autism spectrum are like this and it’s not uncommon for some to remain the same in those abilities, could also be down to trauma or other cases.  Even if ageing still happened but we lived in a slightly more fair universe you would think that everybody gets to choose when they ‘age’ or that at the very least ageing would follow cognitive development in correct synch, but ‘nature’ says ‘no’ to that.

I don't think this on its own would stop me dating someone, but I could see a potential conflict arising between their values in mine if they also identify as a conservationist because conservationists generally value the preservation of nature in its current state, regardless of the horrific amount of suffering experienced by animals in the wild, while I hold the view that we should work to reduce this suffering, even if this goes against preserving or restoring nature to some ""ideal"" state.",doğasever,l820oa

Nature, being inconstant and taking pleasure in creating and making constantly new lives and forms, because she knows that her terrestrial materials become thereby augmented, is more ready and more swift in her creating, than time in his destruction; and so she has ordained that many animals shall be food for others. Nay, this not satisfying her desire, to the same end she frequently sends forth certain poisonous and pestilential vapours upon the vast increase and congregation of animals; and most of all upon men, who increase vastly because other animals do not feed upon them; and, the causes being removed, the effects would not follow. This earth therefore seeks to lose its life, desiring only continual reproduction; and as, by the argument you bring forward and demonstrate, like effects always follow like causes, animals are the image of the world.  — Leonardo da Vinci, [*The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci*]( (1888), fol. 1219",doğasever,d7rkrh

"Amy Tuteur on ""natural"" health and birth >“The term ‘nature’ is a cultural construct,” she said. “When people talk about natural health, they’re talking about a nature that existed only in their minds, one that reflects a wealthy culture unaware of its privilege.”   >   >In conversation and her writing, Tuteur reels off grim statistics of sky-high mortality in developing nations, where births are natural by necessity, not choice. She quotes Euripides’s Medea: “I would rather stand three times with a shield in battle than give birth once.” To feminist critiques of paternalist medicine that forces drugs on women, Tuteur responds by pointing out it was women along with men who championed anesthesia for childbirth in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. For her, the real sources of female empowerment with regard to birth are access to contraception, pain relief, and modern obstetrics, unnatural though they may be. Demonizing them causes needless suffering and guilt, pulling women back toward an era when they were meant to suffer silently and gladly for the sake of their children. “I liken this desire for ‘natural’ to religious fundamentalism,” she said. “Midwives and natural births were around for a long time, and maternal and neonatal mortality were horrendous.

"On Hard Work A few years ago, I tried to work out in the gym. I set a goal that within a year, I would grow muscles. It lasted only two months and then I quit. Since then, I gained lots of weight and I still struggle with the idea of getting back in shape, but I realized something. If I go back to the gym, I couldn't work out hard enough to get the reward I wanted, so this dream is kinda dead to me, but I still envy muscular men.  Until very recently, I thought I could do whatever I wanted without putting myself through distress and still get rewarded. I thought I could squeeze as much as I'd like, and get the juice I need.   Turns out the world doesn't go this way. To get ""rewarded"" or compensated, you have to put yourself through distress and trauma, there's no escape from that. But here's the kicker, what if nothing is worth getting yourself in such distress to begin with? What no amount nor quality of juice justifies squeezing so hard?  This puts me in a very hard position. I'm not given the choice to play easy and get an easy reward, but there's a minimum standard that I have to do, and if I don't do it, I'm screwed.

Today while walking I heard a squawk from under my feet, upon looking down I realized there was a bird that looked injured. I grabbed a shirt to pick it up with, when i got it up I realized that its leg was badly injured. a few times it flew out of my hand, but it was unable to fly for distances of further than 30 yards. I put into a box for a while in order to try to keep it safe. While keeping it in the box my dad's dog came and noticed it in their and charged toward with full primal intent, I wrestled him with all my strength to protect that bird. He growled and snarled at me in ways he never has before, his teeth reached out at me as though he wanted to bite, but my legs wrapped around his torso prevented him from doing so. I finally gripped him and tossed him up onto my shoulders to carry him back towards the house as he growled and barked loud for everyone to hear. I later switched the box for one that could be closed easier so that the bird couldn't get out and nothing could get in, but it wasn't air locked. In the end the bird did manage to get out and crawled into a space where it was hidden away from everything, I realized that all I was doing was prolonging the inevitable death and that I should not do so in a manner outside of its own control for one's death this should not be ended or prolonged without their own consent.

Is that when it was Eden?   >   >...   >   >In short, the romantic view of the natural world as a blissful Eden is only held by people who have no actual experience of nature. People who live in nature are not romantic about it at all. They may hold spiritual beliefs about the world around them, they may have a sense of the unity of nature or the aliveness of all things, but they still kill the animals and uproot the plants in order to eat, to live. If they don't, they will die.   >   >And if you, even now, put yourself in nature even for a matter of days, you will quickly be disabused of all your romantic fantasies. Take a trek through the jungles of Borneo, and in short order you will have festering sores on your skin, you'll have bugs all over your body, biting in your hair, crawling up your nose and into your ears, you'll have infections and sickness and if you're not with somebody who knows what they're doing, you'll quickly starve to death. But chances are that even in the jungles of Borneo you won't experience nature so directly, because you will have covered your entire body with DEET and you will be doing everything you can to keep those bugs off you.   >   >The truth is, almost nobody wants to experience real nature. What people want is to spend a week or two in a cabin in the woods, with screens on the windows. They want a simplified life for a while, without all their stuff. Or a nice river rafting trip for a few days, with somebody else doing the cooking. Nobody wants to go back to nature in any real way, and nobody does. It's all talk-and as the years go on, and the world population grows increasingly urban, it's uninformed talk. Farmers know what they're talking about. City people don't. It's all fantasy.   >   >One way to measure the prevalence of fantasy is to note the number of people who die because they haven't the least knowledge of how nature really is. They stand beside wild animals, like buffalo, for a picture and get trampled to death; they climb a mountain in dicey weather without proper gear, and freeze to death. They drown in the surf on holiday because they can't conceive the real power of what we blithely call ""the force of nature."" They have seen the ocean. But they haven't been in it.   >   >But the natural world is not so malleable. On the contrary, it will demand that you adapt to it-and if you don't, you die.

My guide set out ropes for people to hold as they crossed the river, and everybody proceeded, one at a time, with extreme care. I asked the guide what was the big deal about crossing a three-foot river. He said, well, supposing you fell and suffered a compound fracture. We were now four days trek from the last big town, where there was a radio. Even if the guide went back double time to get help, it'd still be at least three days before he could return with a helicopter. If a helicopter were available at all.

"Some thoughts on wildlife documentaries I recently watched part of the new series *Our Planet* and I thought I'd share some thoughts on wildlife documentaries in general from a critical perspective:  * This style of wildlife documentary is made with a clear message: nature exists in a ""perfectly balanced state"" — a view which is widely discredited by academic ecologists who prefer instead the metaphor of “the flux of nature” (see [On “the balance of nature” myth]( — which is under threat and that we must work tirelessly to preserve it i.e. conservationism. * As a visual medium, there is a strong emphasis on the aesthetic value of nature, with lovingly-constructed cinematography which features numerous slow-motion and other incredibly well-constructed shots. * Existing within these balanced ecosystems, nonhuman animals have specific purposes i.e. predators and prey; this is the way things are and should be e.g. this type of nonhuman animal is ""food"" for another. * Narratives are constructed throughout, using editing, emotive music and sound effects. This is often based on artifice:  >the shots of the octopus on land evoke alien invasion movies. At one point, the octopus is shown in shadow, as aliens are before the big reveal. In the context of *Abdopus aculeatus*, these choices feel like a joke, a way of acknowledging that a sea creature is ""invading"" land. I laughed my way through the segment. After I’d finished watching the episode, I rewound the to the octopus footage and watched it again. It was a combination of so many things we think of as artifice — music, clever editing, deliberate narrativizing.  —   Elizabeth Lopatto, “[How natural are nature documentaries?](  * These narratives are snapshots, we don't see what happens to the nonhuman animals after the cameras stop rolling:  >Predation is accepted by human culture to be just part of the circle of life, but what if the prey animal survives the attack? Oftentimes, the documentary will leave the viewer with the impression that the animal survived *and* thrived after the hunt, but injuries sustained can be just as deadly, if not only inducing prolonged suffering. An animal, such as a gazelle, with an infected injury may die from the infection or exposure to disease in combination with a weakened immune system. If the injury does not kill them, in most cases, their life span is drastically shortened.  — Desli Norcross, “[Wildlife Documentaries: What Happens to the Limping Gazelle?](  * The camera operator is meant to be invisible, an impassive observer. They, like the audience should not interfere with this natural world, even to help other sentient individuals who are clearly suffering. This lens is a speciesist one, we would not think twice about helping humans suffering in similar situations, yet we are happy to do so and even encourage leaving nonhuman animals of other species unaided. * For the average person, this is pretty much the only time that they will ever interact with the nonhuman animals displayed on the screen, so this may distort thinking on the lives of these sentient individuals. * The nonhuman animals are understood holistically part of the wider concept of nature, not as individuals with intrinsic value in of themselves. * These documentaries are made with the intention of getting as large an audience as is possible, meaning that there is benefit in sacrificing ethics. * The most disturbing parts are often deliberately left out:  >People who accuse us of putting in too much violence, \[should see\] what we leave on the cutting-room floor. My conscience troubles me more about reducing the pain and savagery that there is in the natural world than the reverse.  — David Attenborough, “[David Attenborough: I'm an essential evil](

"“Nature is no sentimentalist,—does not cosset or pamper us. We must see that the world is rough and surly, and will not mind drowning a man or a woman; but swallows your ship like a grain of dust...” — Ralph Waldo Emerson >Nature is no sentimentalist,—does not cosset or pamper us. We must see that the world is rough and surly, and will not mind drowning a man or a woman; but swallows your ship like a grain of dust. The cold, inconsiderate of persons, tingles your blood, benumbs your feet, freezes a man like an apple. The diseases, the elements, fortune, gravity, lightning, respect no persons. The way of Providence is a little rude. The habit of snake and spider, the snap of the tiger and other leapers and bloody jumpers, the crackle of the bones of his prey in the coil of the anaconda,—these are in the system, and our habits are like theirs. You have just dined, and, however scrupulously the slaughter-house is concealed in the graceful distance of miles, there is complicity,—expensive races,—race living at the expense of race. The planet is liable to shocks from comets, perturbations from planets, rendings from earthquake and volcano, alterations of climate, precessions of equinoxes. Rivers dry up by opening of the forest. The sea changes its bed. Towns and counties fall into it. At Lisbon, an earthquake killed men like flies. At Naples, three years ago, ten thousand persons were crushed in a few minutes. The scurvy at sea; the sword of the climate in the west of Africa, at Cayenne, at Panama, at New Orleans, cut off men like a massacre. Our western prairie shakes with fever and ague. The cholera, the small-pox, have proved as mortal to some tribes, as a frost to the crickets, which, having filled the summer with noise, are silenced by a fall of the temperature of one night. Without uncovering what does not concern us, or counting how many species of parasites hang on a bombyx; or groping after intestinal parasites, or infusory biters, or the obscurities of alternate generation;—the forms of the shark, the *labrus*, the jaw of the sea-wolf paved with crushing teeth, the weapons of the grampus, and other warriors hidden in the sea,—are hints of ferocity in the interiors of nature. Let us not deny it up and down. Providence has a wild, rough, incalculable road to its end, and it is of no use to try to whitewash its huge, mixed instrumentalities, or to dress up that terrific benefactor in a clean shirt and white neckcloth of a student in divinity.   >   >Will you say, the disasters which threaten mankind are exceptional, and one need not lay his account for cataclysms every day? Aye, but what happens once, may happen again, and so long as these strokes are not to be parried by us, they must be feared.  — Ralph Waldo Emerson, [*The Conduct of Life*]( (1860)",doğasever,hpr8zv

Without a functioning ecosystem, human civilization itself could not function. Also, a mass extinction event will cause a lot of suffering in and of itself. So it's a bit conflicting.

"Exploding toads > According to worldwide media reports in April 2005, toads in the Altona district of Hamburg were observed by nature protection officials to swell up with gases and explode, propelling their innards for distances of up to one meter. These incidents prompted local residents to refer to the area's lake—home to the toads—as: Tümpel des Todes, lit. 'Pool of Death'. The incidents were reported as occurring with greatest frequency between 2 and 3 a.m. Werner Smolnik, environmental movement worker, stated on April 26, 2005, at least 1,000 toads had died in this manner over a series of a few days.[17] According to German conservationist Werner Smolnik, the toads expanded to three and a half times their normal size before blowing up, and were noted to live a short time after exploding.[18]  > Berlin veterinarian Franz Mutschmann collected toad corpses and performed necropsies. He theorized that the phenomenon was linked to a recent influx of predatory crows to the area. He stated that the cause was a mixture of crow attacks and the natural puff up defense of the toads. Crows attacked the toads in order to pick through the skin between the amphibians' chests and abdominal cavities, picking out the toads' livers, which appear to be a delicacy for crows in the area. In a defensive move, the toads begin to blow themselves up, which in turn, due to the hole in the toad's body and the missing liver, led to a rupture of blood vessels and lungs, and to the spreading of intestines. The apparent epidemic nature of the phenomenon was also explained by Mutschmann: ""Crows are intelligent animals. They learn very quickly how to eat the toads' livers.""[17]",doğasever,qduquv

"An analysis of Val Plumwood's essay “Being Prey” In [this essay]( environmental philosopher and ecofeminist, Val Plumwood tells the story of how she survived a crocodile attack when canoeing in Kakadu National Park, Australia. Ironically, her actions as a conservationist contributed to the large numbers of crocodiles in the park and an unconsidered increased risk of human attacks:  >Not long ago, saltwater crocodiles were considered endangered, as virtually all mature animals in Australia's north were shot by commercial hunters. But after a decade and more of protection, they are now the most plentiful of the large animals of Kakadu National Park. I was actively involved in preserving such places, and for me, the crocodile was a symbol of the power and integrity of this place and the incredible richness of its aquatic habitats.  This anthropocentric symobilic valuing of the crocodiles fails to acknowledge the immense suffering that they inflict on the sentient beings that they predate and the fact that more crocodiles would lead to an increase in incidences of predation.  Plumwood's description of the attack is a horrifying insight into what the victims of crocodile attacks (human and nonhuman alike) experience:  >Few of those who have experienced the crocodile's death roll have lived to describe it. It is, essentially, an experience beyond words of total terror. The crocodile's breathing and heart metabolism are not suited to prolonged struggle, so the roll is an intense burst of power designed to overcome the victim's resistance quickly. The crocodile then holds the feebly struggling prey underwater until it drowns. The roll was a centrifuge of boiling blackness that lasted for an eternity, beyond endurance, but when I seemed all but finished, the rolling suddenly stopped. My feet touched bottom, my head broke the surface, and, coughing, I sucked at air, amazed to be alive. The crocodile still had me in its pincer grip between the legs. I had just begun to weep for the prospects of my mangled body when the crocodile pitched me suddenly into a second death roll.   >   >When the whirling terror stopped again I surfaced again, still in the crocodile's grip next to a stout branch of a large sandpaper fig growing in the water. I grabbed the branch, vowing to let the crocodile tear me apart rather than throw me again into that spinning, suffocating hell. For the first time I realized that the crocodile was growling, as if angry. I braced myself for another roll, but then its jaws simply relaxed; I was free. I gripped the branch and pulled away, dodging around the back of the fig tree to avoid the forbidding mud bank, and tried once more to climb into the paperbark tree.   >   >As in the repetition of a nightmare, the horror of my first escape attempt was repeated. As I leapt into the same branch, the crocodile seized me again, this time around the upper left thigh, and pulled me under. Like the others, the third death roll stopped, and we came up next to the sandpaper fig branch again. I was growing weaker, but I could see the crocodile taking a long time to kill me this way. I prayed for a quick finish and decided to provoke it by attacking it with my hands. Feeling back behind me along the head, I encountered two lumps. Thinking I had the eye sockets, I jabbed my thumbs into them with all my might. They slid into warm, unresisting holes (which may have been the ears, or perhaps the nostrils), and the crocodile did not so much as flinch. In despair, I grabbed the branch again. And once again, after a time, I felt the crocodile jaws relax, and I pulled free.   >   >I knew I had to break the pattern; up the slippery mud bank was the only way. I scrabbled for a grip, then slid back to-ward the waiting jaws. The second time I almost made it before again sliding back, braking my slide by grabbing a tuft of grass. I hung there, exhausted\*. I can't make it, I thought. It'll just have to come and get me.\* The grass tuft began to give way. Flailing to keep from sliding farther, I jammed my fingers into the mud. This was the clue I needed to survive. I used this method and the last of my strength to climb up the bank and reach the top. I was alive!  Following the attack, Plumwood describes how she didn't want to publicise the encounter, as it would propagate the ""masculinist monster myth: the master narrative"" sensationalised by the media, which could potentially lead to the mass slaughter of crocodiles.  Later, she argues that there is a strong denial of the idea that humans can be food for other animals, but not the reverse:  >It seems to me that in the human supremacist culture of the West there is a strong effort to deny that we humans are also animals positioned in the food chain. This denial that we ourselves are food for others is reflected in many aspects of our death and burial practices—the strong coffin, conventionally buried well below the level of soil fauna activity, and the slab over the grave to prevent any other thing from digging us up, keeps the Western human body from becoming food for other species. Horror movies and stories also reflect this deep-seated dread of becoming food for other forms of life: Horror is the wormy corpse, vampires sucking blood, and alien monsters eating humans. Horror and outrage usually greet stories of other species eating humans. Even being nibbled by leeches, sand flies, and mosquitoes can stir various levels of hysteria.   >   >This concept of human identity positions humans outside and above the food chain, not as part of the feast in a chain of reciprocity but as external manipulators and masters of it: Animals can be our food, but we can never be their food. The outrage we experience at the idea of a human being eaten is certainly not what we experience at the idea of animals as food. The idea of human prey threatens the dualistic vision of human mastery in which we humans manipulate nature from outside, as predators but never prey. We may daily consume other animals by the billions, but we ourselves cannot be food for worms and certainly not meat for crocodiles. This is one reason why we now treat so inhumanely the animals we make our food, for we cannot imagine ourselves similarly positioned as food. We act as if we live in a separate realm of culture in which we are never food, while other animals inhabit a different world of nature in which they are no more than food, and their lives can be utterly distorted in the service of this end.  Plumwood uses this assertion to justify her vegetarianism but not to oppose predation in general:  >Reflection has persuaded me that not just humans but any creature can make the same claim to be more than just food. We are edible, but we are also much more than edible. Respectful, ecological eating must recognize both of these things. I was a vegetarian at the time of my encounter with the crocodile, and remain one today. This is not because I think predation itself is demonic and impure, but because I object to the reduction of animal lives in factory farming systems that treat them as living meat.  It is clear that Plumwood's encounter with the crocodile did not shake her faith in ecological integrity; it may have actually strengthened it:  >Large predators like lions and crocodiles present an important test for us. An ecosystem's ability to support large predators is a mark of its ecological integrity. Crocodiles and other creatures that can take human life also present a test of our acceptance of our ecological identity. When they're allowed to live freely, these creatures indicate our preparedness to coexist with the otherness of the earth, and to recognize ourselves in mutual, ecological terms, as part of the food chain, eaten as well as eater.  Overall, it seems that Plumwood is critical of human predation of factory-farmed animals from an ecological perspective, but not against predation by other animals because of their ""valuable"" contributions to ecological integrity. Ultimately her position is anthropocentric, as she fails to consider the experiences and painful deaths of the nonhuman animals that animals crocodiles predate as negative or something that should be prevented, despite undergoing the visceral experience of ""being prey"" herself.",doğasever,gf65y1

"Herman Melville on the “universal cannibalism of the sea” (from Moby Dick) >But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the globe.   >   >Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.  [Source](

"Nature is Terrible Book Club This is the most interesting and surprising community I’ve encountered so far. In a lot of ways I already subscribe to this ideology, and in a lot of ways I do not. I read Annie Dillard’s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek and it changed my worldview radically (and her For the Time Being is even more relevant to the topics here). Ever since, I have been thinking about the horror of nature.  I’d like to find more books or articles on the subject but am having trouble knowing where/how to look. I’d love to hear your recommendations, either the reading that changed your worldview or ones that you find most important.  **I will include your recommendations here in the post, so that you can easily find them too without having to navigate through the whole discussion:**  Books:   * The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins  * The Balance of Nature: Ecology's Enduring Myth by John Kricher  * The Hedonistic Imperative by David Pearce  * The Speciesism of Leaving Nature Alone, and the Theoretical Case for ""Wildlife Anti-Natalism"" by Magnus Vinding  * New and Selected Poems, Vol. 1, by Mary Oliver * The Lucifer Principle by Howard Bloom  * The Road by Cormack McCarthy  Articles/Essays:   * ""On Nature"" by John Stuart Mill  * ""Beauty-Driven Morality"" by Brian Tomasik  * ""An Alien God"" by Eliezer Yudkowsky  \*\*\*  **Discussion**: When I say I’m not fully part of this ideology, what I mean is this. When I immerse myself in the real moral “horror” of nature, I always ask myself, WHY do I feel horrified? Many of us are afraid of spiders, and many more of us have taken conscious steps to stop being horrified and instead see beauty. We cannot or should not project our moral sense of right and wrong onto the amoral. So, like learning to love the spider for what it is, why not stare straight at the horror and love it for what it is too? After all, many of our examples (parasites killing a caterpillar, for example) arbitrarily take sides. Instead of celebrating the success of the parasite, we feel horror at the death of the caterpillar. But why not feel both wonder and horror, and note that this is the way of nature? Moral horror when it comes to moral agents must be somehow categorically different, no? Loving horror in nature is not to condone horrible acts committed by humans. It is instead to acknowledge that what may be seen by humans as horrible in the natural world can be a side effect of the admittedly good moral worldview we adopt in order to live in harmony with each other.  I vacillate between the views stated above and a desire to be so radically “good” that I ache at the thoughts of the germs I am killing when I wash my hands or brush my teeth. This is life too, isn’t it? If I value “life” over particular forms of life I run into problems all over the place, for I also am trying to survive and thrive on this planet. How do we avoid this problem? My sense of goodness can theoretically just lead me to a desire for nonexistence. Instead, I can continue to think of living in nature as a struggle to survive, without seeing everything competing against me as “morally bad or evil.”  Still, I return time and again to the horror of nature, and appreciate the posts here, because we DO too often think of nature as benign toward us, and horror, oddly enough, wakes people up to beauty. I don’t want to rid myself of the sense of moral horror at some things in nature, but I then want to set that horror aside and come to see beauty in it.  Thoughts? Please be respectful in explaining your views and I will do the same!",doğasever,erxti5

"Clarence Darrow Nature knows nothing about right and wrong, good and evil, pleasure and  pain; she simply acts. She creates a beautiful woman, and places a  cancer on her cheek. She may create an idealist, and kill him with a  germ. She creates a fine mind, and then burdens it with a deformed body.  And she will create a fine body, apparently for no use whatever. She  may destroy the most wonderful life when its work has just commenced.  She may scatter tubercular germs broadcast throughout the world. She  seemingly works with no method, plan or purpose. She knows no mercy nor  goodness. Nothing is so cruel and abandoned as Nature. To call her  tender or charitable is a travesty upon words and a stultification of  intellect. No one can suggest these obvious facts without being told  that he is not competent to judge Nature and the God behind Nature. If  we must not judge God as evil, then we cannot judge God as good. In all  the other affairs of life, man never hesitates to classify and judge,  but when it comes to passing on life, and the responsibility of life, he  is told that it must be good, although the opinion beggars reason and  intelligence and is a denial of both. Emotionally, I shall no doubt act  as others do to the last moment of my existence. With my last breath I  shall probably try to draw another, but, intellectually, I am satisfied  that life is a serious burden, which no thinking, humane person would  wantonly inflict on some one else.   * [Clarence Darrow]( [*The Story of My Life*]( 1932",doğasever,f275gm

Thousands of animals and plants must daily perish in every part of the earth, in order that a few chosen individuals may continue to subsist and to enjoy life. But even the existence of these favoured few is a continual conflict with threatening dangers of every kind. Thousands of hopeful germs perish uselessly every minute. The raging war of interests in human society is only a feeble picture of the unceasing and terrible war of existence which reigns throughout the whole of the living world.

But wait, you say, there is no right and wrong in nature; right and wrong is a human concept. Precisely: we are moral creatures, then, in an amoral world. The universe that suckled us is a monster that does not care if we live or die—does not care if it itself grinds to a halt. It is fixed and blind, a robot programmed to kill. We are free and seeing; we can only try to outwit it at every turn to save our skins.   >   >This view requires that a monstrous world running on chance and death, careening blindly from nowhere to nowhere, somehow produced wonderful us.

And just as he talked that way, in the woods – something had got into its nest. Nature was being cruel. The woods are killing each other anyway.

However, this assumption is wrong...” — Oscar Horta > It is commonly believed that animal ethics entails respect for natural processes, because nonhuman animals are able to live relatively easy and happy lives in the wild. However, this assumption is wrong. Due to the most widespread reproductive strategy in nature, r-selection, the overwhelming majority of nonhuman animals die shortly after they come into existence. They starve or are eaten alive, which means their suffering vastly outweighs their happiness. Hence, concern for nonhuman animals entails that we should try to intervene in nature to reduce the enormous amount of harm they suffer.

The phrase itself implies that the planet is a moral patient which we have duties towards. Of course the planet itself will be fine whatever humans do to it. Its capacity to sustain to life may be diminished in certain instances, but life is extremely resilient and has survived far worse than us (see [extremophiles]( and [extinction events]( This Michael Crichton quote illustrates this point well:  >You think man can destroy the planet? What intoxicating vanity. Let me tell you about our planet. Earth is four-and-a-half-billion-years-old. There’s been life on it for nearly that long, 3.8 billion years. Bacteria first; later the first multicellular life, then the first complex creatures in the sea, on the land. Then finally the great sweeping ages of animals, the amphibians, the dinosaurs, at last the mammals, each one enduring millions on millions of years, great dynasties of creatures rising, flourishing, dying away — all this against a background of continuous and violent upheaval. Mountain ranges thrust up, eroded away, cometary impacts, volcano eruptions, oceans rising and falling, whole continents moving, an endless, constant, violent change, colliding, buckling to make mountains over millions of years. Earth has survived everything in its time.   >   >It will certainly survive us. If all the nuclear weapons in the world went off at once and all the plants, all the animals died and the earth was sizzling hot for a hundred thousand years, life would survive, somewhere: under the soil, frozen in arctic ice. Sooner or later, when the planet was no longer inhospitable, life would spread again. The evolutionary process would begin again. Might take a few billion years for life to regain its present variety. Of course, it would be very different from what it is now, but the earth would survive our folly, only we would not. If the ozone layer gets thinner, ultraviolet radiation sears earth, so what? Ultraviolet radiation is good for life. It’s powerful energy. It promotes mutation, change. Many forms of life will thrive with more UV radiation. Many others will die out. You think this is the first time that’s happened? Think about oxygen. Necessary for life now, but oxygen is actually a metabolic poison, a corrosive gas, like fluorine.   >   >When oxygen was first produced as a waste product by certain plant cells some three billion years ago, it created a crisis for all other life on earth. Those plants were polluting the environment, exhaling a lethal gas. Earth eventually had an atmosphere incompatible with life. Nevertheless, life on earth took care of itself. In the thinking of the human being a hundred years is a long time. Hundred years ago we didn’t have cars, airplanes, computers or vaccines. It was a whole different world, but to the earth, a hundred years is nothing. A million years is nothing. This planet lives and breathes on a much vaster scale. We can’t imagine its slow and powerful rhythms, and we haven’t got the humility to try. We’ve been residents here for the blink of an eye. If we’re gone tomorrow, the earth will not miss us.  What is actually meant is protecting/preserving the earth's capacity to sustain human life, nonhuman animals who belong to certain “charismatic” species e.g. lions, giraffes and things like biodiversity and ecosystems, which have instrumental value to humans. The state the planet is in now, is seen as the desired state for how it *should* always be. This is despite the fact that the world is in a constant state of chaotic flux — very far from stable.  One can also infer that it is “saving the planet” from human activity, not natural processes like volcanoes, earthquakes and asteroids which can also have significant effects on living beings. People tend to care more about changing things that humans are seen as being directly responsible for i.e. intentionality. This leads some environmentalists to simply thinking that the planet would be better off without humans, since we are seen as irredeemably causing harm to life. This does not acknowledge the significance of the suffering of nonhuman animals in the wild (due to non-anthropogenic causes), who will suffer unaided for millions of more years.",doğasever,bge496
The Horror of the Slaver Ant ,doğasever,zijyjp
"On tactics for reducing suffering I really believe that the current tactics most people who are concerned with suffering in nature are using to try and alleviate this problem are misguided and not at all the most effective way of going about it. In general, few people are trying to raise awareness of the issue to the general population and are instead focusing on working for obscure nonprofits that aim to research animal suffering. The rationale I usually hear behind it is that the general population is ""not ready"" to confront the issue of animal suffering, due to the average person's repulsed reaction at the idea of intervening in nature. Thus, people argue, it is better to work and research on the sidelines with some elite group of people who ""really understand"" separate from the overall scientific community. I think this is a very flawed strategy for several reasons.  &#x200B;  1. A lot of the people working in these organizations, or people writing articles about the problem of wild animal suffering in general, seem to be woefully uneducated on the topic of ecology. Rather than actual ecologists making their arguments based on a detailed knowledge of how ecosystems work and familiarity with the scholarship, these are people taking an article here and there and jumping to wild conclusions. Besides this meaning the conclusions drawn on what is best to do about animal suffering are meaningless, it leaves us open to our moral views being dismissed along with the policy prescriptions as if they come from creationists or climate change deniers. I've seen the argument that the actual experts all agree that species and ecosystems should be considered morally important rather than individuals and should be preserved, so therefore our view represents a complete denial of science. Of course this is nonsense, they are confusing moral/philosophical end goals which are not determined by scientific knowledge with an understanding of how an ecosystem currently IS and how it works, which absolutely does depend on scientific knowledge. If welfare ecologists were actually knowledgable about ecology and integrated into the scientific community, it would become clearer that the disagreement is moral and not based on a lack of knowledge.  2. Even if people working in wild animal suffering-related organizations were actually as knowledgable in ecology as ecologists with mainstream moral goals, progress is going to be a lot slower in a small fringe community than a larger scientific community consisting of many people. In this day and age, science isn't done by just one person or group of people but by a larger community across many parts of the world sharing ideas. If we are able to make ideas of animals suffering mainstream to the point where the larger scientific community is doing research with the aim of preventing suffering rather than conservation, research would be able to be far faster and more effective. 3. Even if the small, isolated, largely uneducated, community was somehow able to produce good, peer-reviewed research detailing exactly what would be the best utilitarian interventions in ecosystems, what would be the point if 99% of the population has never been exposed to these ideas and thus instinctively thinks intervention is abhorrent, so these perfect strategies will never be adopted in real life? Preventing wild animal suffering would require the cooperation of whole societies, prescriptions are useless if no one is willing to put them in action. 4. The common view that the world is not ready for concern for wild animal suffering prescribes a strategy that has never worked for movements in the past. Do you think the abolition of slavery or LGBTQ+ rights became reality by the small minority who believed in these things keeping their views secret so that most of society had never even encountered the idea, waiting for the ""right time"" to subtly manipulate public opinion towards it that might never come? No, these things happened by people saying their views out loud and exposing the public to the idea, even if most people initially thought it was absurd. It's better for everyone to know about these ideas even if most people disagree with it than for no one to know at all. Certainly when you are making an argument to expose the public to these ideas you should choose your words carefully and look into the objections other people have made to avoid a weak argument that will give people a bad impression, but that's no excuse to just hide away from the world.   So a while back I saw a thread where someone with the username ""takeecologyclasses"" was replying to Tomasik when he visited this subreddit, telling him that this user's ecology professor had strongly criticized Tomasik's writings as getting everything about ecology wrong. And that person is completely right. Take ecology classes, everyone! If you truly recognize the extreme moral importance of wild animal suffering, then spend time to actually know what you are talking about and not having your moral views dismissed because you don't have the knowledge to properly talk about them! From my personal experience, I would also add to take neuroscience classes so you can talk about the sentience and experiences of animals with knowledge of how their brains actually work rather than just mindless speculation. Take classes and expose these views to society and the scientific community to actually make a difference in the world instead of just staying on the fringes of society talking about ideas with like-minded people that 99% of the population have never encountered or considered. Be willing to devote your life to this, because that's what the urgency of the situation deserves, and the only way to actually changing things in the world is confronting it.",doğasever,uxkuv2

"An attempt at challenging this sub's statement Full disclosure here. . . I'm an environmentalist, and have been all of my life. However, I'm also sensible enough to see that there are aspects of nature that are inherently contradictory to our values as a sapient species. I'm not going to deny that, because I'm not one of those idiots who thinks humanity should ""go back to nature"" (whatever *that* means). What I do think is that it's foolish at best, and dangerous at worst, to hold other species to our standards of morality.   As a species, *Homo sapiens* is a relative newcomer. We first showed up in Africa about a million years ago, and since then we've more or less come to dominate the planet. You could say we've done pretty well, for a bunch of hairless apes. But in geological terms, one million years is practically nothing. A million years ago, most of the animals and plants on Earth were the same as the ones around today (except, of course, the ones we've killed off since then).   I bring this up because the *average lifespan* of a mammal species is about 3 million years. Even if we are average, we've barely lasted a third of that time. So now go back three million years, to the late Pliocene. The ancestors of humans, at this point, were barely more than upright apes. The Earth's climate was beginning to cool, and grasslands were expanding as forests shrank. Several animal groups became extinct at the beginning of the Pleistocene, even before humans as we know them evolved-- deinotheres, chalicotheres, and phorusrhacids, to name only three.   Now go back 40 million more years. The hothouse climate that had dominated during the Paleocene and Eocene came to an end, and the lush forests that covered most of the world gave way to grasslands. The result was a mass die-off of forest-adapted animals, and their subsequent replacement by grassland-dwellers.   25 million years before that, Earth bore witness to a cataclysm of unimaginable scope. An asteroid six miles across struck what is now the Gulf of Mexico, ultimately killing off the dinosaurs and nearly 75% of all life on Earth. And this was not an instantaneous, painless extermination-- the debris from the impact filled the Earth's atmosphere and blocked the sun, causing most plants and animals to freeze to death.   For all of our planet's history, it has been the stage for cataclysms and catastrophes, violent conflicts, and organisms annihilating each other. But it is only within the past few hundred millennia that one particular species of hairless bipedal ape has developed the mental quirk known as morality, and projected it onto the natural world.  For all our accomplishments, we are still just one species. A species that has done quite a lot, but still just one out of millions. To decide that we should be the sole arbiters of what is ""good"" and ""evil"" in nature, when such things have been happening for millions of years before our primate ancestors even descended from the trees, is the height of conceit.   Imagine, for example, looking at it from a tarantula hawk wasp's perspective. An intelligent tarantula hawk wasp would probably regard it as self-evident that it was the most ""morally superior"" species in the world. ""Human beings butcher millions of animals a year to feed themselves, and pollute the planet in doing so, rather than painlessly eating a single paralyzed spider,"" it might say. ""They are clearly immoral creatures who promote suffering"". The tarantula hawk wasp would be wrong, of course, but no more so than those humans who believe human morality ought to apply to the rest of the natural world.   Do I think nature is inherently good, or inherently bad? No. Good and evil are constructs of the human mind, and nature is a far older, far more inscrutable thing. Anyone who looks at tarantula hawk wasps, at the violent mating habits of dolphins, or at the manner in which Komodo dragons eat their prey alive, and declares nature to be evil is missing the point. Nature is completely outside the scope of human morality. It cannot, and should not, be judged by such standards.",doğasever,q0w2cf

"Ecosadism and Aesthetics One source of moral understanding is via emotions and intuitions. These are often more strongly felt than those moral conclusions reached by argumentation. This poses a problem for those concerned by the state of animals in nature, as humans suffer from biophilia.   > ""Biophilia"" is an innate affinity of life or living systems. The term was first used by Erich Fromm to describe a psychological orientation of being attracted to all that is alive and vital. Wilson uses the term in a related sense when he suggests that biophilia describes ""the connections that human beings subconsciously seek with the rest of life."" He proposed the possibility that the deep affiliations humans have with other life forms and nature as a whole are rooted in our biology. Both positive and negative (including phobic) affiliations toward natural objects (species, phenomenon) as compared to artificial objects are evidence for biophilia.  There are subreddits dedicated to the brutality of nature, and by looking at many comments, it seems like many visitors are getting a kind of thrill from these depictions of horror. They are suffering from what I'll call 'ecosadism'; a psychological condition where someone takes pleasure from the gruesome state of nature. There is a psychological disconnection in that most ecosadists probably don't want to harm animals themselves. Many nature documentaries and the subreddits I alluded to are all forms of widely accepted ecosadistic culture. If we compare ecosadism to sexual sadism, there are some points of difference. Sexual sadism can have an ethical outlet with a consenting partner. If this is strictly adhered to, it is difficult to argue that sexual sadism is a moral problem. The sadist has feelings which are potentially problematic but can undertake actions to stay moral. The situation of the ecosadist is different: their pleasure arises precisely from doing nothing at all: it is the state of nature itself, outside of human agency, that generates the ecosadist's material. While this *might* not be an issue (one can have certain feelings but act otherwise), it likely is not: an ecosadist probably won't feel motivated to change nature.    A second problem is aesthetics. Natural and vital environments are considered more beautiful than barren wastelands, destroyed habitats or artificial places. At around 8:44, Zizek starts discussing how we must reimagine nature, finding beauty and spirituality in artificiality.  One thing we can do is to seek out precisely those environments deemed 'dead' by many, and seek aesthetic pleasure in them. If we manage to do this, we will be one step closer in uniting the three transcendentals: truth, beauty, and goodness.",doğasever,kf829h

"Tired of seeing people take the side of the animal in unprovoked wildlife attacks Edit: Revised a bit for clarity. Never did I intend to accuse anyone here of the behaviors I'm talking about. I'm talking about a vocal minority in the environmentalist community that I have issues with. I was frankly very surprised that there are so many people in a community like this that sympathize with the vocal minority I'm talking about. I also rewrote things in a more neutral tone. At the time I wrote this post, I was very upset at some people who were a part of the said vocal minority.  If nature is terrible, why can't animals be? Why is it really so inappropriate to presume that animals can be good and bad? That each bear is an individual? Aren't humans driven by instinct as well? -- although perhaps to a lesser extent, granted.  ""You entered their territory"" ""The animal was just stalking you because it was curious"" ""You could have deescalated it from attacking you peacefully"" ""You should have waited a bit longer""  These kinds of conversations usually start off with an unfounded assumption like one of the above. It's not really clear whether the intent is advice or blame until the conversation turns sour. There's a difference between offering preventative advice and holding someone responsible for something that was completely out of their control (short of never going on a hike in the first place). We all know well that if that was a person and not an animal, things would be interpreted very differently, even if it was a person who didn't know any better than a bear, like someone having a psychotic episode.  Anyway, I'm just tired of people acting like nature is innocent. Aggression and violence are being excused on the account of instinct, even though instinct can cause human beings to behave violently as well. If these people thought about things in terms of being anti-violence rather than in terms of their overengineered sense of morality, nature would terrify them.   Bears are not usually aggressive, so why try to defend an aggressive one's behavior? I'm not saying they should be punished (obviously, that would be pretty unfair to the animal), just that there is such a thing as a victim of nature. If you can really say nature is terrible, why can't you say that an animal can be?  Look up videos, articles, news flashes, etc. of rangers, police, animal control, etc. putting down rogue bears and other animals and you'll see the kinds of comments and reactions I'm talking about.   Even worse than wildlife attack victim blame is dog attack victim blame. When you look into cases involving dogs, like of people putting down aggressive dogs and stuff, the dog could have just charged them and bitten them completely unprovoked and some people will still blame the victim as the one in the wrong. I'm not saying that I support the assholes (usually police) who shoot dogs prematurely either.    Of course we all have a responsibility to make sure that we are well-read and prepared when we suspect we may have an encounter with any animal. However, blaming a victim is NEVER okay under any circumstances -- especially not the victims that didn't even try fighting back, for fk's sake.  Responsibility ALWAYS needs to be a separate conversation. They need to stop this ""they were asking for it"" bs. It's sickening. I doubt most people could think straight during an impending animal attack anyway... A lot of people would probably lose their minds even if a bear just ran across the trail in front of them.  For whatever reason that's as arbitrary as my disagreement with you, you can believe that animals are indistinguishable husks that aren't any more relevant to morality than rocks. Fine. But when one is playing the role of a violent aggressor, I hope you have a bit more nuance.  There are places like NY where bear spray isn't technically legal.  That really needs to change.",doğasever,w1ld3f

"“On a certain fallacy concerning the Darwinian concept of adaptation” by David Olivier >Due to the mechanism commonly called ""natural selection"", organisms tend to adapt to their environment. This adaptation can be described as an optimization process, which would ideally lead the organism to be perfectly adapted to its environment.   >   >The idea of ​​adaptation, or optimization, evokes perfection, harmony, bliss. The harmony between two partners is a reciprocal relationship. It is therefore easy to forget that adaptation is asymmetrical: the organism adapts to the environment and not the reverse. The organism's genome, and therefore its phenotype, is (ideally) the best possible for a given environment; this environment, on the other hand, is generally not the best possible for the organism, as well as the latter has adapted to it.   >   >For example, the following statement is familiar to anyone who has attended a debate on vegan cat food: ""A cat should be fed meat because this is the diet for it."" The expression is a *non-sequitur* . In a certain environment in which, for example, cooked and low-fiber plant material was not available, the genome and physiology of the cat have evolved to become the best possible for the cat to develop. flourish in that environment. It does not follow that the environment has become the best possible for the physiology of the cat.   >   >Another example will be even clearer. In an environment populated by predators - say, foxes - hares have developed long, strong hind limbs that have increased their ability to flee. This adaptation involved a compromise, as is typically the case: between the investment of resources in the members and the risk of being caught by a fox. Larger hind limbs would mean better chances of survival and therefore of producing offspring, but also less resources for the production and breeding of this offspring. A perfectly adapted hare will have a hind limb size which maximizes the expectation of the number of young, taking into account the density of foxes in the environment. This obviously does not mean that for this perfectly optimized hare, the best environment is one that has this density of foxes. Indeed, this hare, although it is optimally adapted to an environment containing a certain density of foxes, would fare even better in an environment without foxes at all.   >   >However, the adaptation of an organism to an environment may make it incapable of subsisting in certain other environments that were initially favorable to it. For example we are advised, when we take a cactus as a houseplant, not to water it too much because it is adapted to a dry environment. We have seen the error in this reasoning, but the conclusion may be correct, that is to say that de facto cacti do not grow in a humid environment. I don't know the reason; but I can imagine, for the purposes of the example, that cacti may have lost their defenses against parasites such as mold, these being rare in dry environments. A higher humidity than in its natural environment can be favorable to the cactus by better satisfying its water needs, but moreover unfavorable by inducing the development of molds. The result is that not only is the cactus suitable for a dry environment, but also that the environment appears ""suitable"" - optimal - for the cactus.   >   >This is only true, however, in a limited sense: when we consider only a limited set of possible environments. In another environment, where there is more water but where mold has been eliminated - by pesticides or otherwise - the cactus can grow even better than in its dry ""natural"" environment.   >   >In the case of cats and their food, it can very well be said that meat is the best food for cats, among the types of food available in the natural or traditional environment of a cat. But well-designed vegan artificial formulas can be even better.   >   >Harmony, I noted, is a reciprocal relationship, and adaptation is not reciprocal.

"Suffering Suffering is an innate characteristic of sentient life. It is in fact a necessary component of sentient life, without it, sentient life would not survive long (assuming it is even possible to be sentient without the ability to suffer). Suffering is a mechanism that has been bestowed upon sentient life by evolution to dissuade sentient beings from doing things which have been proven through natural selection to be less adaptive and therefore thwart the organism’s chances of survival and procreation. Suffering can also occur due to psychological conditioning whereby one may be convinced that something is bad and therefore becomes sufferable. An example of this is homosexuality in the context of Christianity: “[You must not]( [lie]( [with]( [a man]( [as with]( [a woman;]( [that]( [is an abomination.]( - Leviticus 18. Many homosexuals have and continue to suffer because they believe in the bible and Christianity and therefore believe they are doing something “abominable”, which makes it sufferable. Stated more concisely, suffering conditions one not to do things which are averse to one’s own survival and procreation and/or which one has been psychologically persuaded to believe are bad. This conditioning is accomplished by the body sending a negative sensation to the organism in response to them performing an action which is maladaptive in the former case, or an action that is believed to be bad in the latter. In either case, suffering is used as a mechanism for operant conditioning of an organism. An individual performs an action and is then stimulated with a form of suffering if it is a maladaptive behaviour or if the organism believes it to be bad.",doğasever,dhi9bt

And there will be no end to their malignity; by their strong limbs we shall see a great portion of the trees of the vast forests laid low throughout the universe; and, when they are filled with food the satisfaction of their desires will be to deal death and grief and labour and wars and fury to every living thing; and from their immoderate pride they will desire to rise towards heaven, but the too great weight of their limbs will keep them down.

"On ""the balance of nature"" myth It's important to challenge this heavily prevalent myth. It leads people to reject the idea that we should aid sentient individuals in nature, because of the fear that doing so is upsetting an inherent natural balance.  Below is a collection of quotes from the book *The Balance of Nature: Ecology's Enduring Myth* (2009):  1:  >Historically, the notion of a balance of nature is part observational, part metaphysical, and not scientific in any way. It is an example of an ancient belief system called teleology, the notion that what we call nature has a predetermined destiny associated with its component parts, and that these parts, mosquitoes included, all fit together into an integrated, well-ordered system that was created by design. Such a belief in the harmony of nature requires purpose, a purpose presumably imposed by the goodness and profound wisdom of a deity (or deities). Such a view of how nature functions dominated human thought for millennia. For many, likely most, it remains a worldview today.  2:  >The “balance of nature” is a paradigm, a venerable and little-questioned belief about how nature is organized. Almost anyone will tell you they think there is some kind of “balance” in nature and that humans tend to upset that balance. Numerous websites are devoted to it, and the history of the concept has been well documented. Humans create paradigms for a number of obvious reasons. We wish to make sense of our world as well as the universe of which it is part, but in doing so, we wish to simplify and unify information that, at first glance, appears to be hopelessly complex and disparate. We also wish to feel empowered, to have the sense that we really know about something of major significance to us.  3:  >Because culture provides humans with the ability to greatly alter nature, and because such alterations often result in extreme change to ecosystems, it is understandable that humans view themselves as having disturbed nature’s natural balance. Particularly in Western culture, humans perceive themselves as largely apart from nature, a dualism that isolates humans from nature as well as often putting them at odds with nature.  4:  >Deer have increased in the absence of natural predators. So does that represent an imbalance of nature? Most would readily say yes. But what then is the optimum density of white-tailed deer? How many predators should there be? Doesn’t much of the answer ultimately depend on the quality of plant food available to the deer? Won’t deer populations that become dense be more susceptible to bacterial and viral pathogens, or perhaps parasites, and won’t that “naturally” lower the population density? Why are deer populations “balanced” by hunting pressure but not from eventual starvation due to loss of plant food? Do predators such as wolves and coyotes balance the deer population and pathogens such as bacteria and fungi not?  5:  >It is a simple thing to observe a blue jay in an oak forest. It is a much more complicated thing to measure all of the activities of blue jays in an oak forest. At a certain scale of space and time the relationship between blue jays, oaks, and masting seems to become clear. But always remember, the balance of nature is a metaphor, not a reality.  6:  >Lions, as everyone knows, occupy the top of the Eltonian food chain (chapter 6), the apex of nature’s food pyramid. One of the most common beliefs about the balance of nature is based on food chains. Early in my life I heard a defense of hunting, to whit, “If it were not for hunters, the deer, rabbits, ducks, quail, pheasants, etc. would overrun us.” I was confused by this assertion, as it was clear to me that blue jays, robins, chipmunks, box turtles, and virtually everything else was never hunted and yet we were apparently not overrun by non-game species. I am not arguing here against hunting, merely the uncritical belief that hunters control prey populations. On the one hand, maybe, and on the other hand, maybe not.  7:  >Food chains, more accurately described as food webs, are real and represent complex interactions among species. Food web dynamics is a major area of ecological research and may be thought of as analogous to economic interdependencies. How stable is the economy? We humans worry about economic stability, and we know perfectly well that things can and do change quickly in matters of economics. The same is true for natural food webs. Just as the collapse of a major company or bank will send deep ripples throughout the stock market that eventually find their way to the general consumer, so it is with food webs. Economics is no more balanced than nature, and in nature, as in economics, things change.  **Note:** The book is itself arguing for the preservation of nature from an environmentalist perspective rather than one considering the welfare of sentient individuals.",doğasever,a888zx

"“Whichever way man may look upon the earth, he is oppressed with the suffering incident to life...” — Clarence Darrow >Whichever way man may look upon the earth, he is oppressed with the suffering incident to life. It would almost seem as though the earth had been created with malignity and hatred. If we look at what we are pleased to call the lower animals, we behold a universal carnage. We speak of the seemingly peaceful woods, but we need only look beneath the surface to be horrified by the misery of that underworld. Hidden in the grass and watching for its prey is the crawling snake which swiftly darts upon the toad or mouse and gradually swallows it alive; the hapless animal is crushed by the jaws and covered with slime, to be slowly digested in furnishing a meal. The snake knows nothing about sin or pain inflicted upon another; he automatically grabs insects and mice and frogs to preserve his life. The spider carefully weaves his web to catch the unwary fly, winds him into the fatal net until paralyzed and helpless, then drinks his blood and leaves him an empty shell. The hawk swoops down and snatches a chicken and carries it to its nest to feed its young. The wolf pounces on the lamb and tears it to shreds. The cat watches at the hole of the mouse until the mouse cautiously comes out, then with seeming fiendish glee he plays with it until tired of the game, then crunches it to death in his jaws. The beasts of the jungle roam by day and night to find their prey; the lion is endowed with strength of limb and fang to destroy and devour almost any animal that it can surprise or overtake. There is no place in the woods or air or sea where all life is not a carnage of death in terror and agony. Each animal is a hunter, and in turn is hunted, by day and night. No landscape is so beautiful or day so balmy but the cry of suffering and sacrifice rends the air. When night settles down over the earth the slaughter is not abated. Some creatures see best at night, and the outcry of the dying and terrified is always on the wind. Almost all animals meet death by violence and through the most agonizing pain. With the whole animal creation there is nothing like a peaceful death. Nowhere in nature is there the slightest evidence of kindness, of consideration, or a feeling for the suffering and the weak, except in the narrow circle of brief family life.  — Clarence Darrow, [*The Story of My Life*]( (1932)",doğasever,cwo4dp

"“For those who assert that nature has intrinsic value...” — Peter Singer >For those who assert that nature has intrinsic value, the comparison of that value with other values, such as the well-being of humans and animals, becomes an insoluble difficulty. My own view, which I have defended elsewhere, is that intrinsic value is to be found only in conscious experiences (not in all conscious experiences but only in positive ones). On this view, nature itself, independently of the sentient beings whose lives it makes possible, does not have intrinsic value, and so the difficulty of comparing its intrinsic value with the intrinsic value of the experiences of sentient beings does not arise.  — Peter Singer, *The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically* (2015)",doğasever,bs6axk
"Comparing Perspectives of Nature: Environmentalists and Wild-Animal Welfare Advocates **Quotes**  Environmentalist — “[Different Views of Nature](  >Sometimes in our rush to save the world we forget to enjoy it. We work incessantly to try to prevent the loss of habitats, species and ecosystems. We are driven by a need to protect and conserve as much of the natural world as possible for future generations and in the process we can forget to enjoy the beauty of nature all around us. Give yourself a break today and soak up the pleasure that nature provides us if we only take the time to stop and wonder.  Wild-Animal Welfare Advocate — “[Medicine vs. Deep Ecology](  >Nature is babies with teeth growing up into their skulls. It's animals with open wounds rotting over without treatment. It's swollen feet and hunger and painful, infectious blindness. I see a healthy-looking animal getting ripped open and eaten alive by a predator, and while I flinch, I honestly think ""Wow, it looked healthy - it was really lucky that only those last 30 minutes were intensely painful.""  Environmentalist — “[Beauty in Nature](  >There is thus an emotional or affective component in the beauty of the intellect just as there is in the immediate beauty of perception.  If we destroy the natural world, we take away the things that we can marvel at and experience awe towards in these two ways.  And this experience of the beautiful through the intellect may reinforce our attributing value to nature here as well, but a deeper kind of value, the intrinsic value I talked about in the last essay.  Here it is not only that nature is valuable because it is beautiful, but nature is beautiful because it possesses intrinsic value, grounded in its intelligible structure. Thus we see a close parallel between goodness and beauty in nature.  We can find an objective basis for goodness and beauty in nature, namely its intelligible structure, but also see that nature is valuable and beautiful *for us*, with the particular apparatus that nature has given us for navigating our way through the world.  Wild-Animal Welfare Advocate — [*Rightness as Fairness: A Moral and Political Theory*](  >On the one hand, animals in nature face all kinds of coercive horrors, such as starvation and disease. According to the Principle of Negative Fairness, these natural horrors are a moral issue: we should care about the coercive horrors that animals experience in nature. Simply leaving animals alone in nature – however much animal advocates may like to romanticize it – is, on Rightness as Fairness, not fair to animals. Just as there is nothing fair about leaving fellow human beings to suffer or die from starvation or disease, so too is there nothing fair about leaving animals to suffer and die from such things in nature.  Environmentalist — [A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf](   >On no subject are our ideas more warped and pitiable than on death. ... Let children walk with nature, let them see the beautiful blendings and communions of death and life, their joyous inseparable unity, as taught in woods and meadows, plains and mountains and streams of our blessed star, and they will learn that death is stingless indeed, and as beautiful as life, and that the grave has no victory, for it never fights.  Wild-Animal Welfare Advocate — [“Golden](  >Many humans look at nature from an aesthetic perspective and think in terms of biodiversity and the health of ecosystems, but forget that the animals that inhabit these ecosystems are individuals and have their own needs. Disease, starvation, predation, ostracism, and sexual frustration are endemic in so-called healthy ecosystems. The great taboo in the animal rights movement is that most suffering is due to natural causes. Any proposal for remedying this situation is bound to sound utopian, but my dream is that one day the sun will rise on Earth and all sentient creatures will greet the new day with joy.  **Analysis**  Comparing these perspectives we see that environmentalists and conservationists see nature as a holistic system of unity, strongly value it aesthetically and how it benefits humans. By extension, they also value natural habitats, ecosystems, biodiversity, and certain nonhuman animal species and populations. They generally see nature as an inherently balanced system and that nonhuman animals in the wild by and large have good lives (when left alone by humans). If not, then that's just part of how the system is, and who are we to question this or seek to change it (it is in fact arrogant to do so).  On the other hand, wild-animal welfare advocates take a nonspeciesist perspective and value the wellbeing and interests of sentient individuals intrinsically. They may still value nature aesthetically but appreciate that the lives of sentient individuals in the wild generally have horrible lives and suffer mainly due to non-anthropogenic natural processes. To them, helping nonhuman animals in the wild should be a moral priority.",doğasever,bfdfhz

"“Nature knows nothing about right and wrong, good and evil, pleasure and pain; she simply acts...” — Clarence Darrow >Nature knows nothing about right and wrong, good and evil, pleasure and pain; she simply acts. She creates a beautiful woman, and places a cancer on her cheek. She may create an idealist, and kill him with a germ. She creates a fine mind, and then burdens it with a deformed body. And she will create a fine body, apparently for no use whatever. She may destroy the most wonderful life when its work has just commenced. She may scatter tubercular germs broadcast throughout the world. She seemingly works with no method, plan or purpose. She knows no mercy nor goodness. Nothing is so cruel and abandoned as Nature. To call her tender or charitable is a travesty upon words and a stultification of intellect. No one can suggest these obvious facts without being told that he is not competent to judge Nature and the God behind Nature. If we must not judge God as evil, then we cannot judge God as good. In all the other affairs of life, man never hesitates to classify and judge, but when it comes to passing on life, and the responsibility of life, he is told that it must be good, although the opinion beggars reason and intelligence and is a denial of both. Emotionally, I shall no doubt act as others do to the last moment of my existence. With my last breath I shall probably try to draw another, but, intellectually, I am satisfied that life is a serious burden, which no thinking, humane person would wantonly inflict on some one else.  — Clarence Darrow, [*The Story of My Life*]( (1932)",doğasever,a6el0r

"Does believing nature is horrible really have to mean you believe humans would be better not existing too? I think when you look at the nature of how Darwinian life works and the amount of offspring most species have, combined with the likely ability to feel pain of so many animals and the tendency of most  forms of death to be very painful, it's clear that nature is mostly just horrible and it would be good thing if it were not to exist. And you don't have to have a belief that there is no value in the positive experiences of life and there's no moral difference between a perfectly blissful life and no life at all, or that no one at all is capable of having a life worth living, to believe that, you simply have to recognize that the average animal has no opportunity in life to have any worthwhile experience that could help ""balance out"" the bad. I'm not the only one to note this, like Brian Tomasik mentioned this too that these beliefs on animal suffering are completely compatible with an optimistic, mostly positive utilitarian belief.  &#x200B;  So why, then, does nearly everyone on this site seem to be an extremely pessimistic, negative utilitarian antinatalist who not only thinks the short lives of these animals with no redeeming features are not worth living but that the rich, complex lives of humans are not worth living either? There is such an immense difference between the life of what is likely the majority of sentient beings, a baby animal who dies a painful death with little to no time to experience anything else in life, and the average human's life, that it seems like a very reasonable opinion to think the former is not worth living but the latter is and that it would be a net positive to create more lives like that, assuming they aren't having a serious negative impact on the lives of other animals. But yet I've never seen a single person who focuses on the immense suffering in nature outweighing any good in it who is not also an antinatalist, if not promortalist, with regards to humans. It doesn't make logical sense that these beliefs would be so uniformly scared. But the scariest part is I think I GET why this is. I used to think it was obvious that life is worth living and have such joy in it - it wasn't like I led a completely happy life and didn't have my real issues and struggles, but it seemed obvious that it was all a beautiful, worthwhile thing - not just in the sense I took it for granted but in the sense that I truly, vividly FELT it. But as soon as I started thinking about the suffering in nature, that all changed. As soon as the obvious cases of the phenomenon forced me to think about cases in which life was so predominated by suffering that it was not worth living, I couldn't help obsessively looking for where the line was where it became no longer worthwhile, even in my own life. Every happy thing I experienced felt frivolous and nothing compared to the extreme suffering I could imagine happening to me. Even though there was nothing in my beliefs about nature that had anything to do with how happy and worthwhile my life is, or other humans', the very thought of it was so corrupting it seemed to make any happiness meaningless. It's almost like realizing the suffering of nature and thinking in terms of life being worth living is like a mental virus that makes you reevaluate your own life and those of the people around you negatively, even if it isn't directly saying anything about your life.  &#x200B;  And everywhere I look on pages like this I'm being told by things like antinatalist sites that none of what I felt about life was real. Stockholm syndrome. An addiction. A product of extreme privilege. A false, pre-programmed belief created by genes' desire to perpetuate themselves. It feels like I'm being gaslighted, made to question everything... and I don't really get the logic anyway, why wouldn't it be possible that the evolutionary imperative to not kill yourself would produce a genuine experience of life being worth living rather than the illusion of it despite it being objectively false? But I've heard this reasoning so much that I can't help feeling that I must be the one who is wrong and I'm just missing something. I still want to believe that if we are able to do something about the worse-than-nonexistence state that nature is, even if it means destroying it, the living beings that remain will live a happy life - always a deeply flawed one, of course, but one that at the same time is worth exulting in. That there can be a happy ending for life that doesn't involve it just all being destroyed like the mistake it is, that the wonderful, valuable things that came by accident from this mess can be freed and exalted rather than destroyed with all the rests, or turning out to be an illusion that never existed in the first place. But it seems that, even though it logically shouldn't be so, that belief is just incompatible with anything but sheer worship of nature.  &#x200B;  Edited the post a bit to clarify since I felt the replies were missing some of the questions I was asking.",doğasever,u34nr3

"What made developing nations stop driving large animals to extinction? When Europeans first came to settle North America, they absolutely ravaged the native cougar, bear, and wolf populations. Today, these animals live in only about half of the range they lived in about 300 years ago. Similar interactions have been noted elsewhere, such as in England, where wolves and bears were driven to total extirpation, as well as lions on mainland Europe even longer ago than that. India hired people to kill large numbers of tigers as recent as a century ago.  What changed? Why do people no longer want to wipe out predator populations? Why would people attempt to keep a stable population of a dangerous animal, and even try to help them repopulate?   Some places in non-urbanized Africa today still celebrate the killing of a lion or an elephant. So this seems like a developed-world mindset.",doğasever,zct7cb

"Extracts from Richard Dawkins' A Devil's Chaplain (2003) 1.  >Nature is not cruel, only pitilessly indifferent. This is one of the hardest lessons for humans to learn. We cannot admit that things might be neither good nor evil, neither cruel nor kind, but simply callous--indifferent to all suffering, lacking all purpose.  2.  >Blindness to suffering is an inherent consequence of natural selection. Nature is neither kind nor cruel but indifferent.  3.  >Treating evolution as though it were a good thing is a point of view advanced by English biologist Julian Huxley in the 1920s and 1930s. Huxley tried to make evolution into a kind of religion. In contrast, his grandfather, Thomas Henry Huxley, thought that evolution was a thoroughly bad thing, and I agree with him. I would hold it up as an awful warning.  4.  >The shark may outswim you, the cheetah outrun you, the swift outfly you, the capuchin outclimb you, the elephant outpower you, the redwood outlast you. But you have the biggest gifts of all: the gift of understanding the ruthlessly cruel process that gave us all existence \[and the\] gift of revulsion against its implications.  5.  >If, as my wife suggests to me, selfish genes are Frankensteins and all life their monster, it is only we that can complete the fable by turning against our creators.

"The Reality of Hunter-gatherer tribes Many in our culture romanticize the past. Oftentimes, this is due to conservative values and a longing for things to return to the way they were. Other times the romanticization of the past goes a step further, arguing that pre-civilization societies were good.   Proponents cite the alleged egalitarianism in hunter-gatherer tribes, and cite the shorter work weeks. Books like [Ishmael]( are popular reads for those who hold this view. Karl Marx even emphasized hunter-gathers as exhibiting a form of ""primitive communism"" and I have personally seen the ""Hunter gatherers lived better lives than we do"" meme crop up in my education. This is a myth that must be dispelled.  From Steven Pinker,   >According to two ethnographic surveys, 65 to 70 percent of hunter-gatherer groups are at war at least every two years, 90 percent engage in war at least once a generation, and virtually all the rest report a cultural memory of war in the past 67  And those wars are not playful either. Again, from Steven Pinker,  >Modern Western countries, even in their most war-torn centuries, suffered no more than around a quarter of the average death rate of nonstate societies, and less than a tenth of that for the most violent one.  From Wikipedia,  >Researchers Gurven and Kaplan have estimated that around 57% of hunter-gatherers reach the age of 15. Of those that reach 15 years of age, 64% continue to live to or past the age of 45. This places the life expectancy between 21 and 37 years. They further estimate that 70% of deaths are due to diseases of some kind, 20% of deaths come from violence or accidents and 10% are due to degenerative diseases.  Now, I think there is good case to be made that hunter-gatherer tribes are not even egalitarian by modern standards, but this is a bit subjective. Something to remember is that non-hedonic values were also undermined in our pre-civilization days. Hunter-gatherer tribes have no knowledge of mathematics, written language, and science. Their beliefs are usually shaped heavily by primitive religion and magic. Steven Pinker notes,  >Witchcraft is one of the most common motives for revenge among hunter-gatherer and tribal societies  He also cites an anecdote which provides evidence that humans do not care for animal welfare in their natural state,  >When I asked an anthropologist friend about  the treatment of animals by the hunter-gatherers she had worked with, she  replied:   >>That is perhaps the hardest part of being an anthropologist. They sensed my weakness and would sell me all kinds of baby animals with descriptions of what they would do to them otherwise. I used to take them far into the desert and release them, they would track them, and bring them back to me for sale again!   I am not saying this to look down upon the modern people who live these lifestyles. Rather, my point is that we shouldn't be so eager to dismiss the harsh reality of pre-technological life.

"Though some groups do profit more from civilization than others, it does seems like a reason for people working together is to defend themselves from the cruelties of nature ‘’ But how ungrateful, how short-sighted after all, to strive for the abolition of civilization! What would then remain would be a state of nature, and that would be far harder to bear. It is true that nature would not demand any restrictions of instinct from us, she would let us do as we liked; but she has her own particularly eﬀective method of restricting us. She destroys us coldly, cruelly, relentlessly, as it seems to us, and possibly through the very things that occasioned our satisfaction. It was precisely because of these dangers with which nature threatens us that we came together and created civilization, which is also, among other things, intended to make our communal life possible.

"What if there were a technology that reliably increased the IQ of whoever used it by an average of 15 points? This is the premise of many dystopian plots. [Gattaca]( is probably the most well known movie that presents this theme. The popular consensus is that such a technology would have disasterous effects: a vast lower class would be oppressed by an upper echelon of greed. Wealth inequality would rise dramatically. A form of discrimination more apalling than anything we know about would supersede racism and society would become elitist and authoritarian.   Or maybe not?  Let's forget for a moment that the potential of germline engineering to reduce suffering in humans and non-humans extends beyond intelligence boosts. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the technology does eventually get used to increase the intelligence of a special rich class. What then?  In fact, a technology that increases general intelligence has *already been invented*. The [Flynn Effect]( refers to the well documented rise in average intelligence in the world during the 20th century, and continuing into the 21st century for some nations. This rise in intellligence was too short for it to be the result of natural selection. Instead, it is generally attributed to better nutrition science and medicine, among other technological advances. Just like in Gattaca, this technology was first introduced to the rich, which allowed them to get ahead of the rest. Only now are the benefits of this widespread phenomenon being shared relatively equally, but even now it is still highly dependent on one's level of income and accident of birth.   If you ask anyone educated in the matter whether it would be *better* to go back to the time before nutrition science was invented, they would probably look at you funny before promptly saying, ""No."" Why is that? One could imagine coming up with all sorts of rationalizations that might have looked really good ex ante for resisting nutrition science. If we consider the wealth inequality objection, we might even get a somewhat good case! That is, until you look at the evidence; from [Our World In Data](  >The available long-run evidence shows that in the past, only a small elite enjoyed living conditions that would not be described as 'extreme poverty' today. But with the onset of industrialization and rising productivity, the share of people living in extreme poverty started to decrease.  Now, to be fair, wealth inequality *has* been on the rise for the last 50 years. But so has the average living condition. Almost every metric that measures human quality of life has been on the rise. Wealth inequality only measures *relative* quality of life.  And I don't want to come off as overly pro-technology. Despite the subreddit, I don't believe in separating the world into two forces: nature as evil, and technology as good. It happens that nature is *generally* bad, and it happens that technology is *generally* good, but I don't want to be dogmatic. I just see people performing the exact opposite inference, and I find it absurd.   Would genetic engineering really be *that* bad? Or is this just another instance of the pro-nature, pro-status quo bias? I haven't completely made up my mind, but I'm pretty skeptical of the most alarming claims.",doğasever,a710wn

A being so powerful and so full of knowledge as a God who could create the universe, is to our finite minds omnipotent and omniscient, and it revolts our understanding to suppose that his benevolence is not unbounded, for what advantage can there be in the sufferings of millions of the lower animals throughout almost endless time?

"Extracts from “Do Ecosystems Exist?” — Alan R. Walker Posting [this essay]( because it's important to challenge the idea that ecosystems (abstract concepts) deserve moral consideration over the well-being of the sentient individuals that exist within them (emphasis added):  >One hundred years ago several people enquiring about how the world of plants and animals works developed the idea of ecological system. The system was derived from analogy with the designs of mechanical and electrical engines, and business organisations. These had clearly defined flows of materials, energy, and information. They had their own developmental history from invention of simple forms to complex mature forms. In the language of modern technology these are cybernetic things, amenable to the techniques of systems analysis.   >   >Soon a problem arose with this concept when it was promoted as ecosystems being literal organisms, entirely equivalent with an organism like a worm or a whale. Some researchers strongly disagreed, pointing out that unlike worms and whales ecosystems have no distinct boundaries, are not autonomously self-reproducing, and seem to have no mechanism to evolve coherently by Darwinian natural selection or genetic drift. **Worse still, this idea of literal organisms, even super-organisms, had overtones of things designed by an external deity.**   >   >These objections went unheeded, and the ecosystem as organism idea penetrated popular knowledge of natural history. Many people viewed an ecosystem as a well defined and coherent thing where numerous plants and animals lived closely interconnected, all cooperating for their common good. The idea remains as generally popular now as it was then.   >   >Definitions of ecosystem are ambiguous. ""An ecosystem is a system involving the interactions between a community and its non-living environment. A community is a group of interdependent plants and animals inhabiting the same region and interacting with each other through food and other relationships."" These inspire questions to which there are no easy answers. What size is this region and how are its boundaries defined? Is the timescale over which these interactions are measured that of a research project, or since the last ice-age, or since most of the species in the system first evolved? How many of these interdependencies are true mutualisms, or looser non-obligate symbioses, or non-existent? To avoid confusions in this essay, the neutral term assemblage will be used.   >   >**These difficulties lead to the proposition that ecosystems are neither organisms nor any kind of physical entity. They have no mass and no volume. A tree has these properties, a forest also has them. An ecosystem has neither because ecosystem is a concept, it is a paradigm, a method of thinking about the living natural world. A concept of ecosystem works by the firing of neurons in the brains of ecologists**.   >   >...   >   >The ecosystem concept, especially by its mathematical models, explains the positive relationship between diversity and stability as the result of varied levels of interdependencies between populations of species that act as buffers or dampers that absorb disturbances.

"The road to finally beating ‘nature’ one day is finding out what exactly underpins the ‘logical order’ of objective reality as defined in physics/philosophy and how it can be broken down or rearranged in turn For starters IK, it seems very far away right now and might seem like a crazy idea to some but it can’t be that hard to get some general idea if we live with it all the time. It also helps you be hopeful in thinking a bit about how it might happen.  Whatever it is, it seems another name that we could call it is the ‘objective narrative’ because it seems to underpin everything no matter what. It’s the unchanging and ruthless set of processes that we can observe with ‘logic’, so as we might call: ‘The logical order of natural reality’.  Finding out what counts right now as sabotaging natural logical processes in philosophical terms would be a stepping stone to eventually the best ever discovery possible (That is ultimately finding out what exact processes are responsible for making up the logical composure of ‘nature’ we are trying to sabotage right now). Do you think if we blocked Darwinian Evolution from functioning somehow by intervening that it would count?  To put it simply, the definition of truely ‘going against nature’ is to do something that opposes (Which is more of a philosophical discussion) or the ‘more actual scale we can hope for’ which involves breaking down or rearranging said ‘objective logical order of natural reality’ in any way, shape or form. The latter is something we haven’t learnt to do or a process we don’t have much of an idea yet to define.  From one hypothesis I have it seems to be whatever thing ultimately defines the way things work in ‘the laws of mathematics, chemistry, darwinian evolution and physics as we know it’, so that only certain possibilities are allowed while others are not by setting the mathematical processes in how ‘nature’ works. If that seems to be on the right track just a little.  If you have your own hypothesises about this, feel free to share.

"""Not just any old goal can count as the function of a system shaped by natural selection [such as] adaptations that work toward the good of the species, the harmony of the ecosystem, beauty for its own sake, benefits to entities other than the replicators that create the adaptations"" --Steven Pinker This quote is from Steven Pinker's foreword to The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology. It is relevant for this subreddit because it clarifies the meaning of adaptation in an evolutionary sense.  In my experience, people tend to ground the traits of organisms by appealing to teleology, but not all teleologies actually make any scientific sense.   I am reminded of a time when I heard someone argue that a specific primate species had evolved a ritual of self-banishing for overly aggressive males. The idea was that these males, due to the destructive potential of their aggressive nature, had a certain inclination to leave the tribe they were apart of, and that this behavior had been shaped by evolution over time since it promoted harmony. However, from a gene's point of view, this adaptation makes no sense. If an organism banished themselves from the reproductive pool, then they would have a sharply reduced chance of passing their genes on. We should therefore not expect any such ritual to exist, and should be rather confused if we find it does happen.   A careful study of adaptations, and the *true* teleology of natural selection is key to understanding why nature does not have the interests of organisms at heart. There is no force for good in nature, except if your notion of good is maximizing genetic fitness. If something good does happen in the course of evolution, it is only an accident, as some good things are merely incidentally aligned with genetic fitness.",doğasever,c9ltcd

We know, that, in the individual man, consciousness grows from a dim glimmer to its full light, whether we consider the infant advancing in years, or the adult emerging from slumber and swoon. We know, further, that the lower animals possess, though less developed, that part of the brain which we have every reason to believe to be the organ of consciousness in man.  I find it fascinating that in the nearly 150 years since, this is remains one of the go-to arguments that animals are indeed conscious.

"“The lioness sinks her scimitar talons into the zebra's rump...” — Christopher McGowan >The lioness sinks her scimitar talons into the zebra's rump. They rip through the tough hide and anchor deep into the muscle. The startled animal lets out a loud bellow as its body hits the ground. An instant later the lioness releases her claws from its buttocks and sinks her teeth into the zebra's throat, choking off the sound of terror. Her canine teeth are long and sharp, but an animal as large as a zebra has a massive neck, with a thick layer of muscle beneath the skin, so although the teeth puncture the hide they are too short to reach any major blood vessels. She must therefore kill the zebra by asphyxiation, clamping her powerful jaws around its trachea (windpipe), cutting off the air to its lungs. It is a slow death. If this had been a small animal, say a Thomson's gazelle (*Gazella thomsoni*) the size of a large dog, she would have bitten it through the nape of the neck; her canine teeth would then have probably crushed the vertebrae or the base of the skull, causing instant death. As it is, the zebra's death throes will last five or six minutes.  — Christopher McGown, *The Raptor and the Lamb: Predators and Prey in the Living World* (1997)",doğasever,a72ve5

"The news about two babies being born in China with unnaturally altered genomes has prompted new debate Much of the debate that I see is over whether it was unethical to risk unintentionally giving the children genetic disorders. While on the surface this is an understandable concern, it once again ultimately reflects our civilization's pro-nature bias.  From, ""Genetic disorders in children and young adults: a population study.""  >It was found that, before approximately age 25 years, greater than or equal to 53/1,000 live-born individuals can be expected to have diseases with an important genetic component.  In other words, the *natural rate* of genetic disorders is about 5.3 percent. And as far as I can tell, this measure only counts diseases with an unambiguous genetic component. Many mental and physical disorders are not well understood, but we know enough about biology to know that genes are often the primary cause, or at least greatly affect susceptibility to early-life non-infectious disease.  By a more general measure, approximately one in five people develop mental disorders and perhaps a few percent of people develop physical disabilities that are influenced by genetics. So, the risk of developing a genetically influenced disorder is somewhere between 5 and 20 percent from *natural birth*. Yet very few people are outraged over natural births.  Much like with driver-less cars, the cost of adopting too late means that many millions of people will die, become disabled, and suffer late into their life.

"What's the deal with this? I got into an argument with someone about India's plan to reintroduce cheetahs to their country by importing them from Africa. The person was complaining about it, saying that they should be importing Asiatic cheetahs instead, because African cheetahs aren't native.  But what's the difference? There are only minor genetic differences between the two, and they're considered the same species. I brought this up and the person backpedaled, then went on about how India needs to help Iran conserve their cheetah population, and then import the Asiatic cheetahs from there once there are enough. Apparently bringing in African cheetahs is just the easy option and a ""publicity stunt"". But it would be okay, apparently, if Asiatic cheetahs were extinct. What's wrong? Is Africa is too far away? Are they too different from each other? How different can they be?  And then this silliness: ""India-Iran relations span centuries marked by meaningful interactions. Indeed, the two countries shared a border until 1947 and share several common features in their language, culture and traditions. \[...\] There is/was a golden conservation opportunity here, therefore, together with the attendant benefits of positive international profile for both countries, and a continuation/deepening of a relationship between two countries with already long-standing ties.""  Hey, guess what. The Indian ecosystem doesn't care where its cheetahs came from. I'll bet if African cheetahs weren't considered a separate subspecies, this person would be fine with it. This idea is built 100% around what this person thinks is aesthetically pleasant, and not about what the ecosystem actually needs. This is a perfect example of the ""appeal to tradition"" fallacy.  Nature also doesn't care about ""international profile"". That is far more of a ""publicity stunt"" than anything. It makes zero difference from the cheetahs' perspective, or any sentient being's perspective, other than some judgemental humans.  Also, how much would shoving some cats around even make towards ""international profile"" anyway?

"The creation of synthetic or artificial elements as a hope to counter ‘nature/cosmic order’? Could it be a thing? In countering the effects of the cosmic order/‘nature’ and ultimately finding a way to beat it what do you think is the potential for synthetic elements or artificial elements for potentially helping us do so in the future/near future?  The question is what are the limits to their use in our ability to reshape things into something else much better than now?   Can we possibly create them in a way and in turn hopefully superior life to the one nature replicate that doesn’t operate on the principles of Darwinian selection someday to overtake it, or do we literally have to hope we can someday find out what the ‘force of reason’ behind the order of reality we live in is and how to destroy/change it?

"Resources exploring the widely-held belief of “the balance of nature” These resources explore the origin of this still widely-held belief, despite the fact that nature is not inherently balanced and is in fact in a state of constant change; better described with the metaphor of “the flux of nature”:  >The balance of nature has been a background assumption in natural history since antiquity, but even to the present it has seldom been closely studied. The idea of a balance of nature emerged, but only implicitly, in antiquity. During the 17th century, with an increased knowledge of natural history, the idea became a functional assumption, but within a theological rather than ecological context. In the 18th century Linnaeus defined the concept and attempted to make it the foundation of an ecological science. However, it remained tied to theology and was elaborated without critical examination. The existence of agricultural pests, the occasional occurrence of plagues of animals, and the possibility of species having become extinct were kinds of evidence which would have been difficult to reconcile with contemporary concepts. Lamarck was one of the few who perceived some anomaly, and he attempted to save the old concept by arguing that fossils represented early forms of existing species rather than extinct species. His ideas were not widely accepted. Wallace found fault with the Linnaean concept, but it was only a passing thought which he never published. Darwin attempted to assimilate the balanced-of-nature concept into his description of natural selection, but without exploring the inconsistencies between the Linnaean concept and his theory. As other naturalists shifted their interpretations of nature from static to evolving, few of them appreciated the need to change their understanding of the balance of nature accordingly. Some naturalists and ecologists who have thought seriously about balance of nature have postulated somewhat mystical supraorganismic concepts. These, like the general concepts, arose in antiquity, but unlike the general concepts they have won only limited acceptance. Balance-of-nature concepts apparently have receded in importance with the rise of ecological specialization, probably because ecologists have developed more precise concepts of productivity and ecosystem can serve about the same explanatory functions.  [Changing Concepts of the Balance of Nature]( (1970)  >IN a revision that has far-reaching implications for the way humans see the natural world and their role in it, many scientists are forsaking one of the most deeply embedded concepts of ecology: the balance of nature.   >   >Ecologists have traditionally operated on the assumption that the normal condition of nature is a state of equilibrium, in which organisms compete and coexist in an ecological system whose workings are essentially stable. Predators and prey - moose and wolves or cheetahs and gazelles, for instance - are supposed to remain in essentially static balance. Anchovies and salmon reach a maximum population that can be sustained by their oceanic environment and remain at that level. A forest grows to a beautiful, mature climax stage that becomes its naturally permanent condition.   [New Eye on Nature: The Real Constant Is Eternal Turmoil]( (1990)  > As ecology has undergone a profound shift from the notion that nature is a well-behaved, deterministic system, conservationists must no longer conceive of nature as balanced and integrated. Nature is dynamic and highly variable with open-ended trajectories contingent upon preceding events. There are not equilibrial forms of ecosystems nor ways nature should be, and there is no Mother Nature. Our understanding of science and conservation efforts need to reflect this reality and not age-old ill-founded myths and a scientific belief that is demonstrably false.    [There is No Mother Nature—There is No Balance of Nature: Culture, Ecology and Conservation]( (2005)   >The earliest concept of a balance of nature in Western thought saw it as being provided by gods but requiring human aid or encouragement for its maintenance. With the rise of Greek natural philosophy, emphasis shifted to traits gods endowed species with at the outset, rather than human actions, as key to maintaining the balance. The dominance of a constantly intervening God in the Middle Ages lessened interest in the inherent features of nature that would contribute to balance, but the Reformation led to renewed focus on such features, particularly traits of species that would maintain all of them but permit none to dominate nature. Darwin conceived of nature in balance, and his emphasis on competition and frequent tales of felicitous species interactions supported the idea of a balance of nature. But Darwin radically changed its underlying basis, from God to natural selection. Wallace was perhaps the first to challenge the very notion of a balance of nature as an undefined entity whose accuracy could not be tested. His skepticism was taken up again in the 20th century, culminating in a widespread rejection of the idea of a balance of nature by academic ecologists, who focus rather on a dynamic, often chaotic nature buffeted by constant disturbances. The balance-of-nature metaphor, however, lives on in large segments of the public, representing a fragile aspect of nature and biodiversity that it is our duty to protect.   [The “Balance of Nature”—Evolution of a Panchreston]( (2014)  >The “balance of nature” metaphor has been used to explain the functioning of natural systems from ancient times and continues to be invoked in popular culture, in spite of controversy regarding its use in the scientific community. We demonstrate that undergraduate students in the United States believe this term is descriptive of real ecological systems, and continue to do so after instruction in ecological science. A content analysis of students' definitions of the “balance of nature” and its causes varied widely with multiple, often contradictory, interpretations. A second survey confirmed that the range of definitions generated by students was representative of the larger educated population. Common responses included population regulation, species interactions, absence of disturbance and Nature. We speculate that the lack of a fixed meaning for the balance of nature term could lead to problems in education, public policy, and the transmission of ecological concepts to the general public.  [Ambiguous, circular and polysemous: students’ definitions of the “balance of nature” metaphor]( (2007)  > The last two decades have seen a conceptual shift within environmental and social sciences from an emphasis on ecosystem stability and balance to an acknowledgement of the importance of flux and change in the natural world. This has profound implications for conservation management and policy and has driven an (incomplete) transition from managing to maintain (bio)diversity and ecological stability at some historically derived “optimum” to managing to maintain important ecosystem and evolutionary processes such as nutrient cycles and migration. Here, we investigate whether this change from a “balance of nature” metaphor to a more dynamic perspective (“flux of nature”) is reflected in the representation of conservation and ecosystem management in the news media, the Internet, and the academic literature. We found that the media and the global Internet community still portray the aim of conservation science and of conservationists as being one of maintaining stability, harmony and balance.   [The (im)balance of nature: a public perception time-lag?]( (2008)  >It is a belief system that has burrowed deep in our psyches; a way of thinking that is extremely resistant to serious challenge. Yet it may be hindering our ability to intelligently consider the consequences of climate change.   >   >It is the ""balance of nature,"" a concept pretty much everyone accepts—with the notable exception of ecologists. The natural environment, as it is currently understood by science, is in a constant state of flux.   >   >Upheaval, not balance, is the norm.

"Further extracts from “On Nature” — John Stuart Mill I've [quoted this essay before]( here's a couple more extracts from “[On Nature]( (1874):  1:  >If there are any marks at all of special design in creation, one of the things most evidently designed is that a large proportion of all animals should pass their existence in tormenting and devouring other animals. They have been lavishly fitted out with the instruments necessary for that purpose; their strongest instincts impel them to it, and many of them seem to have been constructed incapable of supporting themselves by any other food. If a tenth part of the pains which have been expended in finding benevolent adaptations in all nature, had been employed in collecting evidence: to blacken the character of the Creator, what scope for comment would not have been found in the entire existence of the lower animals, divided, with scarcely an exception, into devourers and devoured, and a prey to a thousand ills from which they are denied the faculties necessary for protecting themselves! If were not obliged to believe the animal creation to be the work of a demon, it is because we need not suppose it to have been made by a Being of infinite power. But if imitation of the Creator's will as revealed in nature, were applied as a rule of action in this case, the most atrocious enormities of the worst men would be more than justified by the apparent intention of Providence that throughout all animated nature the strong should prey upon the weak.  2:  >The word Nature has two principal meanings: it either denotes the entire system of things, with the aggregate of all their properties, or it denotes things as they would be, apart from human intervention.   >   >In the first of these senses, the doctrine that man ought to follow nature is unmeaning; since man has no power to do anything else than follow nature; all his actions are done through, and in obedience to some one or many of nature's physical or mental laws.   >   >In the other sense of the term, the doctrine that man ought to follow nature, or in other words, ought to make the spontaneous course of things the model of his voluntary actions, is equally irrational and immoral.   >   >Irrational, because all human action whatever, consists in altering, and all useful action in improving, the spontaneous course of nature:   >   >Immoral, because the course of natural phenomena being replete with everything which when committed by human beings is most worthy of abhorrence, any one who endeavoured in his actions to imitate the natural course of things would be universally seen and acknowledged to be the wickedest of men.  3:  >The scheme of Nature regarded in its whole extent, cannot have had, for its sole or even principal object, the good of human or other sentient beings. What good it brings to them, is mostly the result of their own exertions. Whatsoever, in nature, gives indication of beneficent design, proves this beneficence to be armed only with limited power; and the duty of man is to co-operate with the beneficent powers, not by imitating but by perpetually striving to amend the course of nature---and bringing that part of it over which we can exercise control, more nearly into conformity with a high standard of justice and goodness.",doğasever,a8w7rm

"Does defeating the bad parts of nature negatively effect humans? I want to ask this community about it's philosophy. Firstly, I agree with the info provided on the side bar of the subreddit. At the end of the info bar it says, ""We seek to develop a community centered around the concept of defeating the bad parts of nature. "" I'm curious what you think the good parts of nature are. In addition to that I'd like to ask, would defeating the bad parts of nature somehow have a negative impact on humans; making the world inhabitable to us? As humans, we relay on the natural world for our existence, in the sense that we need air, suitable temperature, and resources. If we were for example, to disrupt how many plants receive nutrients (from decaying animals) therefor killing off many types of plants who have grown to depend on this resource, would this be wrong? If we disrupt the natural order of things does it have the potential to turn for the worst? Or is there hope that humans can defeat the bad parts of nature while finding solutions that sustain our existence. Thanks.",doğasever,ar6a6l

""Nature understand no jesting, it is always true, awlays serius, always severe, it is always right, and the errors and faults are always those of man.

As i was working as a guide in Norway i met people from over 20 countries and we talked about how accessible the nature are in their countries.  I got a lot of different answers, some were able to free camp in designated areas and in some countries it was totally prohibited.  So i was wondering how accessible is nature in your country?

"🔥 Unimaginable Vastness Here is one of my most favorite images. I reprocess it often and share it at least once a year. I captured this in early July a few years ago. There is so much to see when the sky is void of light pollution. On this night, with no moon in the sky, I was able to walk around by starlight only. It’s still plenty dark, but your eyes get used to it. Airglow, which is caused by a chemical reaction between Oxygen (glows green) and Nitrogen (glows magenta) also adds some light to the sky, even if you cannot usually see the bands with your eyes. I’ve added a second marked up image to label some of the more prominent elements in this photo, which is a panorama comprised of 11 vertical images showing 180º field of view.   In the foreground there are the fuzzy, but visible colors of three prominent wildflowers up there: Sky Pilot (Polonium eximium), Old Man of the Mountain (Tetraneuris grandiflora), and Monument Plant Frasera species) from which this ridge derives its name.  On the left/center is the Andromeda Galaxy. This galaxy is roughly the size of our own Milky Way Galaxy, but is about 2.5 million light years away. The brighter cluster of stars seen arching across this represents about 25% of the Orion Spur of the Sagittarius Arm, which is one of several spiraling arms that make up our Galaxy. To say that our solar system is tiny is a vast understatement.   My favorite part of the “core” of the Milky Way is the Dark Horse Nebula. This is only just barely visible in the darkest of sky. I could not see it with my own eyes on that night. A nebula is an area of both dark dust and luminous gases. These areas are both the result of dead stars and can be an area where new stars are born. At the end of the long upper “forelegs” of the Dark Horse are two stars. Antares is the one that appears slightly yellow. It is nearly 100 times the diameter of our Sun and one of the brightest objects in the night sky. You can see the color of this star with your eyes. Above that is the Rho Ophiuci Cloud Complex, named for the star system that appears to our eyes as a single bright star with a bluish tint.   They are not always this prominent, but both Saturn and Jupiter make an appearance in this image as well. The Great Rift is the name of the darker area the dissects the core of the Milky Way on the right side of the image. This is a large area of dust that essentially blocks the view of any stars behind it. This area is visible to your eyes when you are in a dark enough area. Standing under the stars in places like this is frightening both physically and mentally. Darkness conceals critters and the vastness confounds the mind. I love it though. I hope this image gives you the same sense of wonder it gives me!

"🔥Star Gazing in Montana The colors in this image are not visible to the unaided eye, but they are present in the dark sky after the sun goes down. I took this picture several years ago on a July 4th weekend in southwest Montana. I have processed this image in a way that shows off the colors in our sky just because I am in awe of unspeakable beauty that is Montana’s night sky. The Milky Way Galaxy, of which Earth is a part, has spiraling arms that extend out from its center. What you see cutting diagonally across this image is what we see as we look out through a small portion of just one of these arms. The Milky Way’s diameter is 52,850 light years across! Light travels 5.88 trillion miles in a year. I simply cannot fathom how far 5.88 multiplied by 52,850 is. In this image you can see another astronomic feature. Above the summit of Black Butte, you can see the rough silhouette of a horse. It is called the Dark Horse Nebula. Nebulae are formed of gases and dust. They can be the remains of stars that have exploded or they can be the fuels that cause a new star to form. The Dark Horse contributes to the area of the Milky Way called the Great Rift. It is quite visible in this image as the darker areas that cut through the core of the Milky Way. The year I captured this image, the planet Jupiter was visible. You can see it here just to the right of the Dark Horse. It appears as a large white point of light.  The techniques used to capture this image actually let you see stars that your eye cannot see. It is almost distracting how many stars there are! In fact, there is software I often use to reduce the size and number of stars in an image to make it more believable. This is all a bunch of scientific jargon for what could simply be described by one word in all caps….WOW!   We in Montana are blessed with some very clear air and fewer sources of what we photographers call light pollution. The orange glow you see behind the mountain here is light pollution from Idaho Falls, over 100 miles away. These domes of light are not just annoying to photographers, but actually quite disruptive to wildlife like migrating birds. Do the natural world a favor and if you have the opportunity, do what you can to limit the use of unnecessary lighting and encourage others to do the same.

"🔥 Hummingbird Chicks The nesting process for hummingbirds is both intense and incredibly fast-paced!  Incubation Time: Hummingbirds typically lay 2 eggs per clutch, and the mother (females are solely responsible for nesting duties) incubates the eggs for about 14 to 18 days, depending on species and weather conditions   Feeding and Nesting Duration: Once the chicks hatch, the mother feeds them a diet of regurgitated insects and nectar. The nestling period lasts about 18 to 28 days after hatching. During this time, the mother makes hundreds of trips per day to gather food for her rapidly growing young   By the time they leave the nest—known as fledging—the baby hummingbirds are fully feathered and almost adult-sized. However, even after leaving the nest, they often stay close by and may be fed by the mother for a few days as they learn to forage on their own.",doğasever,1kkjscr

"🔥 The lesser known cousin of the killer whale, the false killer whale. False Killer Whales: The Lesser-Known Cousins of Orcas with Surprising Similarities  False killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) are an interesting species that often get overshadowed by their famous cousins, the killer whales (Orcinus orca). Despite the name, false killer whales aren’t closely related to orcas; they just share some striking similarities that can easily confuse the casual observer.  Key Similarities:  	•	Appearance: Both species have streamlined bodies and similar dark coloration, but false killer whales are smaller, with a more slender, elongated body and a less pronounced dorsal fin. 	•	Social Structure: Like orcas, false killer whales are highly social and live in tight-knit pods. They also display strong bonds within their groups, even sharing food with one another. 	•	Hunting Behavior: While false killer whales primarily hunt fish and squid, they sometimes target larger prey like dolphins, showing a level of hunting cooperation similar to orcas.  Key Differences:  	•	Size: False killer whales are significantly smaller, averaging around 15-20 feet in length, compared to orcas, which can reach up to 32 feet. 	•	Distribution: False killer whales prefer warmer, tropical, and subtropical waters, whereas orcas are found in a wide range of climates, from the Arctic to the equator. 	•	Behavior with Humans: False killer whales are known to be more curious and less aggressive toward humans compared to some ecotypes of orcas. There have even been instances of them interacting playfully with divers.  Despite the similarities, false killer whales have a unique identity. They’re fascinating creatures in their own right and a reminder of how much diversity exists in the ocean!",doğasever,1ew8it3

"🔥 Jumping Spiders- Considered Cutest arachnids are damn fast 🔥 Jumping spiders can live up to their name. These spiders don't hunt by snaring prey in a web, but rather they stalk their quarry and then leap. Despite their tiny body size, jumping spiders can leap up to 6.3 inches (160 mm), according to a 2018 paper in the journal Scientific Reports. The spiders often spin a little silk and set a thread-like ""anchor"" before they leap, which may help stabilize their flight and protect them in case their landing is off. Jumping spiders most often jump to catch their prey, but sometimes leap to flee danger. They can also be quite clever",doğasever,1chnir4

It is widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, and is a vagrant to the southern Arabian Peninsula. It prefers open woodland and savanna, and it is for the most part absent from treeless places. Usually found alone or in pairs, it perches at the tops of trees, poles or other high vantage points from where it can spot insects, amphibians and small birds moving about on the ground.  This species is unofficially considered the national bird of Kenya. Alternative names for the lilac-breasted roller include the fork-tailed roller, lilac-throated roller (also used for a subspecies of purple roller) and Mosilikatze's roller.",doğasever,1g82slm

"🔥 Sky turns Purple in Florida due to Rayleigh and Mie scattering The sky can appear purple under certain conditions when both blue and red light are scattered together in a process called Rayleigh scattering. This can happen during sunrise or sunset when the angle of the sun is low, allowing both shorter wavelengths (blue) and longer wavelengths (red) to be scattered in the atmosphere, and sometimes when the atmosphere contains specific particles or pollutants that further influence how light is scattered.  Mie scattering affects all wavelengths more evenly, and when combined with Rayleigh scattering, it can cause a mix of blue and red light to scatter, resulting in a purple hue. The combination of these scattering processes during sunrise, sunset, or in certain atmospheric conditions, like during hurricane Milton in Florida, can create a purple sky.",doğasever,1g0n1kl

"🔥 The Norway Lemming, also known as the fiercest animal on the tundra The Norway Lemming is a species of lemming found across northern Fennoscandia. It's an interesting little creature, as it has a very unique defence mechanism.  First of all, it's fur pattern can help it blend in among the tundra rocks and plants. It is also really quick on it's feet, and can scurry in between rocks and holes in the ground.  However since the tundra is quite open, and for a rodent that relies on hiding itself, it needed to develop a last resort defence if it isn't able to reach a hiding place. It will turn around, squeal and bite at the predator, similar to honey badgers. Their bite can also hurt, as they are able to bite a chunk of the nose on dogs and foxes, which means they have to be a bit careful when dealing with these lemmings",doğasever,1farapl

"🔥 The Eurasian Lynx. This one is staying near houses hunting cats and other pets So a bit of a backstory about lynxes here. Where i live, there is a cape, and that cape is a prime spot for reindeer and sheep. My family has moved with their reindeer there for generations, and there have been sheep farmers there for quite some time. However, with all those herbivores, predators are also bound too follow.  North side of the cape is prime lynx habitat, with trees and rugged terrain. The reindeer and sheep never went there, but lynxes can be found there. However here is the catch, while the enviroment is fit for a lynx, there is no food there. This means that once the reindeer and sheep leave, the lynxes would starve to death in the winter, because there is not much else to eat there.  However these last 10 years people started feeding the lynxes through the winter, meaning they survived until summer until the herds returned. Back in the day the cape didn't have a lynx there year round. Sometimes it could go several years until a lynx came back, because there is no food there in the winter, but because they get food there now, they have settled.  This meant that the cape, which usualy only had a lynx sometimes, suddenly has several living there. The sheep farmers lost so many animals that they just gave up and moved. The reindeer stayed for a couple of years.  However this year we decided that we aren't letting the reindeer go to the cape, blocking them and moving them the other way. Now suddenly the lynxes have lost their main food source, and have too find a new food source. Migratory birds, hares and rodents are the main source now, however this lynx has started walking around the neighborhoods looking for cats and other domestic animals too eat.",doğasever,1ebzaat

There’s a quiet kind of magic I find in the mountains, valleys and the far off hidden places where signal fades but my soul speaks the loudest. I feel most at home where the path is wild, where the air is crisp and the silence is sacred.  As a South African local, I’m constantly speechless of the raw beauty this country holds. From rugged cliffs to lush forests, sunburnt trails to secret waterfalls. South Africa is a playground for the curious, the wild hearted and the seekers.

"The orange chinchillón, Bolivia, 2023 The orange chinchillón (Lagidium viscacia), also known as the southern viscacha, is a fascinating rodent species found in the rocky Andean regions of Bolivia. Resembling a mix between a rabbit and a squirrel, this fluffy mammal is easily recognized by its long ears, bushy tail, and orange-brown fur. Despite the harsh high-altitude environment, the chinchillón is highly social and lives in colonies of up to several dozen individuals. These social groups provide safety, warmth, and opportunities for play and grooming—key elements for survival in the cold Andes. They communicate through whistles, chirps, and body language, maintaining tight bonds within the colony. During the day, they can often be seen basking in the sun on rock ledges, always alert to predators. Observing chinchillones interact in their natural habitat is a true delight for wildlife enthusiasts visiting Bolivia’s breathtaking highlands.",doğasever,1knbzl9

Canon 700D review Photos taken using Exeter Colleges' Canon 700D with an 18-55mm lens.  Pros: • Crystal-clear photos. Good quality for an on-the-go camera. • Large battery + storage. Ideal if you are taking photos for several hours.  Cons: • Slightly large + heavy. May lead to instability issues. • Lots of buttons. May be complicated for first-timers.  This camera can be renter either in person at the CCI building LRC(top floor) or online to be picked up later.,doğasever,1kmh0o7

"The Galactic Core This 45 mm panorama of the Milky Way core is one of my all-time favorite images I’ve ever taken. Even though it’s hard to believe, it was captured here in Germany during my last trip to Lake Sylvenstein. It’s simply rotated 90 degrees to the left (My favorite view of the core). This Mosaic is only 3min exposure time per panel (RGB) too. It's beyond my imagination that in the Southern Hemisphere, the Milky Way can be captured in this very orientation. Our night sky is truly amazing!

"The Great Wildebeest Migration, Kenya, 2024 The Great Wildebeest Migration in Kenya is one of the most extraordinary wildlife spectacles on Earth. Each year, millions of wildebeest, joined by zebras and gazelles, traverse the vast plains of the Serengeti in Tanzania to the Masai Mara in Kenya in search of fresh grazing lands. This perilous journey, marked by dramatic river crossings at the Mara River, showcases the resilience of these animals as they face crocodile-infested waters and prowling predators. The migration is a vital ecological event, supporting the balance of life in the savannah. For wildlife enthusiasts and photographers, witnessing this awe-inspiring phenomenon is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, capturing the raw beauty and drama of nature.",doğasever,1kjwz3c

"The Golden Eagle – Master of the Skies Behold the fierce beauty of nature’s elite predator. The Golden Eagle – Master of the Skies Behold the fierce beauty of nature’s elite predator.  There’s something deeply awe-inspiring about locking eyes with a Golden Eagle. With its razor-sharp beak, piercing gaze, and a plumage that gleams like burnished bronze under the sun, this raptor isn’t just a bird — it’s a symbol of dominance, precision, and wild freedom.  What Makes the Golden Eagle So Special?  Scientific name: Aquila chrysaetos  Wingspan: Up to 2.3 meters (7.5 feet)  Top speed: Over 240 km/h (150 mph) in a dive — rivaling the peregrine falcon!  Habitat: Mountains, cliffs, and open terrains across the Northern Hemisphere  Diet: Primarily hares, rabbits, marmots, and sometimes even small deer!   Killer Instinct & Supreme Vision Golden Eagles possess telescopic vision — they can spot prey from over 3 kilometers away. Combine that with powerful talons and unmatched agility in the air, and you have a lethal hunter evolved to perfection.  A Legacy of Power and Majesty Revered by ancient warriors, adopted on national emblems, and celebrated in folklore, the Golden Eagle stands tall not just in the skies, but also in the hearts of those who admire strength and freedom.  Fun Fact: Golden Eagles form strong monogamous pairs and often return to the same nest year after year — some nests can be as large as a small car!   ---  Have you ever witnessed a Golden Eagle in the wild?

"Milkweed opening it's pods in the fall Milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) seed pods opening up in the fall to allow for seed dispersal.  The silky white threads help the seeds to be carried away by the wind and deposited away from the parent plant.   This strategy is effective since milkweed are perennial, persisting in the same location for multiple years. An annual plant, on the other hand, may have more incentive to drop seeds in the vicinity of the parent plant since it will senesce after the season and won't have to compete with the new individuals next season.",doğasever,1govlmu

"The Milky Way This is an image from last September. During this month, the Milky Way stands nearly vertically in the nightsky. This is also one of my first photos since I started my astrophotography hobby. You can tell because I forgot my star tracker and underexposed the foreground. To fix this, I took a large number of shots and stacked them together. I darkened the foreground, which in the end resulted in what I think is a very harmonious image. What do you think?

"vibrant Milky Way core above the hill 🌌✨ support me on my socials: vhastrophotography ✌🏻  Even in light-polluted Germany, it’s still possible to capture reasonably good details of the Milky Way. The variety of colors you can bring out in post-processing is always fascinating. Since I haven’t been doing photography with an astro modified camera for very long, I’m currently experimenting with my editing style.  I’m really happy with how it turned out. What do you think?

"""GrandOak"" (Lake Eufaula, OK) This is ""GrandOak."" (note: oak trees are monoecious, which means they have both male & female flowers on the same tree; hence why I didn't nickname the tree ""Grandmother Oak"" or ""Grandfather Oak""). This White Oak may not be special to anyone else but me, but it's the only one I've ever seen, in person, to live & naturally grow to have such big, long branched; most are damaged/pruned by nature &/or humans before they ever get a chance to grow this large & long-branched. My husband & I discovered this beautiful old tree growing in the woods between our house & Lake Eufaula during deer season about 6 years ago. Since then, it's become one of my favorite places to get away from the world & relax, read a book &/or take a nap during the Spring, Summer & beginning of Autumn; it's my favorite tree/deer stand during late Autumn through Winter. 🌳",doğasever,1k7m0n1

Exceptional sunset in East Greenland This one is exceptional. I experience the most stunning sunsets when I’m in Greenland. It never gets old. Sunset is my favorite time of day while in Greenland because you never know what you’re gonna get. East Greenland is best reached via Iceland as a side excursion or a standalone trip. I love it there because the vibe is very different from West Greenland. Only 5% of Greenland’s population live on the east coast so it’s more about sustenance out there.

"Waterfall in Eastern Iceland near Djúpivogur [OC] An incredible find off the beaten path in Eastern Iceland. I highly recommend it. I usually go to Iceland only to transfer to my flights to Greenland but this time I took my SO along on a cruise from there to Greenland. But this time we took extra time to visit Iceland and the drive the entire ring road in two weeks.   I found eastern Iceland absolutely stunning and next to no one was there. For folks that like Disko Island in Greenland, East Iceland is a more accessible adventure should you be interested in Greenland, visit us at r/greenlandtravel",doğasever,1gybqdj

"Reflet d'Orée Sous la voûte dorée des arbres, Le soleil joue avec l'eau calme, Éclairant d'une lueur suave, La forêt et ses doux charmes.Les feuilles dansent au vent léger, En une symphonie d'automne, Les rayons filtrent, s'engouffrant, Dans ce havre où tout résonne.Le ruisseau murmure doucement, Des secrets que le temps oublie, Le calme règne, enveloppant, Cette nature en harmonie.Les ombres se mêlent aux reflets, Sur la surface, miroirs d'or, La forêt, temple sacré, Offre son cœur à l'aurore.",doğasever,1dnnkja

"Pristine North Greenland - Qaanaaq [OC] Qaanaaq is gorgeous and the ultimate adventure in the far north of Greenland. Sometimes I don’t bother photographing the mountains and focus on ice. This time was when I evolved as a photographer and started shooting wider but also when I started visiting the remotest towns in Greenland that are surrounded by mountains. Now, I can’t live without having them in my images!  It’s only 860 miles south of the North Pole. Few people are able to visit because of the enormous expense to get there and how remote Qaanaaq is. It might take an extra week or two to reach Qaanaaq because of limited flights, weight considerations, weather, status on Air Greenland, and numerous other priorities. I was personally stranded for an extra four nights in Ilulissat en route to Qaanaaq.  Like Ittoqqortoormiit, Qaanaaq is a hunting village in polar bear country. We discuss Greenland extensively on r/greenlandtravel",doğasever,1h0ooh0

"One of The Beautiful Big Five Team Elephant at Mikumi National Park ,Tanzania .  Mikumi National Park is a national park near Morogoro, Tanzania with an area of 3,230 km2 (1,250 sq mi) that was established in 1964. It is the fourth largest in the country. The park is crossed by Tanzania's A-7 highway.  Mikumi National Park is in borders with  Selous Game Reserve on the south, the two areas forming a unique ecosystem. Two other natural areas bordering the national park are the Udzungwa Mountains and Uluguru Mountains. Malundwe Mountain is within the park, the highest of a belt of hills that run east and west through the park, connecting the Uluguru Mountains to the northeast with the Uvidunda and Udzungwa mountains to the west. Malundwe Mountain consists of three peaks along a ridge running north and south. Malundwe's south peak is the highest point in the park, reaching 1290 meters elevation.",doğasever,1kq2vyi

"Tigress hunting across Ranthambhore’s dry grasslands Photographed during one of my early photographic tours to Ranthambhore National Park, India, around twenty years ago. This tigress had spotted a sambar deer in the distance and paused to assess her approach.  The dry grasses offer limited cover at this time of year, requiring great patience and precision. It was a remarkable moment to witness — a reminder of how perfectly these animals are adapted to their environment.  I continue to lead small photographic tours to Ranthambhore today, and moments like this are as special now as they were then.",doğasever,1k90l1d

"Chapman valley This photo presents a captivating landscape that beautifully showcases the diverse terrain and rich natural colors of a rural area. The foreground features a gravel area that leads the eye toward a winding road, which snakes gracefully through lush green fields and dense patches of shrubs and small trees.  The road serves as a visual guide, drawing the viewer's eye across the varied green hues of the agricultural fields and deeper into the landscape, where it meets the distant rolling hills. The horizon is broad and open, suggesting a vast expanse of countryside under a bright, cloud-dotted sky. The vivid blue of the sky contrasts with the earthy tones of the landscape, highlighting the vibrant natural beauty of the area.  This scene could be ideal for activities such as driving, cycling, or simply enjoying a scenic overlook. It exudes a sense of tranquility and space, making it a fantastic subject for a photograph that captures the essence of expansive, serene country landscapes.",doğasever,1hg8w3b

"New to gardening, advice appreciated! (UK garden) I recently bought my first home and it’s got this beautiful landscaped back garden which I’ll be learning to look after.   Can anybody tell me what this grass is? I thought originally it was Wild Garlic but it’s odourless and it hasn’t flowered yet (late May)   I like how wild it looks, and it’s great filler for the moment while I learn the ropes - but if anyone has any ideas how to manage this as it seems invasive and is growing by the day despite being cut back twice already.   Thanks!",doğasever,1kqdrpu

Endless summer crush being dramatic So happy I’ve figured out how to get these things to perform.  The first two years they were pretty sad.  Last year and this year they are absolutely stunning. Part sun / part shade.  Lots of water.  In the early early spring as soon as the leaves start to bud on the branches do a deadhead of last years blossoms and cut off any dead wood.  Add a simple basic fertilizer only once.  And then water consistently.  They will reward you :) zone 8a,doğasever,1kpp0r1

Massive rosemary bush needs reshaping Hi all - I have an amazing rosemary bush (as pictured) that I’d like to be half the size and eventually in a neater plump standard bush shape. At the moment its left hand side is full and the right hand side is very sparse. Probably due to the fact that we hacked it back about 7 years ago at the base on one side (didn’t know what we were doing) and it’s grown one sided.  Any tips on how to start managing it ? It’s just finished flowering.  Cheers !,doğasever,1kq6l7m

"Help me save my hydrangea! I was recently gifted this hydrangea and when I received it it looked gorgeous, but I have successfully turned it into this. 😭 At first I only watered once a week, and after about two weeks I realized my mistake because it looked super wilted. Since then I’ve been watering it when the soil feels dry (usually every 2 days or so), and I have it indoors by a window. I’ve seen some improvement, but it still looks pretty rough.   I’m new to gardening so please be kind!! I have a few indoor plants that I’ve taken care of successfully, but have no experience with bushes or outdoor plants. I’ve held off planting this outside because I thought I’d have more control to nurse it back to life indoors first, and then move it out when it looked happier.   How can I help this little guy?

"Sweet William starting to bloom. One of my favorites. Three years ago, I picked up a little packet of Sweet William seeds on a whim half because the name sounded like something from a fairytale, half because it was on sale for a dollar. I scattered them along a weedy patch of fence I’d half given up on, forgot about them for a while… and then one day, boom color explosion. Now I’m in deep. These frilly, clove-scented blooms have been one of my favorite parts of the growing season ever since. What I didn’t expect was just how easy and satisfying they’d be. Sweet William (Dianthus barbatus) is technically a biennial, but in my garden? They bloom whenever they feel like it. The first year I got mostly leaves, sure but since then, it’s been a steady cycle of blooming, fading, and reseeding. I don’t even have to try anymore. They just show up. And the seeds oh man. If you’re into seed-saving, Sweet William is a goldmine. Once the blooms dry up, I pinch the seed heads and end up with little treasure piles to tuck into random corners or trade with friends. They’re like the plant that keeps on giving. I grow them along the edge of my veggie beds, around the compost pile (which they totally class up), and in a few pots where they mix with alyssum and chamomile. They’re pollinator magnets, smell amazing, and even the deer in my area usually pass them up. If you’ve got a bit of sun, a few bucks, and some patience this one’s worth it. It’s the kind of flower that makes your garden feel like a place someone would write a poem about. Anyone else growing Sweet William this year? Do yours come back every season like mine? And do you collect seeds too, or let them go wild?",doğasever,1kpmh6i

"Need advice on old growth lilac Hi there! New to this sub and new to gardening. I inherited this old growth lilac tree with my home purchase. It has lichen all over and lots of dead twigs. My house is 112 years old, so likely this tree is very old and it’s been decades since its last prune (last homeowners were neglectful).   I’ve recently learned that these old growth lilacs “grow at the tip,” which mine absolutely does to an extreme. There are just a bunch of super long branches that grow really tall and wide. Then all the lilacs are on tiny green sprigs at the tippy end of these lichen-covered branches.  Here is a photo of it from a couple weeks ago during bloom vs today with the flowers starting to brown. So I know it’s time to get pruning!! I want to make this tree as BODACIOUS with lilacs as possible.   So I spent the entire weekend researching and the internet and ChatGPT tell me to start by removing the dead twigs and “deadheading” the blooms. I spent the weekend doing that but I feel like…there is something more optimal I should be doing. Like cutting the big branches down to the stub??

We got rid of all of it about 3 years ago and have successfully grown wildflowers in the garden beds. We filled the garden beds with composted leaves and tilled it in two years in a row which I think helped with the soil quality.

"Help please! New homeowner, lots of plants. Situation- first time homeowner, bought a house with a lot of landscaping this past fall. Previous homeowners occasionally used a landscaping company, but also neglected a lot recently according to neighbors. I’m getting married soon so I have like $500 max to invest this season, but will have more come next spring. US North Central zone 6a with cold winters, and my yard also has drainage issues so idk if that plays a part but just mentioning it. I know NOTHING about plants so I’ve been using a mobile app to identify stuff in my yard and take care of it.   My goal is to have a healthy, clean-looking landscape, that requires as little ongoing maintenance as possible.   Pictures are numbered so here’s the info on each, identified by the app I use:   1.) Common Burdock- it seems like this space in my garden was dedicated to it, or it took something else over? Should I cut it down and try to remove the roots, or keep it? And if I keep it- should I just trim it down to keep from spreading further? And there’s some Goutweed in the background running along the fence and spreading…guessing I should remove that entirely?  2.) Ostritch fern- our AC unit was smaller before we replaced it so I’m guessing these are here on purpose, but maybe I should just prune them so they’re not touching the AC? Or remove entirely?  3.) Red osier dogwood (and surrounding area)- this is the town utility box access so I’m thinking I need to try removing everything surrounding those boxes? The tree on the right also sprouted up REAL QUICK…feels like it was half this size 6 months ago.   4.)

I'm new to gardening but I have the space and I definitely have time so I'm looking for any kind of advice to help me with my first garden bed. Really just hoping to get better at gardening and be a little bit more self-sufficient. What I've got done so far is I've cleared a 28ft x 20 ft.area. The soil here is from former farmer fields from what I assume the '60/70's. Has now been zoned for residential and with my lots in particular border an easement of 20 meters of surrounding area trees.  I've torn out all the weeds and they're associated root systems. The soil is clear of any large rocks or wood contaminants. I'm located in Southern Ontario and the garden has an open and unobstructed view of the Sun facing southeast.  On this space, I'm also planning on constructing a hoop structure greenhouse to shelter the plants. Most plants this year will be different varieties of tomato, some zucchini, a sunflower and carrots  The greenhouse dimensions are 26 ft by 10 ft Looking for advice really on the soil and what to add to it next? After that I need help setting up The individual beds within the greenhouse and how I should be spacing them.  I really feel like this first year should just be about setting up the footprint and getting everything kind of ready to cultivate better plants next year.",doğasever,1kqd291

I haven’t fertilized anything yet. I thought the compost would hold them over for a while but maybe that would help?   ALSO- I used wool as mulch around the roots. It’s an amazing mulch, y’all should look into it, and I think once it stops raining my plants will be so thankful for it but right now it’s holding extra water and has me worried",doğasever,1kpw4s5

"I feel like a failure Last year I did pretty well with my plants, but this year nothing worked out for me.   My 2 tomato plants grew great and had lots of flowers, none of which got pollinated and as a result I have zero tomatoes for this year.   I planted flowers from seed for the first time and waited months for them to grow, only to have them shrivel up and die because my husband didn’t water them daily like I told him they needed.   My pepper plant also flowered and didn’t get pollinated so no peppers.   All the flowers I bought at the grocery store already bloomed and potted also shriveled up and died I’m assuming because of my husband’s lack of watering as well.   My cucumber plant produced dozens of flowers, none of which were pollinated so no cucumbers either.   My mint and blueberry plant that were doing great has browned and died as well.   The only plant that has anything currently is the sugar baby watermelon that had 5 growing and the small ones shriveled up and now only has one. My arugula plant was able to be harvested twice as well so I guess that’s kind of a success.   I just feel so disappointed because I put in so much work into all these plants, all for them to just die or produce nothing. I’m so discouraged and don’t want to try again next year at all, which makes me even more upset because gardening brought me so much joy working with my hands and watching everything grow.   I live in Texas and even though it’s not summer yet the temperature is already past 100 degrees and I feel as though it’s too hot for anything to grow and I have no chance until next spring. To top it off my husband mowed down the only pretty part of our yard this lovely clover patch that was the last remaining source of joy in my backyard.   I just needed to rant and any advice is appreciated, I don’t know where I went wrong why nothing got pollinated this year when last year all of my plants produced and I had even more flowers this year than last. Maybe it’s the position of the bird feeders? I do feed the birds in my yard but the plans are quite far from the feeders, maybe not far enough…maybe it’s the wasps scaring the bees off, I have no idea. My gardening dreams are just crushed and with this being my third year doing this I just feel like I should have been able to do better.",doğasever,1kpv1uo

"Bug / Gnat infestation in herb garden Hello all! New Nashville gardener here, I recently set up my first raised garden bed on my interior-facing apartment balcony. I used an organic raised garden bed soil from Home Depot and purchased herbs from a local garden center.   Everything was going great the first few weeks, but what started off as a small handful of bugs flying around (possibly fungus gnats from my research?) has quickly turned into an infestation. I set up sticky traps and have caught at least a thousand in just the last week. I also have been using neem oil on them since the beginning, tried sprinkling cinnamon, and started using Captain Jack’s Deadbug spray a few days ago but nothing helps.  I have other plants outside and they never had issues so I was thinking it may have been the soil I used in the raised beds. Since I have tried other options, I’m thinking the next step may be to replace all of the dirt in the bed. There are no visible signs of fungus in the soil but we have had plenty of rain recently.   Curious if anyone has experienced a similar issue and I appreciate any advice you can provide this gardening newbie to help rid these pests! Thank you!",doğasever,1kpqjj8

How much to prune Easter lily to promote rebloom I was gifted this Easter lily in a pot in early April and it was in full bloom. Most of the flowers fell off within a week (which I understand is normal). I deadheaded the flowers and planted it and some of the leaves have turned yellow/brownish and have these white spots (transplant shock or sunburn? We had a few days in the 90s right after). However it does have some new growth at the base (3rd pic). I’ve read you can prune them to encourage new bloom possibly in the same year but I’m not sure how much to cut off. Some sources said to cut it down to the ground level and others said to just remove the damaged leaves and keep the healthy ones. Do I cut the leaves at the stem or just the brown part? Or should I just let it be? I would love to have a second bloom this year if possible.,doğasever,1kpqb2c

I'm a newbie and I basically just use a wooden stick to loosen the dirt sometimes, and I dilute a 10-10-10 fertilizer on water once a month to keep em healthy.  When I replant my plants, do I need to fully replace the soil? I really don't want to mess with the roots too much.  Can I just fill the bigger vase with new soil, and keep fertilizing like I always did? Or will old soil get poor regardless?  Also, do I need to put stones/clay/sand?

"Saving bulbs from overgrown garden Hi all! I inherited my grandmother’s house recently. She was an extremely talented gardener, but her garden fell into disrepair in the last few years of her life. Some of my favorite moments of spring were seeing the crocuses poking up, followed by the daffodils and tulips (and some others whose names I regrettably don’t know). These flowers have been there for decades, but I don’t know what upkeep my grandmother did to keep them lively. They’re really struggling in the bed, and I want to save what I can of the garden.  The garden bed has so many tall weeds covering shorter weeds. It looks like a pile of hay for lack of a better descriptor. There’s also what appears to be a black walnut that has taken up residence in the last year or two, and I’d like to get it out of there for good.  I’ve seen that you can cover beds with cardboard or newspaper, then mulch, but I worry that the bulbs will have no way to get back through next spring. Is digging up the bed and trying to replant the bulbs the best way to go? Is there another method I’m missing? Any advice or thoughts would be very much appreciated!",doğasever,1kq0sst

"Raised beds and dog poop. I recently began growing a whole slew of vegetable and fruit plants. Currently they're in pots, away from the area I was given access to/designated for my garden. (And hopefully where they are currently is not where the dog poop has been? Kind of a rocky/stoned area). The problem: two dogs have regularly been using this newly designated area as their favorite poop spot for years.  I was told I could place a raised bed there if I can get it to fit in this area. I have many tomato plants, lettuce, radishes, beets, peas- you name it. (And I'm realizing the peas and beets MAY currently be in an area dogs have pooped-away from the rest of the plants-but they're in containers, is this okay?)  The question(s):  If I decided to use concrete pavers for cost efficiency, can I use them as the base and sides of the bed? Is this good for drainage?   Would the pavers be enough separation from the soil the poop was on before, or should I put that garden tarp stuff down beneath it?  Should I do the tarp, then pavers, and pebbles- to prevent contact with contaminated soil and to ensure drainage?  Are my pea plants okay in a large pot on top of soil that may have been contaminated?

"Send me all the tips please! I really want to garden this year, I have 3 plans in mind.  1. Flowers at the front in two spots (a flower bed and around the base of a tree) 2. A herb garden in a smallish planter  3. A small veggie garden   I just moved into a house that wasn't well taken care of outside. There are huge weeds growing in the flower bed at the front. Im trying to get all the weeds out but should I remove all the soil and start fresh or just add new soil on top? The old soil isn't too deep so I'd need to add more anyway to add height. Should I put the soil on top or mix it together or start fresh? Also there are small rocks at the bottom layer that are a bit mixed in with the bottom layer of soil.   My next question is the same for the back where there is a small bed for a veggie garden. It also has old, weedy soil but no rocks at the bottom. Do I start fresh, mix or add on top? Also should I be buying worms from somewhere to help with flowers and/or garden? Or do they just show up? Lol   There is a medium/small tree out front which has a stone circle around it and I think it would be so nice to add flowers inside that around the base. It's a skinny tree. I would have to remove the grass that's growing around the base and then add soil and plant the flowers. Is there anything important to know/do with this since I have to remove the grass?

It also rained on them for idk how long today when I was at work (worked from 8am-4pm, rain already stopped when I got out) The soil basically had no time to drain any water 😭    I moderately watered all of my potted Albion strawberry roots yesterday afternoon before work. When I was on break during work, I checked the weather, and saw there was a small chance of rain later that night. So, I texted my dad, asking if he could put them on top of the storage box under the roof. I specified that they were under the table AND underneath the chairs on the backyard deck (it was super hot and sunny so I put them under there for some shade. Also, the chairs have small holes, so water can get through them). He sent a thumbs up emoji, so I assumed he understood and did what I asked.   Later that night, I get home from work, and asked my dad again if he moved my strawberry roots. He told me to check, and he wasn't being clear about it, so I was confused and worried. I was too tired to go outside, so I just prayed he out them under the roof (it rained last night, so if he didn't move them, it would've been too late anyway).   This morning, I didn't have time to check on my plants, so I decided to check on them in the afternoon. It also happened to rain when I was at work. When I got home, I immediately looked at the storage box to only see 1 tray on there, so I started to freak out and checked underneath the chairs (I have 3 trays). I see the 2 other trays under the chairs, and the soil is all soaking wet.   I've only had these strawberry roots for a couple of days, and they've grown so quickly. The soil has been moderately wet since yesterday in the afternoon, and presumably has been soaking wet since last night up till now. Are my roots cooked? 😭",doğasever,1kpvvui

However, I’m wondering if there would be any nice ideas to use the stump or trunk of the tree as a feature.   We could cut the stump down to a couple of feet and use it as a table. I was also thinking if I left the trunk about 10-15ft high and try to do something with it.  Any ideas would be appreciated!!",doğasever,1kppw00

We have an odd twice a year season. I had always thought that tomatoes are annual but because it only gets into the low 40’s in winter that is actually the early stage of the growth season. I get tomatoes in March and July considering I shade the plant in the summer months.  Each year I just cut back the dying branches and new ones come back. This will be the 4th or 5th harvest of this same plant. I’m also posting a picture of the harvest in March.

"How to deal with judgy neighbours? I recently fell in love with gardening and I now spend as much time as I can out there. It has been great for my physical & mental health. Unfortunately I have been dealing with snarky comments while I’m working from my neighbours eg: -“Out again in the garden??” -“Working on the grass again?” -“What are you up to ‘now’?” -“Wow, there can’t be an inch you haven’t touched on that property” -“Always gardening eh..?”  No other topics of conversation, just how much I garden. I’m not doing anything noisy or annoying, just the usual: planting, weeding, pruning, etc. Occasionally if I’ve been working all day I will do a few hours in the evening but that’s only when the days are longer. Although that can be until about 8 or 9pm I can usually hear kids still playing outside. (A recent comment was “Always in the evening…”) How would you mentally deal with this? I’ve started to notice myself hesitating to go outside sometimes. I think “I don’t want to have to deal with comments or the feeling of being watched”. So far I have managed to push past it. For context I sometimes struggle with social anxiety so this is why this bothers me perhaps more so than it would  someone else.  *Thank you for all the replies. I will try to keep an open mind and certainly to keep gardening! Lol.  *Some extra info:  -They never start the conversation with a “Hi” or “How are you today” which is how I would greet an immediate neighbour I wanted to befriend as suggested by some. I understand the casual passerby people who make friendly, complimentary comments without saying hello, so I understand the type of communication commenters are referring to?  -I have tried to steer the conversation to questions that help me get to know them but I don’t get a whole lot back and the next time I see them it’s straight in to the garden comments that have a tone to them.  -One area of the garden is next to a pedestrian path and other people/passer-by’s often stop and comment to say how they like what I’m planting or how well something is growing etc. I really enjoy those interactions and they’ve have helped my anxiety more than they’ll ever know.  - Their garden was indeed a mess but they’ve recently started to try and improve it. The difference between mine and theirs is huge.  - I have previously baked for them, offered to mow their lawn when their not home, and gave them some vegetables from my garden. But still day to day  is stunted on this subject and as I said I do try to ask questions about themselves, their day, their hobbies but the responses are quite dry. I wouldn’t mind if we weren’t socially compatible. It’s these direct comments with a tone that bother me.",doğasever,1kow8u1

"Self appreciation - garlic helped save me Grew up in a life of hell which led to trying to abort a few times. I was actually ready to go and something inside of me said, plant garlic. If the garlic survives - you survive. If the garlic fails, it’s time to finally let my brain sleep. I planted 1 bulb. And sure shit enough, it survived 9 months later. I did it. That then opened up a beautiful world of gardening along with a spiritual awakening. Now - I look forward to waking up each day to see what this world offers me.   1 started with 1 bulb.. now - I have 35 heads growing, plus beans/cucumbers/tomato/zuchini/cilanto/onions/dill/wildflowers etc.   We can overcome our brain battles. There are more beautiful days ahead of it. We do matter. Just wanted to share a sliver of my story as I know there are many out there. But my story, garlic gave me a reason to live.

"Proud of my little shade garden. What else should I add? This little strip along the front wall to my house gets almost 100% shade, so it has been several years of trial and error finding plants that will thrive here. Finally this year I feel like it’s all coming together! So I just wanted to show off this little patch and ask - what ideas do you have that could make it even more interesting? It would be nice to have some taller plants for vertical interest, but it seems hard to find true shade plants that aren’t close to the ground. Any ideas? I’ve even considered adding statues or fountains, also.   I’m in Zone 7b. We are in what’s considered to be the “high desert,” so humidity is almost non-existent, summers get really hot, and winters do get regular snow and cold temps.

I know some people say to toss it and start fresh every time, but that seems wasteful to me (and expensive). I usually fluff it up, mix in a little compost or fresh soil, and keep going.

"New Pollinator Garden w/ Raised Beds My wife and I finally decided to do something with this gigantic mulch bed in our back yard, converting it into a pollinator garden with some raised beds.   Previously there were 4 big holly bushes in this bed, and that was it. I hate Holly’s.   So I dug the Holly’s out and assembled the beds one weekend, and the next filled them with 2 yards of dirt, planted everything, and moved 1 ton of limestone chips to make the pathway the following weekend.   We have tomatoes and strawberries in the beds along with marigolds and lemon balm to try to deter the deer (we’ll see how this goes). For the pollinator garden we have Scotch Broom, Salvia, Cat Mint, Cone Flowers, Black Eyed Susan’s, Lupine, and Milkweed.   We’ve also got some Jantar Arborvitae along to back edge of the bed that will provide a bit of a natural privacy fence as they grow.

I live in Canada, in a condo, and right now they’re sitting on my northeast-facing balcony. I’m not sure if that gives them enough sunlight, or if I need to move them around during the day. I also don’t know how much to water them, what kind of soil they like, or if I need to re-pot them.

"I think the greenhouse worker hates me, need an expert gardeners opinion on whether he's trying to sabotage me or not ... So I love my local greenhouse but there's one older worker there who I swear hates me for no apparent reason. Maybe he hates everyone actually but still... I think he's trying to sabatoge my garden now.  For those curious about our brief interactions...I've barely ever interacted with this worker but twice previously he's made slight jabs at my choice of flowers as he's walked on by and we have absolutely never met before. I just moved here a few months ago.  ""Oh you're going with those? Well okay then."" As he's walking by and just walks away quickly. Weird I thought the first time. Maybe my choice in Lilacs wasn't good. Maybe they were more for an experienced gardener? I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt.  The second time it got a bit worst with...  ""Oh those roses? I guess SOMEONE has to like them. Pfft."" The pfft sound at the end surprised me.   Like what the hell? The second time I tried to say something but he scurried away faster than I could chase him down.   The third time I actively watched for him. I was feeling petty and this time I was gonna yell at him loudly if he insulted my choice in plants. He could outrun me but he couldn't outrun my voice. And it was busy!   No... I never pictured myself going to a greenhouse to pick a fight and I wouldn't go back but this is the biggest greenhouse in the area and they happen to have everything I want everytime I go for cheaper than other places.   Anyways... Today I went to the greenhouse and bought a Lapin cherry tree. My entire visit I was on gaurd. To my delight he was no where to be seen until we got to the tree check out. It looks like they put him into the corner far away from most people.  Anyhow to my surprise he said Lapin cherries were a good choice. I smiled. Oh okay. I appreciated the polite exchange.  Then the odd care advice came...  Bury the Lapin cherry at least a foot deeper than the container it's in..definitely cover up the notch at the bottom at the very least...  This seemed odd to me because I always thought you didn't bury fruit trees deeply because the roots needed to breathe... We do get cold winters... Is that a trick to protect the tree and make it hardier?  Help! I don't know how to plant my tree now. :/     ****Edit: Thank you everyone. It seems we have a saboteur among us. Most agree you don't plant a fruit tree deeply or it causes trunk rot and smothered roots. I went to my local Facebook gardeners page and someone mentioned the sketchy greenhouse worker too! So It's not just me. This guy obviously is just iunno maybe angry and bitter at life? I almost want to go complain but I don't know if I even want to bother. Also this has been the weirdest encounter with a random person ever. And I was mugged once. By at least I understood that situation and motive.

"Death by Zuccchini: Curcurbitacin toxicity Well today I harvested my largest yet zucchini! I was so proud!  I sliced it into spears and roasted it up with some salt, garlic powder and onion powder. It was quite good. Nice texture. Nice mild flavor. All win.  Until I started to suddenly sweat profusely. Granted the temperature in the room was 87 but I had been quite comfortable until I ate.  Of course this sent me running for google to find out if I had somehow managed to poison myself with my home grown produce. Lo and behold, I found out something new - if your zucchini tastes bitter, it's possibly because of curcurbitacin, a toxic compound that can be found in squash and cucumbers.  [This article explained more than I wanted to know.](  [And this article details the unfortunate demise of an elderly gentlemen due to curcurbitacin poisoning.](  I should say that I think I'm fine. I paced the floor and drank some water and turned on a fan and calmed down. Also, my zucchini wasn't bitter, so I don't think there was a risk due to that toxin anyway.

"“The Morning Glory Mistake: When Beauty Turns to Battle” Morning glories are easily the most invasive plant I’ve ever grown. Over the years, I’ve been given plants and warned they might take over, but they were always manageable. Morning glories, though, are a different story. I planted them last year, and now they’ve completely taken over. Despite their beautiful blooms, many species especially Ipomoea purpurea and Ipomoea indica are aggressive spreaders. They reseed prolifically, with each plant capable of producing hundreds of seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years. On top of that, they grow at an astonishing rate up to 12 inches in a single day under ideal conditions. I’ll pull them in the morning, only to return at lunch and find ten more, already six inches long and climbing. This year, I’ve planted something else in that spot, but the battle isn’t over. I’m starting to wonder if I’ll ever truly get rid of them.",doğasever,1kn8vao

"2025 Garden Underway Last year, I put in a raised bed that did pretty well.

"I have a yard now and I both love and hate it I’m a very newbie gardener who just moved into our first home with a yard last year.   Initially I didn’t really do anything in the yard because we were so focused on just getting all the basic furniture for our rooms.   But this spring the gardening bug has bit me and I started planting things in our yard. It started with just some annual potted flowers and a little azalea shrub but then I kept going back to the nursery to get more! I now have a rose, several perennial flowers, more annuals, and a little herb garden on my windowsill. And I bought a packet of zinnia seeds.    I thought I’d be happy just starting “small” with my garden - and so far working on it has brought me a lot of joy - but my head keeps spinning about all the potential ways to keep improving - adding more plants (maybe a maple tree), hanging more flower baskets, installing a paved patio area and paved path, having some kind of mini water feature (fountain/bird bath), a mini Japanese zen garden, a swinging bench and pergola, growing cut flowers so I can have fresh bouquets, climbing roses on trellises and an espalier camellia tree to cover the fencing…   I’m feeling frustrated now because everything is so expensive and takes years of work to cultivate, and I don’t have a lot of time or patience to dedicate to gardening. I work a full time job, go to school part time, and I also enjoy traveling too much! While I love looking at pretty flowers, I just don’t think my dream garden is realistically achievable. A simple large outdoor container pot can cost $100, which is enough to make me give up on the dream. I’m also really squeamish around bugs - I had to get some aphids off my rose buds and it sucked.   Anyway, just needed to vent. Life was simpler when I didn’t have a yard. Now I can’t stop thinking about it/what it could be 😅",doğasever,1knky3t

Garden vampires that suck the life out of aphids and other pests in my garden that are unlucky enough to cross their path.  However, I recently noticed that each assassin seemed to stake out a specific plant and just... stay there. So I got an idea.

Aphids on my basil?   Not anymore. Mowed down and sucked dry like sugary Capri Suns, seemingly overnight.  Leaf-munching beetles?   Not anymore.

She chose big leafy bling and sometimes getting away from what you’re used to, having another’s creative mind lead you astray, works.   I love it❣️  -PNW backyard",doğasever,1km7p8x

After searching multiple times of the years I believe I have a name, although it has gone by many and is a pre-1560 rose (apparently that means something) the rosa foetida bicolor. What was really throwing me off is that it will throw straight orange and yellow roses on the same plant. From what I read is that comes from older growth losing the bicoloring.

I think I over-indexed on the roemer’s fescue and it’s now shading out some of the shorter, native spring ephemerals, so in the fall I’ll be editing out some of the fescue in a few places and replacing it with shorter native sedges that will allow more room for the shooting stars, seablush, western buttercup, and field chickweed that’s typical of the Garry oak meadows near me.

I don't want to piss off my neighbors, but we aren't getting nearly enough pollinators in our garden even with other flowers planted for them.    Edit for correction of month.

"Will my dwarf blueberry Berrybux Brazelberry ever recover? I live in zone 7a. I bought it last year in June; it was full of leaves and even had two flowers. Over the winter, its leaves turned red and eventually fell off. The branches are green, and a few leaves have appeared over the past week. But it still seems stagnant. Next to the newly emerged leaves, it produced a flower which then fell off. The rest of the plant doesn’t seem to be greening up. At night, the minimum temperature is around 6–7°C (43–45°F), in case that’s relevant. My question is: will it recover? Do you have experience with this plant? Will it bloom and bear fruit again if its season has passed? Is this behavior normal?",doğasever,1ko69tk

Garden progress Hi!  This is my first post in here. I’m having a blast with my garden. This is my third season ever growing a garden so I am very much a novice and learning as I go. Please don’t mind the weeds between the stones - they’ll be gone soon enough :)  Garden update: - All veggies growing nicely - I have a few peppers forming and one early one that could probably be harvested soon - I’m a bit surprised at how quickly my pepper plants have grown tall. I’m assuming it is because I bought them from the store rather than planting from seed. I have previously purchased heirloom seeds and I’m guessing the store-bought plants aren’t heirloom. This is making me understand why people suggest to top your peppers so they develop stronger main stems. I never had problems with my seedling peppers but these store-bought ones are struggling to stay upright in the wind. - did some weeding and mulching today until I got too hot. Taking a coffee break now - ordered some Irish moss seeds. Going to plant Irish moss in between the stones. It will need to be started inside and transplanted outside - the zucchini plants aren’t growing the way I anticipated. Looks like I will have to do some vigorous pruning and training to get them to go up the trellis. It might not work though. I just did some research and apparently there are zucchini varieties that are vining and varieties that are bushing. I’m starting to think I have the bushing type…,doğasever,1kotbgq

"Advice for plants to consider Advice on plants to consider  Hi everyone!   Sorry for the silly picture, but I figured it might help my explanation and questions!   We have a small urban garden (5m x 6m)  which is currently just grass and white walls which my wife would very much like to bring some more green and color into. Since we don’t want to sacrifice too much surface area, we need to work mostly with climbing wall plants (ideally flowering or fruit plants).  Info about the garden and my lunatic drawing:  - The diamond shapes on the walls would be where I am I thinking of putting a stainless steel cable trellis with tensioners. - The back wall (red diamonds) is facing east, the right side of it gets a lot of sun, the left park is mostly in shade - The left wall (yellow diamonds) facing north so is in the shade all day, - The right wall (pink diamonds) is facing south so gets lots of sun. - the green thing is where I would like to plant a small tree or shrub (mostly to hopefully train my dogs to do their business there instead of all over the lawn…) - the coloured balls are where I might consider planting flowers (not sure about this one yet).  I would love any advice on which climbing plants, shrub or flowers to consider in these conditions. The climate is north west European, so pretty mild with a fair bit of rain.   Based on some research and chatGTP questions for the climbing plants they recommend as options for shaded areas climbing hydrangeas and flowering clematis (alpini or Montana wilsonii). For the sunny areas I’m seeing climbing roses, clematis jackmanii or common honeysuckle. Would you recommend these or anything else?  As you can see I’m a total gardening novice and absolutely clueless, so any advice or insights would be very appreciated! Thanks!",doğasever,1kosdoc

"Tiny back yard garden solution? Ask the neighbors! This is my first reddit post.  I live in a urban area in central NJ (the Garden State!) and my small backyard is mostly taken up by the garage. Have been growing my cacti under makeshift rain shelters as well as vegtables back there but it doesn't get a lot of full sun due to the garage and fences blocking much of it.  However my next door neighbor doesn't have a garage and doesn't really use their backyard much- so this year I asked if I could put some plants back there. They were fine with it.  I put Sioux tomatoes against the back fence, double rows of Ozark Giant, Cubanelle, Red Cheese, and Poblano peppers.  Some basil and Parris Island and Black Seeded Simpson lettuce between the rows and up front. And some Rutgers tomatoes in the back which won't get a lot of light due to a sun blocking holly tree, but we'll see how they do.  The photos show where we are at as of May 5th.

Everyone I talk to says they don't do the germinating part themselves. I am a noob here. Are they right? Is it too late?",doğasever,1kn0qkx

"Accidental tomato garden Inspired by [this post]( I thought I'd share my accidental tomatoes from Melbourne, Australia. The earth in my front yard garden where I grow flowers had sunk a lot, so I threw all my old potting mix I'd grown tomatoes in last year onto it to help raise the soil level before planting various flowers (including petunias, snapdragons, violas and cosmos). The flowers grew happily for a month or so, and then I noticed there were multiple tomato seedlings popping up as well. I thought about removing them but then thought I'd leave them to it and see what they did, figuring they'd grow a bit and then wither and die.  But no, what actually happened was they completely took over and turned my flower garden into a tomato garden. I hadn't bothered staking them or anything as I was lazy, so they all fell over and grew crooked and twisted, but this didn't seem to worry them, since they stayed healthy and green and before long were covered in fruit. On a side note, though I grow a variety of tomato types (such as yellow pear, sungold, pink tiger, Thai pink egg, green zebra and black cherry), every single front garden tomato plant turned out to be a Thai pink egg, so maybe those are particularly resilient.  The most infuriating part of this was that while these tomatoes thrived in my flower garden that I was frequently neglectful in watering, the tomatoes I lovingly tended from seed and planted in premium potting mix in my back yard garden were, while healthy, were nowhere near as productive as these tomatoes; I got more from the front yard garden tomato plants in one day than I got from my back yard garden tomatoes in a week. It got to the point where my Dad would just about cry when I came in with another armload of tomatoes because he was sick of eating them every lunch and dinner to help use them up haha  The first photo showing the garden was from a couple of months ago, the area looks a bit sad and brown now that we're getting into the colder weather, but even though the tomato plants are dying off, I'm still getting tomatoes off them, even though my back yard tomatoes stopped producing more than a month ago.

"Garden/patio area at a student apartment Hey everyone! It's my first time postning in this sub so I don't really know if it's the right place. But like the title suggests me and my partner live in a student apartment that's on the ground floor and comes with  a little outdoors patio/garden area.   The first summer there it just turned into a jungle. The weeds grew through inbetween the stone slabs and everything was at least 1m tall. Then in like September that year the housing complex sent some garden workers to all the patios and they cut basically everything down with a grass trimmer. Made my life easier but it was also a bit sad because they took down some bushes that were acting like a fence/border and now people walking by could see in a bit more.   The second summer (last year) I tried getting rid of the weeds with an anti-weed spray but I didn't really succeed. Later that summer my partner lifted all the stone plates, cleaned up under them and placed a ground cloth (? unsure if it's called that in English) underneath before putting back the stones. This was the back story, now to my question that is about the garden-ish area that surrounds the patio.   I have been pulling out the weeds on the sides and by the border of the patio to make it look more clean but I would like to do something more. Some previous tentants have planted a rhubarb in the corner which is also pretty cool and low maintenance. We appreciate the mystery bushes since they give some more privacy and a nice green feeling despite their thorns. I've been considering planting some wild flowers or berries but don't really know where to start since I don't have any experience. I also don't want to spend too much money and effort on this since we can only live here until I graduate. I have also heard rumours that the houses in this neighbourhood might soon be demolished all together because they're so old and some have already been evacuated because of structural problems. So it feels a bit sad to put in any money and effort, only for all of it to be destroyed after we move out (the likelihood of this happening soon is low but still there).  All advice is welcome.    First picture is what it looked like before the first summer (I couldn't find any pictures of the actual jungle that it was). Second picture when it was all chopped down. And last two is what it looks like now. The right side was just nettles which I pulled out. And there's a little rose hip (? unsure) plant left there behind the grill.",doğasever,1klt28x

However, the homestead I was in received their plants late at the beginning of the dry season, so, planting them in the mountains at this time means they will die. So, we decided to build nurseries for them to get them through the dry season and then reforesting the mountains.

"Solving My Pill Bug Problem Through Aggressive Hospitality I created a trap to curb the overly amorous pill bug population explosion happening in my garden beds. The goal was simple: design a luxurious, enticing hiding spot that's irresistible to pill bugs—like a dark, cozy Airbnb they’d rate five stars, but conveniently can’t leave once checked in. Surprisingly, I've found bait doesn't make a huge difference. Bait or no bait, they show up anyway.  Accommodating placement, however, is the real game-changer. I've achieved top-tier pill bug hospitality ratings by positioning traps along garden bed edges and corners, basically anywhere cool, damp, and mildly creepy. If unsure, just stalk—I mean observe—the roly-poly population to discover where ""it's happenin'."" They'll lead you straight to prime real estate. The trap lid sits low, creating exactly the kind of mysterious, hole-in-the-wall vibe pill bugs rave about.  The trap consists of four thoughtfully designed components: the housing, the trap body, the trap lid, and an optional housing cap. The housing is meant to be buried flush with your garden soil and includes a drainage hole to avoid unintended puddles. The trap body slides conveniently in and out, sparing you from repeated excavation missions, and features a discrete drainage slot to keep roly-poly guests comfortably dry. Lastly, there's an optional cap that's handy for keeping dirt and debris out while installing or when the trap itself decides to take a day off.",doğasever,1k4b3ob

They would grow beautiful fans every year but no blooms. On a whim earlier this year I decided to split them up because I saw that overcrowding could cause this. I didn’t even know they had rhizomes instead of bulbs. The ones in the bigger pot finally bloomed last night! The others haven’t yet but that’s okay, I know what I’m going to do later this year. I’m going to plant some around my mailbox as it’s the sunniest part of my yard. Maybe I’ll plant some around a tree as well to see how they do. Or along my fence line.

Sad about my community garden plot Over the weekend I spent most of my Saturday cleaning up my 10 by 10 community garden plot that has been mine for the past 2 years. My schedule has gotten busier this year so I was really excited to work with the perennials popping back up from the many gardeners before me as well as plants that started sprouting from whatever I had planted last year.   I walked by my garden this afternoon on my way home from work and it was entirely gutted. Think sterile like a hospital operating room. The plot was completely bare and my raspberry bush had been pruned down and transplanted to the back corner and a lot of my stuff was thrown out.   I was DEVASTATED. Turns out it was a clerical error and the folks that run the garden gave my plot to new gardeners. They revamped the entire plot labeling / assignments and mixed up my plot with someone else’s.   I think it’s going to be resolved (replacing lost plants and seeds I had just sewn this weekend) but I’m just so sad cause I can’t get any of those plants back that have been there for many years before I even started gardening there.

I can’t remember how I made the connection but definitely be cautious around Japanese yews. One of the most poisonous ornamental plants in the world apparently.

So far I’ve successfully propagated thyme, oregano, and basil with it.

So the bed now looks like you see on the image.  Now to the fuck up. We did not do our due diligence and properly look into what was growing in the soil.  The garden bed is filled with (now very small cuttings) of couch grass....  We are at a loss at what to do. We are considering remove all the plants again, and painstakingly picking through the bed by hand over the next month or two to remove all the grass. And on top of that add a 20cm deep border around the bed to prevent new roots to creep in.  Any and all advice is appreciated. We are a bit bummed out after all the work we out in. And then we end up doing it the worst thing possible 🫠  Not, we are planning on setting up a greenhouse at the end where there is still tarp on the ground.",doğasever,1k9pzdz

"Would this work in a home garden? I am wondering if this would work/make sense in a home garden. A short walkway with the sides and mabey ""sealing"" covered with plants (so that as little of the outside could be seen). It doesn't  need to be longer than the first image just mabey has one curve so that you can't see the end from the beginning. And that it leads to a small sitting area in a circle that would be covered similarly to the tunnel. The tunnel walls would be either climbing/vining plants that go all the way to the top, or ~7-8 feet tall branched out trees packed closely together. The ""sealing"" could be lit by some solar lights for walking at night. When I have a house and garden I would like some vegetables, herbs, fruit trees, flowers, ... and though that a ""secret"" tunnel to a small sitting area would be really cool but can't find a lot of inspiration online. Does anyone have any images/videos/creators where something similar exists?",doğasever,1k6kzox

"I actually grew tumeric! I live in Melbourne (Australia) and it's completely the wrong climate for tumeric, but I use it for my birds and it's crazy expensive to buy even a small amount.  So September last year I planted a certified seed plant into a hessian bag filled with mostly compost and some high quality soil, and a nice bed of sugar cane on top. Placed it up against the metal fence, right where it would get a ton of sun over summer.  And then I waited (and got excited when I started getting shoots) and waited, and waited some more.   It's getting colder now where I live, and the nights dropping into single digits, so the plant started yellowing and dying back.   Today I reaped the rewards for all my patience, and sure, its not exactly a giant harvest by any means, but I'm very happy with what I got.  I'm now staring at it like a proud parent whilst I figure out how to store it - didn't think that far ahead cause I wasn't expecting to get anything!",doğasever,1ke6gag

"Entire Rhubarb crop and 3/4 of crowns stolen from community garden. I've been renting a plot in a 1 acre community garden at the edge of my city for a couple years now. We have a large communal rhubarb patch that is maintained by everyone and then harvested/distributed by the main organizers throughout the spring.  The rhubarb are incredibly healthy and absolutely enormous in the summer, I wish I had pictures of them at their full size.   Someone came through overnight almost three weeks ago and harvested all the stems of rhubarb without permission. Now, someone, probably the same culprit, came through overnight and harvested all the regrowth and dug out probably 3/4 of the crowns leaving a complete mess behind. It looks like they were trying to get them all but missed some in the dark. They even managed to trample a significant portion of someone else's plot while doing it.    WTF is wrong with people? Maybe I get stealing the stems, but why would you steal the crowns at this point? There were at least a few harvests left in them. Why steal an entire communities supply of rhubarb! Now almost no one is going to get rhubarb this year and the entire community will have to wait a year or two for another harvest as the remaining plants need to be divided up and grow strong enough to be harvested. If they aren't stolen again in the meantime...",doğasever,1kddqcx

Except for this season! 15 mature trees have turned yellow! TrueGreen says that due to cold spells last winter some of them couldn’t survive. I live in Southern New Jersey. I don’t buy that justification! It did get a bit cold but in last 14 years, there have been colder winters. Someone said that the drought and warm summer followed by cold winter impacted the trees.

"Evolution of 70’ new flower bed A year ago I started planting a 70’ long flower bed along the side of our property. That’s the neighbor’s fence in the first photo. In 2022 we had several 80’ pine trees removed as they were too close to the house. We had the trees mulched and spread the wood chips over the clay NC soil.   Fast forward to 2024, we installed a fence for our new rescue dog which made the space more defined. I had a landscaper bring in a rich garden soil and then got to work. Feeling overwhelmed with such a large area, I hired a master gardener to develop a planting plan I could follow and install on my own. Last May, was planting time and I was had to adjust the plan based more shade in areas that were unexpected, but having a good base plan gave me confidence to execute a large undertaking.  This year it’s great to see plants really coming in and filling out. It will take a few years for the privacy shrubs by the fence to reach 5’, can’t really see them in the photos. It’s still a bit of a work in progress, but that’s the fun of it!  I just started gardening 5 years ago and love learning and now helping neighbors with their flowers.",doğasever,1ki9ouh

I think it’s beautiful, but want to encourage it growing more while making sure it doesn’t overgrow and kill itself. There was one main root originally but now it’s got caterpillar legs holding to the wall and some bonus roots that shot out and found the dirt. Anyways, happy Easter or happy weekend to everyone🤗",doğasever,1k325ay

"First attempt at roses This is my first home and therefore first garden. We live in a city with tightly packed houses, small yards (my backyard is bigger than most) and not a lot of privacy unless you want full drapes/shades. I needed something for privacy while on the back deck but didn’t have much room to plant anything and still get in and out of the backyard. As a child I always loved how my grandfathers English roses smelled, and after seeing my local nursery had some DA roses newly in stock I figured I’d splurge on one climbing rose as a trial, honestly thinking it may not work and that I’d probably end up killing a $70 plant. Well after I bought the rose and was waiting for the trellis to come, my fiancé surprised me with two more of the same roses. (Very sweet of him but I think it’s because he didn’t realize how big one would get and also that I might kill it haha). So I unexpectedly had three roses and honestly no other good full sun spots to put them so they all went in. I definitely planted them too close to the porch but it is what it is. Now two years later I’m a crazy rose lady and totally get the hype! Zone 7a. First planted in June 2023. Full bloom picture is this year, with Malinois (dog) for scale.  Tallest point is definitely over the “10ft” on the ID tag.  I’m sure I’ll have to take one or two out at some point, I’m just enjoying it for now. Reading on the back deck with rose scent on the breeze is like a little oasis in the city.",doğasever,1kfc1hs

I’m talking, when to prune, when to apply mulch, etc.   I plan on starting there obviously but what else should I know and where else can I start after reviewing her notes? I have no clue what I’m doing but I really want to give this a shot as I think I might enjoy it so any advice would be appreciated.   Edit: wow I was not expecting this many responses!

We changed our lawn into drought tolerant plants in 2015 when the water district offered incentives to convert.

"Admission : I think I'm addicted to dividing perennials It's so satisfying to dig them up, shake off the dirt, and tease apart the roots. Then you have more plants! For free! And you get to plant them, of course. And so find myself dividing coreopsis and coneflower and even plants I am surprised will divide end up being dividable. And then they all wilt and look terrible from the root disturbances. But around the time they look good again, I wonder if I could just divide it up a little more..? And so I'm constantly dividing, my plants are constantly in root shock, and I can't stop, won't stop.

"Anyone else wondering where the bees are? To begin, I know I could post this in r/bees but my questions is specific for gardeners. I'm in zone 8 upstate SC. Planted out all my vegetable starts over the past couple of weeks and have many pollinator-friendly plants that are flowering now. Temps have been mostly 60s at night and 70s to 80s during the day.  I have not seen a single honeybee this year. I have seen carpenter and mason bees for about a month, but no honeybees at all. I have a large pond with a waterfall - last year bees flew back and forth from it all spring and summer.  We all know that for the past few years bee populations have been declining. I'm stunned that it's May and I haven't seen a single one.  Anyone else?  EDIT thank you all for the advise about no pesticides - check. I live on several acres with meadow, water, woods. Field of clover, buckwheat and the borage is coming on. Lavender, nepeta, mountain mint, bluestem, sweetgrass. Coral honeysuckle, Carolina jasmine, American wisteria. Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries. Cherry and apple trees. I have several bee houses, bird houses, bat houses. I have had many many bees, butterflies, beetles and others for several years on this property. This year only a few masons and carpenter bees.",doğasever,1kcyjpr

"My first garden I started getting into gardening last year. I did a few herbs and some Mary Jane in pots last year and fell in love with it despite losing most of my plants to root rot from overwatering. Now we’re much more settled into the new house and this is my first real attempt at a garden.   Im so happy with my work. I did the beds with fallen and pruned limbs from our willows. Filled em with Mel’s mix. Super simple trellis for the tomatoes and other climbers. I’ve got two tomatoes in now as an experiment even though I know it’s probably too early for those (I have 9 more on top of the fridge). My lettuces I started from seed, going to get more from the nursery tomorrow. Got a raspberry and blackberry plant, I’m debating on where to put them currently. A few potatoes in 5 gallon pots. And some mint in a little pot.   I’m curious what other NY 6a gardeners have had success with and what you haven’t had much luck with? I’ve got a bunch of space that needs filling, what should I grab at the nursery tomorrow? I have swiss chard, kale, tomatoes, basil, onions and MJ started from seed already.",doğasever,1k38uvo

"DAE have a plant that has lived despite the attempts to kill it? I'm not talking an invasive species, I'm talking about one damn plant. A flower!   For the record, I am not a fan of roses. At all. So, when we bought our house in 2019, we cut out the rose bush in the back garden.   We have cut it down, sprayed with killer and have overall assisted it in leaving this world. At least until the end of 2022. (We moved away for work until mid-2024)  Yet, every year, despite the efforts, we have always been defiantly given one flower bloom every year.   This year, this beast has evolved. It is no longer just a plant but has reached its next level.   Ignoring the yard, because rains in OK stop the lawn guys from showing up, look at her this year!   4 fucking blooms coming in on what looks to be a rather sad looking plant.   She's defiant, she's stubborn and she's earned her place. I respect it.   I may even clean her up a little when the rain stops. I do know that when the new beds are built along the house, she's got her spot already picked out.   I concede.",doğasever,1k8i1qc

This year, a totally random singular tulip popped up in the front of our house, and here it is. It's the same yellow as our eastern facing tulip patch, but has this shocking-red heterochromatic effect. Wild.

"Today my first ever Papaver Orientale bloomed and it's the most stunning flower I've ever laid eyes on. The flower is the size of a large chalice with reds so vibrant I actually had to desaturate it slightly in photoshop first due to it exceeding the limit of the sensor.   For those interested, I am in Zone 9B up in Mendocino County (California) near the coast. The flower is in a large planter with cheap garden soil called EB Organics.",doğasever,1k5e59t
"Training morning glories up and across my porch I trained morning glory vines to climb my porch posts, but once they reached the top, I needed a better way to guide/constrain them to grow horizontally across the span. To that end, I made some simple clips, they mount with a small brad/finish nail and open/close with a removable spring clip. This helps me lock the vines in place and control the direction of growth.   I know morning glory's often get a bad rap here for being prolific and non native, but they are my wife's favorite flower and  she loves seeing the humming birds they attract. I'm able to control any unwanted spreading by never planting them anywhere an escaped plant could avoid notice, no overgrown fence lines or inviting forests to hide in. I also collect the seed pods as they mature and any that escape me end up in the lawn where they get mown over if/when they attempt unauthorized growth!",doğasever,1kjgcca

"My back yard I had it put in last July. I hired a gardening crew to take out the sod, installed the rocks, the major shrubs, the trees, and the irrigation system. I filled in with a number of shrubs, ground covers. By then it was late fall and nothing did much. By winter (Cleveland suburbs) it looked like nothing more than a bunch of rocks and I was nearly heartbroken. It wasn’t anything like the Japanese garden oasis I had envisioned.   But now everything is coming back and I’m very happy!  Everything is larger, things are blooming, the design is starting to make sense. It will never be a proper Japanese garden and I’m OK with that - I have neither the discipline nor the vision to create something like that and instead I have a landscape where I can try new plants, create vignettes, and just enjoy my passion. I try new things, move things around, take out plants that just don’t bring joy and divide/replant things that do.   Here’s how it looks this first Spring. My experience has been with West Coast landscaping and most of these plants are new to me. I’ve made mistakes, and if you see any I’d really like to hear what you think.",doğasever,1kkgyrq
"The best part of gardening In my opinion. The best part of gardening isn’t having a flower or vegetable in your hand, but starting it all off. In April when you first fill your pots with soil.

It was a big part of my childhood so I'm very upset.  It was always left to its own devices and it was happy, I live in Greece and almond trees are native here, they pop up everywhere in my area. Could it have just reached the end of its life? I couldn't find much info on how long almond trees live, only for ""production years"".

"I have no idea what I'm doing. Please give suggestions (Central NJ) Ok. So my husband and I finally decided we want to make our front yard more presentable. We've been in the house for a year now.   I really love nature and bugs and I want to encourage the pollinators to hang out. Great! Grab some flowery perennials.   Thing is, I have no idea what I'm doing. We stirred up all the dirt. We grabbed plants that we were told are hardy and like the direct sun that this spot gets (this pic was taken at 7am, full sun hits soon)  There's a lot of spots to fill in, but we're unsure of what would work here. The soil under is a bit sandy because it's right up against the foundation of the house. I THINK the soil is kinda basic because we have a hydrangea bush on the side that's pink (is that accurate btw? The hydrangea flower color thing???) and an azalea bush that takes off every year.   I wanna give our new lil bush on the left plenty of room to grow, but I also hate all those dead spots. I don't wanna put perennials in there because they'd just eventually get nuked by the bush right? Would it make sense to put annuals down around it to fill in the space?   Suggestions are very welcome. I am an idiot. My understanding of gardening is reading the labels at the garden center and hoping for the best. I keep fish so I dump fish water into the flower beds, which works great for my few house plants.   Help.   Ignore the weird layout btw were building this up week by week.",doğasever,1kkq0c1

It was very wet and may be a natural spring under the plot. It was even wetter early this spring, but has since dried out and the daffodils popped up more as I expected them too the first spring. I’m happy nonetheless! Although, in the future I will likely do clusters with more closely planted bulbs as opposed to large blobs. If you have a few duds they really are noticeable in a blob.

It's physically difficult for me to get down to that level, and when I've had pot plants I've always managed to kill them by forgetting to water them because of ADHD.

I went home and put it in water, half intending to plant it but not expecting it to last long.   This thing survived in that water cup and even grew a new leaf all the way until my birthday in March- and I knew at that point I wanted to be serious about it because this might be the one plant I don't kill. For my birthday mum got me a bag of soil, a pot, and some other garden tools and accessories, and I've been diligently keeping an eye on it and watering it- and not only is it still alive but it's thriving!   When we were at bunnings mum asked if I wanted a cheap pot or a nice pot and I told her to get a cheap one for now, and if it's still alive by Christmas I want her to buy me one od the cool looking ones I saw 😊  I think I might enjoy this. I've wanted to build a garden and I think this is a good first step",doğasever,1k826ek

"Tulip Time! Zone 7A (Long Island). And to think a few weeks ago I was convinced this was going to be an ‘off year’ for my tulips—how wrong I was! Tips: dig up old tulips every few years (after all green foliage is gone) and plant in the fall with new bulbs, a garden auger of multiple sizes (helps with big bulbs and alliums), supplemental bone meal in every hole seems to help.   Solution for squirrels and other pests: don’t bother dumping red pepper flakes anywhere, that didn’t help. Just plant enough to compensate & feed the birds as a distraction (blue jays and squirrels now seem to have a war going on)",doğasever,1k6c6wj

We planted a mix of shrubs, flowers and vegetables that are great for wildlife and give us blooms all season long.

"First Season of Gardening! This was my first season of gardening!   Last summer I bought my first home. The home itself was well maintained but the yard needed a ton of work. My partner and I spent all spring clearing the yard and pruning the trees/bushes and getting rid of invasive plants.  We planted kale, tomatoes, raspberries, blueberries, sunflowers, zinnias and dahlias as annuals. As well as put in tons of perennials where we cleared out old leaves.  I think my favorite part of growing is the flowers! This past month I’ve really enjoyed cutting flowers and making bouquets for my home and friends.  A couple of lessons I learned:  1. The plants that did the best had better soil conditions   2. Don’t try and plant perennials during the heat of the summer  3. Don’t plant veggies you don’t want to eat  I had zero gardening experience going in and I learned a lot about plants this season. I can’t wait for next spring!",doğasever,1fw23o2

"My year in review It was a lot of work, especially as an organic gardener doing it all on my own, but I’m very proud of what I accomplished. There were a few big flops and lessons learned but it was a very abundant year overall.   Here are some of my takeaways (zone 6a): • Interplanting is a super power if designed right. I did a variation on the three sisters that worked amazingly well: corn, soybean for edamame, and russet potatoes. My corn was chest high by the Fourth of July  • Planting tightly can be beneficial for weed suppression but my brassicas are not forgiving if they feel crowded. • The Earthway precision seeder was useful but also a huge janky pain in the ass. I wish I just sucked it up and bought a Jang seeder • If you have the space, a row dedicated to beneficials and trap plants can be very useful. It became like a real life tower defense game for me: looking up what bugs might eat my plants then figuring out what I should plant to distract them or attract their enemies. Very nerdy. Very fun. • Onion sets in clay soils should be planted as deeply as recommended or they pus their way to the top of the bed and become de facto spring onions.  • An overhead sprinkler is not an efficient way to water if you’re worried about weeds. I’m getting drip lines next year. • I need to soil test before finalizing planting designs for next year. • Harvest sunflower seeds before the head dries out, otherwise it’s like my dating life here in Colorado: a crunchy mess. • Making Indian saag dishes is a fantastic way to go through excessive amounts of spinach.  • Grasshoppers are jerks and I want an army of chickens next year.

"I recently moved into a new apartment with a garden and wanted to fix it up a bit, I made a small sketch of an idea. It's quite a bit bigger in person than in the photos. It's around 35m² or 375 square feet.    I wanted to make it look a bit more clean and modern. Hang some plants on the walls and just make it feel more lively.   My dad thought I should keep the stone floor and just clean it up, because it feels more expensive. But personally I think wooden planks would look a bit nicer.    I also wanted the planks to match the height of the floor so that you don't have to take such a big step down from the apartment.    And to border the grass with lighter stone bricks around it.    I was curious about some feedback and what could work or not work in the garden.    Thank you for reading!",doğasever,1fv5mfv

The reason I'm posting is because the American Primrose society is starting their seed exchange this weekend and at a dollar per packet, its a wonderful opportunity to try something new. You must be a member to order in the first round, but the exchange opens up to the public in February.  americanprimrosesociety.org   Feel free to PM if you have questions or would like recommendations on species for your garden conditions.

"Does growing your own food make you wonder how groceries are so cheap? I know grocery prices feel harsh because we all hafta eat, but seriously. I am a hobby gardener. I prefer growing flowers honestly. But I have a small kitchen garden because fresh lettuce, tomatoes, peas, greens, zucchini and herbs are delicious and fun.  But I planted peas in March. I have eaten a few along the way as snacks fresh from the pod, but  after 2 months, my biggest harvest is 12 oz of peas. Hey, I am proud of them, they are about to be lunch. But I have a bag of 10 oz of frozen peas in the freezer and they cost me $1.50. A dollar and fifty cents.  When I think about all the work and expense of growing peas (and I realize it's more economical to plant acres of peas, bit still) it boggles my mind that peas planted far away, processed, packaged, and shipped still cost so little money. And when you think about how much more work goes into something like say cookies - without getting all Henny Penny just think of all the growers and all the steps - how are.you selling me a bag of cookies for a few bucks?

My first pumpkin stand 🥹 Over the weekend I had my first pumpkin stand! 🥹 I was so nervous no one would buy a single pumpkin and I’d be sad but it was a huge success!! I did 2 days for about 2 hours each day and it was so fun!!   I got to meet so many people from the community and the feedback was awesome. Everyone was so excited for me and nice and even if they didn’t want to buy a pumpkin they stopped and said this was so cool and good job.   The first location on day 1 was my local grocery store and while I only got 4 customers it was the perfect test run. I actually ran into a bunch of neighbors and members of my church and it was nice chatting and showing them my pumpkins. Check out the pic of me and my first customer 😭 he was such a good sport   Day 2 I went to a heavier foot traffic location in my old neighborhood by the beach before I moved to the farm and got 3x the customers… haha so maybe 12? 😅 my stepdad made me a sign to hold & I just waved at everyone.   I just wanted to post to encourage other gardeners and farmers to set up a table on your yard and sell to your neighbors! Even if you are nervous and think no one will want your stuff. They were all thrilled and asking what else I had. They asked what days I was going to be here every week and were just as excited as me. I also met other cool gardeners and chatted all things gardening while I worked on my tan 🤙 🤍,doğasever,1g8rnbk

"This small harvest feels like a huge win! This was my first year gardening, and let me tell you—slugs apparently thought I was opening a Michelin-starred buffet just for them. They devoured – no: annihilated – pretty much everything I planted! 🐌  Dahlias? Like I never planted a thing.  Pumpkin? Merely a snack. Chillies? YUM! Zinnias? Didn’t last two days. Beans? Four rounds of nothing. You get the picture.   So it feels like the most amazing win that I got to take home this little harvest today.🥰 I’m especially happy about the cosmos and the chard, as I planted A TON and only one plant each survived.   It just makes me so happy and so hopeful for next year, so I thought I’d share.

The kids and I would sit out there and  it was a great escape.   Something extremely traumatic happened to us and we all had to leave in the middle of the night several months ago. I finally went back today and everything is dead. I knew there would be nothing left but I just stood there and cried. I’ve been struggling and we’ve finally gotten to a new place where I can start over but the thought of all the work and money is overwhelming right now.

"Don't ever let them tell you it can't be done. I live in one of the most challenging places in the US to garden on a large scale; every year I take a breath and say ""challenge accepted"". Just outside of Laramie, Wyoming.  Zone 4a; 7200' elevation.  Growing season averages 3 months.  One of the windiest places on the entire continent, and frost/snow is a threat almost year round. Mountains on both sides of me also cut down on daylight hours.  It certainly has its challenges and is a ton of work, but don't ever give up.  Year after year I pull off the impossible, in spite of June snowstorms, August freezes, repeated hailstorms, nonstop 30+ mph sustained winds (with much higher gusts), and more.  Anything is possible if you put in the work and research.  (Pictured are my yearly staples...pumpkins, sweet corn, cherry tomatoes, carrots, and lettuce.  I also have strawberries [not really visible here but yea]).  I feed the entire neighborhood several times over because ""go big or go home"" is apparently my default state of being.  Corn is the toughest; it's always a last-minute ""hold your breath"" affair in the fall.  Starting most things indoors, along with liberal use of stakes, windbreaks, and frost covers, makes it viable.  Most serious folk around here build greenhouses or raised beds, but I make do without.  That's not to say there aren't failures and devastating events.  But the successes outweigh the failures by far.  Good luck to everyone the rest of the year!",doğasever,1e7x4uv

"Wisteria Confession Like Dr. Frankenstein with his creature, I had a vision to grow wisteria, and I disregarded all warnings. I was blinded by my hubris.  I thought I was careful, planting it somewhere safe. I was was arrogant though, underestimating its capacity and drive to live it's own life.  It got out of control quickly, reaching beyond what I thought was possible. So I responded, cutting it back, trying to limit its growth. I couldn't contain it.   But just like Dr. Frankenstein, I considered my creature to be an abomination, one that must be contained or destroyed. The wisteria, I believed, was a monster.  Then I realized... I thought I had created a monster. But it's just a life, trying to live. Yearning for growth and life doesn't make something a monster.   But hubris... arrogance...

"HELP! Neglected rosemary THRIVING but favourite one DYING ?? Hey guys! We have two rosemary bushes, one is my boyfriends mother’s bush, and the other is from her funeral (my boyfriend just put it into an empty garden pot and it turned into the great big lush rosemary bush that’s in the pictures).  The one that looks dry and dying (her bush) used to be so lush, full of wonderful bees and I loved using it in all my cooking. It was flowering regularly, and grew so large, until one day my boyfriends dad decided to trim it back down (it was getting a bit hectic). When he trimmed it, it began to look ill - the tips turned brown and it started to wilt, I think we were over watering it, so I stopped doing that. Then he cut it back some more and it just looked so miserable. We thought it needed new soil so about 4 weeks ago they pulled it out, trimmed the roots and then repotted it, and ever since it’s just so so sad and dry. I’ve used Seasol and slow release fertiliser to help it, but it’s just looking so dry. I’ve watered it every day but it’s getting more and more dry. The leaves are so dry they just crumble.  On the contrary, the other bush is the one that barely gets any water let alone attention. My partner and his dad empty their beer, wine, coca-cola bottles into it (along with cigarettes that get put oit in empty beer bottles). It’s just THRIVING, however it’s never flowered. E Does anyone know why the other bush is dying rapidly? Could it be from the trimming / cutting back of the bush? It does get FAR more sunlight than the other bush, but it’s been in the same spot for years and we live in Australia so it’s typically hot through summer and it’s survived 48 degree (118F) sunny days. It only started going dry and dying after it was trimmed and then repotted. Any diagnoses / help / tips would be greatly appreciated because neither of us are gardeners! <3",doğasever,1h8n6mt

"Had a pretty successful garlic harvest this season, documented the process For anyone interested in growing their own garlic, it's been my favorite crop and I found it fairly easy to get good results. This is year 2 and I wanted to document the process this time.  We started with some bulbs we bought at a farmer's market, and kept the biggest cloves to plant (32). The cloves used this time are from our first harvest that we kept to replant, and STILL had all the garlic we could want for a year from those first 32.  THE PROCESS:  4x8x12"" bed, 128 holes for 128 cloves, spaced 6"" apart and 3"" from the edge of the bed. Planted on Halloween, zone 7b. Covered loosely with about 6-8"" of straw and did not touch the bed all winter.   Uncovered mid March, probably could have made the straw a little looser. Some of the sprouts were packed down pretty tightly, but they recovered fine after a couple weeks of spring sunlight (and some careful watering from my Chief of Hydration Operations).  We had some freak snow in early April that only lasted a day, the greens were sad but they bounced back. By late April the biggest stalks were as thick as my thumb.  In early June I re-applied a 3-4"" layer of straw between the stalks to retain moisture (not pictured here). It gets quite hot here in late spring and I was noticing some withering.  Harvest was June 16th. Total of 124 bulbs harvested. Not sure if some didn't make it due to the cold winter we had last year (about 8 to 10°F / -13 to -12°C is unusually cold for where I live), or it might have been due to the denseness of the straw suffocating the sprouts. Either way, I'm fine with the 97% success rate.   THE DETAILS:   Soil is roughly a 50/50 mix of sandy topsoil and compost from my own bin. My compost is mostly grass clippings supplemented by food scraps, very nitrogen heavy and not much fiber. This made for a denser soil mix than I would have liked for garlic, so I will supplement with pearlite next time to loosen it up.  The bed is 4x8x12 with a layer of old firewood taking up the bottom half to cut the amount of soil needed significantly. This didn't seem to impede root formation at all (see curing rack photo).  I only lightly fertilized once with some general 16-16-16 mix, in mid April after the sprouts had matured. Probably wasn't necessary but I have a bunch so I used it.  Drying rack is a 2x4 wire shelf in a non-temp controlled garage with a cheap box fan bungee corded to the side, on high. I hung them for 4 weeks, which was about a week too long (we went camping and didn't get to take them in before we left).  Total harvest after curing and trimming was just over 11 lb, typical bulb sizes ranging from about 40-60g, with a few outliers up to 75g (which I will replant). Assuming 10-12 cloves per bulb, we have 1,240 - 1,488 cloves, or enough for roughly three to four loaves of garlic bread.   ---  Thanks for reading! If you're still here, AMA! I'm happy to share my experience and help fill the world with garlic! Garlic = Love.",doğasever,1edtoci

My 4 year old has also shown a lot of interest and I want to show her how important it is to keep trying.

harvesting pumpkins from the river so basically because of the floods some cargo or something like that dropped those pumpkins into the water maybe even a field got flooded judging by the fact that not all seeds were developed and the pumpkins might have been to soon to be picked and transported for commercial purposes. I saw them floating down stream I saw more than 50 most of them were cracked though I took only 3. this is a pumpkin type used for seeds but the flesh can be eaten as well. cut open only the most scetchy looking one of the 3 I took. and it turned out to be perfectly fine the riverbank is gonna be a pumpkin field next year,doğasever,1fi33vg

"FIL weed whacked my shade garden Im absolutely livid. The dude is a nightmare trying to control him. He only ever visits for a week or so (from out of the county) but he always manages to make some sort of decision that is so unbelievably weird and frustrating. He did this while I was at work and my husband was busy with something else.   I had Japanese ferns, sword ferns, a whole bunch of random variegated unidentified leafy stuff I got at a local plant sale. Masterwort. Huckleberry. Hellebores. Thyme. Pineapple sage. The lilac bush. The neighbors’ blackberries that come over the fence. And the crown jewel of insults, a unique red and yellow columbine that has massive sentimental value as I collected it from the wild on a trip with my dad who passed away. I have columbine out the wazoo but that’s the only one of those, it doesn’t seem to breed true with the store bought varieties and their dominant genes.   So anyway, I realize that this is pretty much all perennials and will probably bounce back just fine. I just need advice on how to help it do that, so I can be reasonably sure nothing dies for real. Should I leave it alone? Water it frequently? Would fertilizer help it get foliage back? Please help.    Edit: thanks to everyone who gave me the advice I actually needed, I’ll probably end up watering well the next while and adding some sort of slow fertilizer or something.   To everyone who has gone through something like this, I’m so sorry. It’s absolutely gut wrenching.   To everyone else, Jesus Christ yall need to calm down. FIL is probably autistic and we don’t speak the same language [another edit: literally, he speaks Korean and I speak English. I’m not trying to be mean. He and I literally speak different languages.] He and MIL are visiting at the moment from overseas and they are almost never here, maybe every other year. When they are here, my husband has his dad help with all the major projects that need doing. FIL has a hard time taking instructions or listening to other people and often gets an idea that might not be the best but seems great in his mind. It comes from a place of love, he really just wants to help us make the place its best self. He’s just real-life Goofy and does dumb stuff. The dude has fallen off of roofs and broken limbs doing dumb stuff. He’s just not all there in the head. In his mind, my slightly grassy spent wildflowery shade patch was pretty weedy looking. My husband was clearing an area adjacent to the garden, and had FIL weed whack that. Husband got distracted and FIL continued weed whacking what he thought was obviously weeds.

The joys of gardening Was hoping to quickly plant a couple of perennials before work. Hit a rock and ended up taking the afternoon off and not achieving much. The boulder didn’t even move an 1/4 of an inch. At 18” x 15” x 7” my guess is it weighs 300lbs or so. What to do? I’m hoping I can leave my JM there and in 5-10 years it will just develop roots around it.  I measured and the top of the boulder is about 6 inches to the soil line. Any recommendations on what to plant in this spot that is not ground cover? Annuals maybe? Would you raise the soil line by a couple of inches?,doğasever,1czumut

Found something much different instead:   “Three weeks after a wasp lays its egg inside a hapless beetle, a wasp larvae bursts from her belly and weaves itself a cocoon between her legs. The ladybug doesn’t die, but becomes paralyzed, involuntarily twitching her spotted red carapace to ward off predators until the adult wasp emerges a week later.”   Wild! 😳   Has anyone heard of or encountered this before? Wondering if I should remove/eradicate the leaf or let it be?    Source:      +more info about the egg deposit and virus if you’re interested:

"The Great Northern Tulip Experiment Returns! The Great Northern Tulip Experiment Returns!  Some of you may remember my Alaskan tulip misadventures from last year [The Great Northern Tulip Experiment/Debacle](  Did I learn my lesson and just accept my tulipless fate?  My parents might have raised an idiot, but they didn't raise a quitter.  After countless hours trolling the interwebs for wholesale bulb suppliers, dozens of e-mails, and a handful of telephone calls I settled on using Roozengarde out of Washington for Round 2.  I braved the deliciously vicious eyerolls from my darling Mamacake, informing her that I was going to try again and order some more tulips, promising that it would be fewer than last time.  And I did order fewer tulip bulbs (4,000) than I ***received*** in fall 2022 (7,900), so technically I wasn't lying and she never thought to limit daffodils, so who was I to question my freedom?  I did limit myself to only 500 each of the white and yellow cheerfulness daffodils.  Roozengarde was simply phenomenal to work with, keeping me up to date on which of their bulbs would be in the first harvest and getting exactly what I ordered shipped up to me in mid September without a hitch.  But Mamacake had some serious questions waiting for me when I returned from my moose hunt.  Something about 16 packages of bulbs that showed up.  She was gracious enough to help me plant them, despite her moral superiority on my semantic evasions from months earlier.  We got the beds planted, mulched over, and set in for the long winter.  As the snow began to recede from the tulip grotto in early April, my excitement began to rise uncontrollably.  April 8 showed the first tulip tips breaking free of their frozen beds.  THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE WORKED!!!!  Mamacake and I began making our daily, often multiple times, walks to inspect the progress with impatience.  In short order, thousands and thousands of tulips were breaking through.  By May 18 we officially had our first open tulip bloom, with countless others right behind it.  Things are not yet at what I would call ""peak"" blooming, but we're close enough that we're calling it a success!  The daffodils are a late variety and are taking their sweet time, but we've got a handful of blooms up in the last 3 days.  Mamacake has made it absolutely clear:  I AM NOT ALLOWED TO BUY ANY TULIP BULBS THIS YEAR.  But she didn't say anything about crocuses...",doğasever,1d7grm8

"Most productive Red Raspberry vs 6 others Video is of Himbo Top in October 2024. Most productive to least: 1. Himbo Top- Red 2. Joan J- Red 3. Anne Yellow- Yellow 4. Nantahala- Red 5. Bababerry- Red 6. Glencoe- Purple 7. Heritage- Red  Most productive Raspberry vs 6 other varieties- zone 10B SoCal  The most productive coming from a bare-root as a primocane (first year) has been the Himbo Top good size- about an inch- which is what is in the video. It’s also almost thornless.  Joan J comes in 2nd on most productive but tastes more rich and is completely thornless and more dark when ripe. In any case any of these tastes much better home grown and not bitter like the store bought kind.  The best tasting has been the Nantahala- about 3/4 inch. Tastes like candy even when not fully ripe, but isn’t as productive and has needle-like thorns. I moved it this year to a cooler place so hopefully it does better.  Anne Yellow tastes like apricots and it’s mildly productive and will keep it only for its unique flavor but also has thorns.   Bababerry grew fast but is barely producing now in December.   Heritage died on me and never produced.  Glencoe has yet to produce but really stretched out this year- 8 foot trailing canes as is thornless.   I got the Himbo Tops from Burnt Ridge nursery. Ordered 5 bare roots with a huge root system. Received them in January, planted in garden mix, peat moss and perlite. Added mycorrhizae and acidic fertilizer that I use for my blueberries and they took off!! I had fruit by May/June all the way until Early December.

"Update on the first year of our front yard veggie garden Our front yard garden is nearing the end of its first growing season!  We learned so many things along the way, and had a ton of success, considering this was the first year. We were so lucky that we got so much positive feedback from our neighbors and community members. Everybody was excited about the front yard garden! I hope to see other people doing the same next year.   Here's what we accomplished in our first year: 1. Built our own raised cedar beds (5 10ft×4ft, 2 10ftx2ft, 1 4ftx4ft)  2. Got a gardening soil blend delivered in bulk (7 yards!) Which is way more than you would think it is and a crapload of work to get into the beds   3. Used cardboard to line the beds, and added the soil, no need to remove the grass  4. Mulched everything with straw, which kept out the neighborhood cats, blocked weeds, and kept moisture in the soil, even on hot days (hooray for not watering every day). Seriously, if you do one thing on this list, do this one. It's a lazy gardeners dream!  5. Planted most from seed and started our plants indoors with grow lights  6. After having a sneaky veggie theif in our garden, we got a motion sensor sprinkler and never lost another crop  7. Honestly had more produce than we could even harvest, but have frozen a bunch for canning later  Next year, we will mulch the paths with wood chips, and add in drip irrigation, and a fence along the driveway.

"So what's going on with this hosta? I grabbed a few of these this spring from the nursery I work at when the bare roots came in. This one got potted up and put into the greenhouse to grow out. I noticed this ""thing"" a week or so, and finally brought it home because it is just too ugly not to love. The other two hostas are in the ground and doing great, but this thing is just too weird.   Is this just some mutation, or is it diseased?  I would love to put it in the ground just to see what it might come back as next spring, but I'm also slightly afraid to put it around my other hostas.

"She came with the house, ten years later and still thriving Looking at old photos, she started as a few feet tall.  She's been through a lot. Been here around ten years, wasn't much into plants and gardening for years but she survived thanks likely to ariel roots and karl's humidity (karl's the fog that comes from the ocean, doesn't reach here much but th humidity does).   At one point, she was attrached to the house literally #badIdea. But turns out paint isn't that strong, so she snapped -- but didn't fully break. The two leaves on left are from the growth point that activated below the break, but the top continued to grow...  till it got stuck between the deck beams for a while (thus the wonky leaves on right).  I'm in zone 10, but Karl keeps us cool, likely limiting her growth, but at least that keeps her somewhat manageable.

"UPDATE: The case of the missing Lithodora. So on popular demand, I bring you an update regrading the Lithodora abduction.   Like many speculated, it wasn't a deer, rabbit, gopher, squirrel, dog, cat, child, teenager... it was in fact, a boomer.   She seemed to know what she was doing, spent some time waiting for the perfect opportunity, pacing around the plants for a bit, and then in one swoop, the plant was squirreled into her bag. I was frankly astonished by the level of finese and speed. Clearly not her first rodeo.    Now for the burning question... I have no fucking clue who this person is (I've obstructed her face due to EU GDPR laws and all that). She didn't seem to greet any of the locals (we tend to yell each other's names and make idle chats, a usual walk that would be 2min, can easily turn into a 20min one), but her clothes don't give me the ""tourist vibe"" so I'm guessing either a recent transplant or maybe she's from a local village. My fiancée speculates that she might have gone to church on Sunday (I'm right across the church on the main square) noticed the plants and came back yesterday with a clear plan. Luckily, I'm good friends with the priest, he's my age, so I'll ask if she's part of his flock.    I'll also ask around the village, not so much because I wish to confront the old limping hag, but just so the word gets out – in hopes that it reaches her, and makes her feel poopy.   In other news, found a new Lithodora and I've planted her into her new home. But I did up my game this time, made rings around the base and tied them to the wooden stands used for training the Jasmine and I've set up a sign warning off boomers that big brother is watching.   Was contemplating adding sewing needles into the soil... but tetanus is a shitty way to go. Hope this will be enough for now!",doğasever,1jlwd24

I planted my first batch in mid-October after temps finally dropped below 90°F and saw my first blooms around early March!  Here are the varieties I planted: 	•	Ranunculus Romance Seine 	•	Ranunculus Romance Nohant  	•	Ranunculus Cloni Hanoi  	•	Ranunculus Tecolote Pink/Orange  	•	Ranunculus Elegance Bianco/Crema  	•	Ranunculus Elegance Sfumato 	•	Ranunculus Elegance Ciclamino 	•	Ranunculus Success Fragolino  I grew them in raised beds amended with worm castings, compost, and perlite, and I followed a staggered bloom schedule to try and get waves of flowers. I fertilized with a 0-10-10 bloom booster mid-season to support tuber development for saving. So far, I’m thrilled! A few are still blooming, but many are just now starting to die back—and I’m excited to cure and save corms for next season.  Ranunculus might be my new favorite cool-season flower.

"I planted like 10,000 wildflowers and now I’m in a pickle Uhhh as short as possible:   I got a few $2 boxes of wildflower mixed seeds from dollar general. Some sunny, some shade.   I started a small percentage, idk, maybe 2%? in an egg carton in the windowsill. The other 98% I just wandered around and sprinkled all over the property without much regard to what I was doing (I am in a weird mental place right now!).  I assumed they were probably nothing more than sawdust and nothing would sprout. But lo and behold. I have seedlings. Not just in the windowsill. EVERYWHERE.  This is not a problem, per se, I love the idea of having lots of wildflowers, but I don’t know what to do next! They’re certainly overcrowded.. when, and how, do I choose the hardiest ones to continue on? Or do they sort that out themselves?  Google is garbage these days - I thought asking real experienced people would be quicker and more informative.  EDIT: I’ve never had to make this type of edit before! Yall are SO kind, and so so helpful. I’m still absorbing and learning a lot.. don’t stop haha. I’ll respond. I hope you all enjoyed a mostly happy day today  EDIT 2: another commenter recommended, and I agree, that I should discourage any of the rest of you reading from buying random DG seeds!

When I first washed them, no visible worms or holes in the potatoes. As soon as I had them submerged for more than 2 minutes in the vinegar water I saw 2. Then 4. Now of course I couldn’t hope to count them. They are dead, mostly, there was one live one.   In the previous post there was much speculation about type of worms, most convincing suggestion to me was nematodes. I live in Oregon, I grew these in my backyard.

"I lied to my roommate (I swear I'm not on the wrong sub) My new roommate is a refugee from Ukraine. He's a sweet guy, but he's very clearly *not okay* emotionally. Even before he told me anything, it was amply clear this person went through hell. He's one of those people who puts up with everything and anything that's thrown at him, and just doesn't expect anything good, ever. Poor guy was close to tears because I made him dinner at one point.  He doesn't know anything about plants, but he very quickly understood that's something I was into (The balcony full of plants may have been a hint...).  A couple of days after he moved in, he brought home a couple of small bulbs he found on his jobsite. He seemed excited and shyly asked if I could plant them for him. I did. He kept asking whether or not they sprouted, and it seems like he's pretty invested with the whole thing.  Meanwhile, I started suspecting those bulbs are not viable, for whatever reason. And since this is one of the few things I've seen him hyped about, I sure as hell didn't want to disappoint him when/if they don't sprout.  I went today and secretly bought a bulb of a native plant - something that would make sense he would find on a construction site, and similar enough so it's not obvious - and planted it in an identical pot, ready to swap them as soon as it starts growing.  **Edit:** I definitely did not expect to get this much attention. For all I saw it, I was just sharing random shenanigans that amused me and I had nobody to share with. Now definitely on the lookout for sunflowers.",doğasever,17p7y0v

"Survey for parents/caregivers to children aged 2-12 - looking at what children know about sharks Hi everyone,  I am a scientist from Australia + I am looking for participants, around the world, for some new research I am doing.  Are you the parent/caregiver of a child aged 2-12 years? If so, we kindly invite you to participate in our short online survey about sharks. We are interested in what children know about sharks, so this survey involves you completing a couple of questions about sharks, and then asking your children some questions about sharks. You will then be asked to write what your children say or what they do (e.g. if they use hand gestures).  LINK TO SURVEY:  [  **Please also feel free to send to any one you know who might be interested.**  The survey takes approximately ten minutes per child to complete, if you have more than one child aged between 2-12 they can all participate.  This study has received ethics approval from the University of South Australia (#206267). If you have any queries, please contact the lead researcher: [Brianna.lebusque@unisa.edu.au](mailto:Brianna.lebusque@unisa.edu.au)",doğasever,1gap411

"Sweet William Dianthus Flowers I love sweet Williams, they are absolutely beautiful, and I really want to write poems about them, here's one poem about sweet Williams that I read a few minutes ago: This particular year, the Sweet Williams were amazing The seeds had planted themselves everywhere Every color of the rainbow too Each time I went outside, all I could do was stare.  But, it wasn't just the Sweet William, you see The Roses were tall and handsome with grace The pinks, the reds, the brilliant yellow Ah yes, they gave summer an astounding embrace.  I hope you too have flowers that make you smile How sad it would be to frown instead I hope you see colors and enjoy fragrances Of your spectacular flower bed!  By: Marilyn Lott",doğasever,1bx165o

"Adorable Japanese Bee Fly! 🐝 🪰 ⚡️📸 Lovely Photograph of a Japanese Bee Fly! 🐝❤️ The Japanese beefly (Bombylius japonicus) is a species of fly native to Japan and other parts of East Asia. These flies are known for their resemblance to bees, with hairy bodies and a suspended flight pattern. They are often found in open habitats such as fields and grasslands, where they feed on the nectar of flowers. Despite their bee-like appearance, Japanese bee flies don't sting and are harmless to humans. They play a role in pollination, as they visit flowers to feed, which makes them beneficial insects in their ecosystems. 📷: Unknown",doğasever,1ek8i64

"Never thought I'd actually be lucky enough to find one of these adorable things in real life!? So after nabbing a compound microscope for under $500 I literally just walked 100m to the local park scraped a bit of moss from a tree and put it in a plastic sauce container. I then let it sit for a couple hours before stirring the moss around and using a small plastic pipette to suck up sone liquid from the bottom and then drip a few drops onto a microscope slide. Added a couple of cover slips, sat down to enjoy the meditatory experience of panning through the microscopic world, and then suddenly -  BAM!  Gorgeous 6-legged cuddly little bear!   Ughhh he's so cute i just want to squish him with my hugs... contemplating keeping him as a pet actually, but that depends on whether I can think of a name that's cool enough 🤔   Anyway, hope you enjoy his little feetsies as he plays around 🥰",doğasever,1iaj4iw
