"The Devastation of Pacific Palisades | Burn Zone of the Palisades Fire | Los Angeles Wildfires (2025) [04:49] A chronicling of events and aerial tour of the Palisades Fire burn zone in the aftermath of the Los Angeles Wildfires in Southern California.       On the morning of January 7th, 2025, a small brush fire was reported in the    Santa Monica Mountains above Pacific Palisades.      Fueled by 80 MPH Santa Ana winds, the fire quickly spread down to the Pacific Ocean.      Thousands of acres went up in flames along its destructive path as 30,000 people were evacuated and 13,000 structures threatened. Another 100,000  people were on high alert for evacuation.      Over 4,700 firefighters were deployed to combat the Palisades Fire, but the firestorm continued to rage out of control for weeks.      Pacific Palisades is devastated.       Nearly every structure north of Sunset Blvd. has been destroyed.      Beachfront homes along the Pacific Coast Highway are burnt to the ground, and entire neighborhoods turned to ash overnight.      The wildfire continued to advance west along the coast towards Malibu, razing some of the most valuable celebrity homes in America.       High in the mountains above the Palisades, the fire finally began to slow as it ran out of fuel climbing the steep hills. Exhausted firefighters battled the blaze for 24 days until it was fully contained.       The Palisades Fire grew to 23,448 acres before 100% containment and few fortunate homes survived.      6,837 structures burned and 12 people lost their lives.      The Palisades Fire is the most destructive fire in the history of Los Angeles.",belgeselsever,1kl8ow9

"Ghosts of K2 (2001) [0:48:18] – A Haunting Look at Ambition, Tragedy, and the World's Most Dangerous Mountain Ghosts of K2 – A Chilling Tribute to Ambition, Obsession, and the Cost of Greatness  Ghosts of K2 is not just a documentary about a mountain—it’s a haunting tribute to ambition, obsession, and the steep price of greatness. I watched it recently, and it’s lingered with me ever since. I’m not a paid reviewer, just a fan of a good mountaineering story.  The documentary traces the history of expeditions on K2 through the stories of legendary climbers like Pete Schoening, focusing on two key events: the 1939 tragedy and the iconic moment known as ""The Belay.""  As someone who enjoys mountaineering literature but has never climbed myself, I wasn’t familiar with Fritz Wiessner before this. The film does a fantastic job portraying Wiessner’s prodigious skill, bold vision, and, at times, controversial leadership—brought to life through thoughtful interviews and rare archival footage (I was genuinely surprised some even existed). When the 1939 disaster unfolds and Wiessner reflects on the mountain “shutting” him out after coming agonizingly close to the summit, it evokes both awe and sorrow—for a man history seems to have largely forgotten. Mallory, by contrast, is granted a kind of romantic mythos for his final Everest attempt, while Wiessner remains in the shadows.  Then there’s The Belay—a legendary moment in mountaineering lore. Pete Schoening’s humble, almost casual retelling of how he stopped five men from plummeting to their deaths is quietly breathtaking. When he describes the relief of the pressure finally easing on the rope, I couldn’t help but mutter, “Legend.”  If I had one (very minor) critique, it’s that after these two emotionally intense and gripping stories, the final summit feels slightly underwhelming. Not due to poor storytelling, but simply because what comes before is so compelling.  All in all, Ghosts of K2 is a beautifully crafted, deeply human look at one of the world's most unforgiving mountains. Highly recommended for anyone drawn to mountaineering history—or simply to stories of ambition, tragedy, and resilience at the edge of the world.",belgeselsever,1kkok13
"Almas de Arena (2024) [1:41:58] – A sea turtle conservation documentary filmed over four years in Mexico.

They do it without fame, without funding, and often without support. Just stubborn hope and love for life.  This documentary is called *Almas de Arena*. It was released for free on YouTube.

"Monalisa and the Monkey Abuse Iceberg (2025) [00:24:00] - a docu-style expose about an abuse ring hidden in plain sight Hey all —   I’ve been working on a documentary-style investigation for the past few months that uncovers a very disturbing subculture online.  At first glance, it’s just “cute monkey videos” — baby monkeys wearing diapers, being “rescued,” or bottle-fed on YouTube and Facebook. But as I dug deeper, I found a network of fake rescues, recycled fear, coded language in the comments, and even organized fetish groups profiting off the suffering of these animals.  I compiled all my findings into a video titled:   **Case File 001: Monalisa and the Monkey Abuse Iceberg.**  It premieres today, and I’d really appreciate thoughts, feedback, or even just awareness around this topic:  Not looking to farm views — just genuinely trying to bring attention to something most people scroll past without realizing what’s actually happening.

"Lights In the Shadows (2025) [01:01:40] “In the shadow of Silicon Valley’s booming technology industry, a growing number of people remain out in the cold.  Skyrocketing housing prices and an astronomical cost-of-living in America’s hub of innovation have pushed many onto the streets, straining policymakers to find solutions to a homelessness problem that directly, or indirectly, impacts everyone in the community.  Batman of San Jose and Crimson Fist work anonymously to provide a lifeline to those who sleep without shelter on San Jose’s sidewalks, camp in tents along the Guadalupe River or retreat to the subterranean darkness of the city’s storm drain tunnel system.  Lights in the Shadows follows the two superheroes as they hand out water and food to those in need, provide outreach for those who live on the margins and help Gretchen, a woman in the midst of a domestic violence crisis.  During their missions they discuss their views about what is leading to the rapidly growing homelessness crisis in their area, the common misconceptions other citizens have about the unhoused and what policymakers can, and should, be doing to help the most vulnerable in their districts.”  -From the MediaStorm Website",belgeselsever,1kicoaq

Any recommendations? (Other than the ""making of"" videos about movies, such as the ones included on Blu-rays, which I have plenty of.) My main interest is history, especially European history, but I'll take pretty much anything in English.  FYI, here are the two docs I've watched that showed some of what they were doing while filming. It's not the focus of the documentaries, just a bit of behind-the-scenes stuff here and there:  [BBC Victoria and Albert The Royal Wedding with Lucy Worsley](  [Timeline: The Untold Story Of The 1381 Peasants Revolt with Tony Robinson](  Thanks!",belgeselsever,1k9nwy5

"1948: Creation and Catastrophe (2017) - [1:25:13] Description (found in the Description to the Youtube video): Through riveting and moving personal recollections of both Palestinians and Israelis, 1948: Creation & Catastrophe reveals the shocking events of the most pivotal year in the most controversial conflict in the world. It tells the story of the establishment of Israel as seen through the eyes of the people who lived it. But rather than being a history lesson, this documentary is a primer for the present. It is simply not possible to make sense of what is happening today without an understanding of 1948. This documentary was the last chance for many of its Israeli and Palestinian characters to narrate their first-hand accounts of the creation of a state and the expulsion of a nation. Hear stories from the Israelis and Palestinians who personally lived through events in Haifa, Jaffa, Dayr Yasin, Acre, Jerusalem, Ramla, Lydda and more. These shocking and dramatic events reveal the core of what drives the conflict today.  Note from the producers: This documentary is ten years in the making. We collected dozens of stories from fighters, refugees (many still living in camps) and survivors of the war. Their stories are powerful, heart-breaking and shocking. On top of those interviews, we conducted a mountain of research (over 20,000 pages of history), painstakingly fact-checking every statement made in the documentary. Our team gathered photographs and film from archives across the globe. We retrieved copies of military orders from Israeli archives. We translated dozens of Arabic and Hebrew interviews as well as secondary documents. And we interviewed and consulted with some of the most respected historians in the field. This has been a colossal amount of work. We sincerely hope you get something out of it. Andy Trimlett & Dr. Ahlam Muhtaseb",belgeselsever,1k5ai3w

Former followers accuse them of being manipulative cult leaders, puppet masters who exert coercive control, push followers into unwanted relationships, and even pressure them to change genders. The email came with an invitation: Come see the truth for yourself.  I agreed—on the condition that I’d be investigating every allegation.

"Recommendation Request: Docs featuring a current story with good ""flashback"" archival sequences Looking for references of documentaries that feature a current story (a character doing something, a current event unfolding) that also feature substantial historical archive that is interwoven in the story.  So either a big chunk of ""flashback"" or archival history that is well interwoven into the current story.  To clarify, I'll mention what I'm not looking for.

I'm also not looking for films that are almost entirely original footage with bits and pieces of of archive. Free Solo, for example, is a great film but only features archive as context and some fairly typical old family photos.

As a tour guide in Grand Canyon National Park I’ve always been fascinated by this history and decided to make a deep dive video explaining my interpretation of how the parks developed at the turn of the 20th century.

Perhaps it run on some Discovery Channel (probably 45 min in length or so).  It was a story about an ambitious young man who really wanted to be a cop and was in love with some lady. Finally he got to be a subway cop (maybe in NY)- which is like a lower status but he did that job really well and got some medal or something for something he did. Meanwhile the lady he loved fell in love with a man that was a gangster or some mafia boss. He speaks in the documentary. I think the cop was extremely jealous and wanted to get back at the mafia guy who really didn't seem to care much for hat lady who was obviously head over heels about him).. In doing so the cop intervenes with an special operation (FBI?) that was being set up for that mafia guy for months.. I am not sure whether he was discharged for that ...   .

"Recommendation Request: Sports documentaries with verité elements Hi all, I’m working on a documentary about a really popular retired athlete who’s in recovery from addiction. The story will tell his journey to becoming a champion in his sports, his fall from grace from alcoholism and the turnaround that led him to where he is now - about to launch a new business while he figures out who he is.  The documentary will be part verité follow doc, part sit down interview to talk about the past. In researching for it, I’m trying to find some similar sports documentaries that we should be researching and watching.  Something like “The Last Dance” is a little too historical for this kind of request - and even though this athlete is considered a legend in the city he played in, he’s never had near the same kind of name recognition beyond his sport as Jordan.  So what else is out there? Any great docs that follow a sports figure through a more personalized journey with direct access to said journey? Something like Hoop Dreams but more recent?

I have searched for years now, but nothing to show for it. Here are the details I can recall:  * Both were white males in or leaning toward their middle ages * One was overweight (possibly obese) with long hair * The other was of average build, possibly bald (and would often wear a hat) * One might have been a photographer * The other could have been a scientist or wildlife expert * They used humor a lot - **lighthearted episodes** * They roamed around in a jeep in the wild (Africa likely, considering the animals they often encountered —  such as hippos, rhinos, leopards, and so on…) * Often had playful fights for comedic effect * Memorable moments: 1) The overweight person sometimes got into trouble while photographing because he was not a fast runner and wouldn't reach the safety of the jeep if he was chased by an animal 2) Once, he was admiring and photographing a bunch of flowers but pretended not to when asked by the other host (cause he would often portray himself as the macho type —  of course, for comedic purpose).

"Adam Curtis-Can't Get You Out Of My Head (2021) [1:14:16] Casually ran into this documentary, ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" by Adam Curtis. It's a fascinating deep dive into how history, politics, and culture have shaped the modern world. What makes it so compelling is the style – the entire documentary is made up of archival footage, clips from the eras he explores, and haunting music that gives it a dreamlike, almost hypnotic feel. Curtis weaves together the rise of individualism, the spread of conspiracy theories, and the hidden forces that shape our emotions, creating connections between events you wouldn’t expect. Haven't reached the end but I feel like I have a clear understanding of why the world feels so fragmented today. It’s the kind of documentary that doesn’t just tell you history – it immerses you in it.  I put only the duration of the first episode in the title to avoid scaring people off but the whole thing consists of six episodes totalling 7 hours and 40 minutes.",belgeselsever,1hm0niv

These words mark the tenants, clerks and even the owners of Chicago's last remaining Singe Room Occupancy (SRO) hotels. These small spaces are home for many at the bottom of Chicago's housing ladder. Cloaked in darkness and secrecy, these hotels are often maligned as drug dens and havens for prostitution but the people who live, work and own these hotels have never fully shared their stories.  Caged Men is a feature-length documentary which examines the disquieting stories of near-homeless Americans living on the margins and their invisibility in a largely indifferent and, at times, hostile community.

"Max/CNN “Columbia: The Final Flight”- traumatizing!!! I just binged the Max/CNN 3-part documentary on the 2003 Columbia disaster and I am floored. This is when I wish streaming services gave you the capability that TikTok to be able to comment and react at various moments so you can experience those emotions and reactions with other people!  There were at least 50 times I wanted to look around and be like “did you see that?” Or “OMG, did he really say that? This is INSANE!” And I was just alone in my room, lol.   First of all- when they showed the shuttle and the entire interior was 1970’s-era technology, and the outside was caked in broken pieces,  looking like a car you inherited from your parents from the 90’s that has 200,000 miles on it, breaks down every other day and costs more to maintain than it’s worth BY FAR. That is what that shuttle looked like, but worse, because it’s not driving down the road, it’s going into MF space and all those internal parts were much much much more f’d up than what you saw on the outside.  THEN you’re going to tell me that you have this broken ass space ship that is on it’s last legs, has been grounded like 37 times because there are cracks in the fuel line, buttons aren’t working, and you spray it with Home Depot spray insulation to bootleg the launch? Excuse me? WHAT?  The part that pissed me off most was that there were a ton of people sounding alarms and like, 1-2 people whose egos were too big to ACTUALLY respond to the threats that other people were sending up (the main guy was like “Oh Bob, he’s always so dramatic. He’s high energy, you know, so I didn’t take it seriously”). And a woman who was the “first woman to ever be approved to lead a mission” so she probably didn’t want to look like a failure so she ignored it too. Absolutely bananas.  The worst part though was the kids of the astronauts. There is one boy who was 7yos and he BEGGED his mom not to go, he sobbed every day for months, and you can see that he’s still so so so traumatized (obviously, but more than some of the others). “She was my entire world- I just wanted my mom.”   SO many amazing people, so many incredible people at NASA who took care in their jobs, and it is a handful of people too proud/stubborn/egotistical to realize that shit was broken. They needed to address some REAL issues, but no one wanted to make NASA look like it wasn’t perfect. Insane. I guess the image of the USA >>>>>> 7 people’s lives.   UGH- anyway. I’m reeling from this documentary and just wondering if anyone else saw it and has thoughts because it is haunting in a way I wasn’t prepared for. I don’t think I have felt this many emotions watching a documentary in a while.",belgeselsever,1d0yx0w

"The Life Of A Tower Climber II |  Failures At Every Level (2025) (CC) [00:49:19] This video is the follow-up to my original documentary, The Life of a Tower Climber. If you haven’t seen Part 1 yet, check it out here:   In Part 2, I take a deeper dive into the harsh realities of the tower climbing industry. This documentary highlights a system plagued by dangerous practices, driven by layers of subcontracting that effectively remove accountability for climbers’ safety.  We’ll explore the systemic issues within the industry, including:  Failing infrastructure: Climbers are often forced to work on outdated and hazardous structures. Communication breakdowns: A lack of coordination between tower owners, carriers, companies, and climbers contributes to dangerous and inefficient work environments. The role of NATE: Once an organization dedicated to protecting climbers, the National Association of Tower Erectors has seemingly shifted its focus toward protecting the interests of carriers and large businesses. Tower climbers are on the front lines, ensuring that we all stay connected, yet they remain unprotected and underrepresented. I believe it’s time for a change. Tower climbers need a collective voice, whether through a union, a nonprofit, or federal regulations.  In 2023, I was part of the effort to form the Tower Climbers Union (TCU) under the Communications Workers of America (CWA). We even chartered our first local in Phoenix, Arizona, on July 4th, 2023. Unfortunately, the effort was short-lived, primarily due to a lack of transparency and commitment from the CWA toward climbers.  Since then, I’ve taken these issues to members of Congress and will be sharing more on these developments in future projects.  Part 2 of The Life of a Tower Climber brings attention to the real cost of keeping us connected—and asks critical questions about what needs to change to protect climbers.

"🔵🟢Trying something new and we need your feedback! 🟢🔵 **So we are going to be trying something new: Theme Weeks!**  Theme weeks will be starting Sunday, and we will be announcing a theme each week that we are featuring. You will not have to post about the theme, you can absolutely continue posting as normal, but we would love if you would!  I will make a post on Sunday that we will sticky to the subreddit and it will be a theme, for example: Big Cats, The Cold War, Guitarists, Barack Obama, Animation, or Hitler. I would love to hear suggestions as well. I will ask for them every week when I make the post and would love to see what you come up with. I cannot promise that we will use what you suggest, especially the very next week but I promise to take it into consideration- especially if it seems others are interested as well. So what should we have for the first week and beyond? Please leave your suggestions in the comments!   **Also we want your opinion on new material allowed: Video Essays.**   So we sometimes get video essays posted on this subreddit but we take those down as they are not Documentaries, but sometimes they get some attention before we do. We are wondering what you think about allowing video essays? They would have to be clearly marked as such, so they are not confused with actual documentaries. The subreddit has been pretty quiet as of late, so tell us if this is something you would find interesting. We could also do a trial period and see how it goes? We do want to hear from our users though. Video essays often do not pass our rule on needing to have original footage, so what do you think? I cannot exactly describe a video essay so I cheated and here is some info AI gave on them:   >A video essay is a short film or video recording that presents an essay in a format that combines written, audio, and visual modes. Video essays can be used to educate, persuade, analyze, or critique a topic, theme, person, or thesis. They can cover a wide range of topics, including politics, music, film, pop culture, and art genres.   **So we would love to hear what you think of allowing video essays and also what your suggestion for the first theme week should be!**",belgeselsever,1e0y9iq

"AMA -  We are the filmmakers behind NETFLIX's ""The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem""  (Answering questions Friday, May 17th at 12pm EST) Hi there,  We are Giorgio Angelini and Arthur Jones, the filmmakers behind the new feature documentary on Netflix, *The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem*. ([Trailer](  Telling the story of one of the most consequential websites in history (and Reddit rival?), [4Chan.org]( the film chronicles the experience of a few early “channers” who helped to create this once thriving community for self-described shut-ins. What began as a niche website, bringing together a shared love of anime and memes—and porn...lots of porn—the site wound up becoming a powerful machine for warping reality and fomenting chaos in the real world. Now as adults, these channers look back on what they built, wondering if the genie can be put back in the bottle.  Our previous film was the Sundance and Emmy award-winning doc, *Feels Good Man*, the story of cartoonist Matt Furie and his Pepe the Frog saga.  **Ask us anything!**   **Answering questions beginning Friday May 17 at 12pm EST**  *Please don't be a troll. I mean, you can. Sure. But it's not the attention you seek. I promise. Just call your mom and tell her you love her. Much more productive.*",belgeselsever,1csxj6r

"""The Silence of Others"" (2018) [01:36:00] The Silence of Others reveals the epic struggle of victims of Spain's 40-year dictatorship under General Franco, who continue to seek justice to this day.

Optional international viewing sites can be found here:   Most people have heard of Hitler, but most people don't know what Stalin did to his people in Russia (Ukraine), what Pinochet did to his people in Chile, and not what Franco did to people in Spain - especially the latter because the government passed ""Amnesty Laws"" to forget (aka so government officials wouldn't be held culpable and accountable!).

"We want your input on changing things up! ✅❎ Hey y'all, your mod team is here and wants to know how you all would change up stuff on this subreddit? We have been thinking that maybe our posting requirements, which say that every post must have the name of the documentary, the year it was released, and the running time in the title, might be a bit restrictive. Then we also require a submission statement that is at least a couple sentences on what to expect if we watch this documentary before a post is approved. We are wondering, are all our requirements stifling engagement in the subreddit?     So what would you change? Do you think posts should have to be approved by moderators before they go out or do you think people should be able to post directly? Do you think if a post is good but does not meet all those requirements, it should be taken down? Should we skip those requirements altogether?     We also want to know what you think about the users having some input on whether posts stay or go by voting on that question, do you think you all should be able to vote someone's post away? Or vote to keep it even if it does not meet the requirements we have laid out? Do you think voting on posts is something that should be a part of the subreddit and would you take part if there was a top comment on a post that could vote on?     Last question, right now we only allow documentaries from platforms that are free. This rules out all discussion about documentaries that are on HBO, Netflix, Prime and other streaming services or even documentaries that are ones that you have to buy individually, do you like this rule or should we allow all documentaries to be posted and discussed, even though that means some people will not have access to them?   We will be doing a series of polls over the coming days asking about these things, so please look out for them but we also wanted to give you a space to just talk about the sub overall and how you would like things to be different, and we really want to hear from you. We want to make this sub into the subreddit YOU want, for the users of the sub, not the mods. So please tell us what you think!    Please keep comments respectful and centered around the topics that were asked about, thank you!",belgeselsever,1gh53p8

I think almost everyone has seen at least a couple sports documentaries so post your favorites this week and help us get theme weeks going.   Also I want to hear your suggestions for more themes! I know I asked in the other pinned post announcing this but I want you all to keep them coming. I am keeping the posts so I can look at them in the future when I am trying to pick the theme but if something is upvoted I will know that people would like to see that theme and that will influence my decision. So give more suggestions below!  **Other news:**   Remember we are now allowing video essays so long as they are clearly marked in your submission statement. Please write ""VIDEO ESSAY"" at the beginning of your submission statement so you make it very clear that it is not a documentary.

With The Land As It Lies documentary series Up River Film & Golf Company strives to capture the essence of golf courses by uniquly depicting each course to the golfing world.  Now some may wonder, why does Gamble Sands get a scary movie introduction?        1.) This introduction tells the story of someone growing up in the mid west or east coast, never before seeing Washington golf. The landscapes at Gamble Sands will blow the minds of this demographic of first timers.       2.) The dramatic terrain at Gamble Sands can only be matched with a dramatic introduction.       3.)

Reading about it on Wikipedia was certainly interesting, so I wanted to do some digging and find more info on it.  Documentaries about it <i>do<i> exist on Youtube, but all that I could find seemed to be coming at it from an outwardly religious angle, or come from a religious source, like a Christian channel or some such. There's nothing wrong with that of course, and it makes total sense for such a religious-based event, but I wanted to see if anyone here knew any documentaries that treated it ""secularly"", highlighting the stuff that led to it, the event itself, and what happened afterwards.

I've struggled to find clips, and i only vaguely remember a few scenes from each.     The first one was a 90's documentary featuring African elephants. There was a scene in this one where a baby elephant gets lost in a herd of buffalo, and is crying in distress. The mother(or one of the females from the herd) has enough, and charges into the pack and parts them like a sea to get to the baby. One unfortunate buffalo gets Yeeted int the air by a single trunk strike from this female elephant.(I;ve been dying to show this specific scene to my co-worker, to show them just how strong an elephant is with its trunk only)  The Second one was also a 90's piece, and it appeared during Big Cat week sometime in the 90's.(sorry my memory is bad, i wish i could remember more) This particular documentary is based or focused on tigers. The key things i can recall of this one was that it starts out in Siberia. At some point it shows a tiger hunting/killing a snake, a cobra if I'm not mistaken? and towards the end, it also shows another tiger hunting/killing a buffalo.

"I created a documentary about the Glencoe Massacre inspired by my Highland roadtrip [OC] Hello everyone,  As a public historian, I recently launched a documentary series about the Glencoe Massacre called “The Mountains Remember“ as part of my Odyssia 2.0 project. The idea came to me during a roadtrip through the Scottish Highlands - while driving through that majestic and melancholic valley, I felt the weight of the tragic events that unfolded there.  Through 5 episodes (originally one movie of one hour), I tell the story of how, on the freezing night of February 13, 1692, the Argyll's Regiment of Foot executed their hosts, the MacDonald of Glencoe clan, shattering the ancient Scottish law of hospitality. I explore the political, religious, and clan tensions that led to this massacre ordered by the British Crown.  For this project, I did everything myself - historical research, script writing, voice over, editing and graphics. It's truly a labor of love, though as a French, Greek and Italian person tackling Scottish history, I sometimes wrestle with Gaelic and English pronunciations - please forgive my accent as I navigate clan names and British history with passion rather than perfect pronunciation!  Here's the link to the first episode: [  If you're passionate about Scottish history or have visited Glencoe yourself, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this approach and this chapter of history.",belgeselsever,1kli3s3

"Tips I have for independent Youtube documentary makers First, I appreciate them for making videos on niche and obscure subjects you won't see on the big networks. But I see a lot of them that could benefit from a few suggestions.  It's important to have some pauses, breaks, or interludes from your dialogue. Too many amateur docs are an hour of nonstop talking. This causes ear fatigue for viewers. You can break up the monotony with some more sections of ambient footage and film score music. People need some moments to take in and digest information. The narration should have beats like a film script. Yes, it's impressive that they have accrued so much information on the topic, but that doesn't mean they need to cram it all in. Quality over quantity.  It also helps a lot to have a co-narrator, as having variety is always good, and having another voice would also reduce the ear fatigue. I've seen a couple youtubers adopt this, and it helps.  Interviews with experts adds a lot to documentaries, which understandably isn't something easy to obtain for an independent youtuber, but even Skype interviews would be a good addition. I've seen some great Youtuber made docs with skype interviews. And they don't need to be with university professors and industry elites. You've seen the hacks History Channel has put on their shows. Put on anyone with a little cred and something interesting to say.  Put in other kinds of things like some factoids. Or a trivia question, with graphics. Anything different to give the documentary some more texture.  With the selection of stock video footage available these days, nobody should still be making photo only docs. 10 years ago that was okay, but viewers expect more than a narrated slide show now. Also, don't put your name in the title of every video like someone who's name rhymes with Harry Chinner. It's tacky.  BTW: I'd love to see someone make a secular doc on Joseph Smith. His flaws and con games were far more interesting than the fiction.",belgeselsever,1epo5uz

"Recommendations on good and accurate history documentaries Hello,  The  past couple of weeks I have realised I need to educate myself more  about history. History is truth, and understanding that makes you  understand everything better imo, Through good documentaries.   In  today's landschape where there is a bit of an information overload and  together with that, politics sometimes make me wonder where the truth  really lies.  For example: Germans  always being shown as just evil people but I would like to understand  their side of the story in the world wars more. Hollywood movies often  times make them look like generic evil villains, but we are all humans  with motivations and reasons why things happen. I'm not looking for who  is right or wrong in history. I'm really looking for the most honest  straight up facts about history.  Movies  are ofcourse not the best source. I have a couple of history books but  the ones I have are mostly surface level information.  Any  recommendations for books, history documentaries or movies would be  greatly appreciated. Preferably about the past 300 years.  Thank you in advance for anyone willing to take the time to do this for me",belgeselsever,12kzbuw

They're like dusty treasure chests filled with history... but who has time to read them all?  That's why I'm experimenting with AI! Think of it like this: AI can be the director who takes those mountains of paperwork and turns them into something watchable—like a **historical docu-series on Netflix.**  **🚀 What's in the video?**  This is a prototype showing how AI can generate a **mini-documentary from raw, declassified documents**. The AI handles the visuals, voiceover, and storyline, transforming dense information into something you can actually enjoy and learn from.  **📜 Why this matters:**  AI could unlock countless hidden histories! By transforming dry documents into engaging stories, we can make these important records accessible to everyone, not just historians.  **📢 Want to Help Shape the Future of History?**  I'm building a platform that makes it easy for anyone to create and share AI-generated documentaries from public sources. If you're excited about the potential and want to be part of the early testing group, let me know!  ***TL;DR:*** *I used AI to make a prototype doc from boring government documents.

"Seeking Help to Identify a Haunting Documentary about War Crimes - Journalist Investigates WWII and Serbian Atrocities Hello everyone,  I've been trying to find a documentary that has left a lasting impact on me, and I'm hoping this community might be able to help. It aired on SBS in Australia around 2016-2018. The documentary is centered on a British journalist's investigation into two specific photographs:  1. A photo of Serbian or Bosnian armed men, possibly militia or military, standing over the bodies of women and children. 2. A photo of a German WWII officer with a clipboard, overseeing a mass grave where a bulldozer is pushing bodies into the grave.  The journalist delves deep into the histories behind these photographs, eventually tracking down the men in the first photo and the German officer in the second. The interviews explore how they ended up in those situations and the human nature aspect of their actions.  This documentary is unique in its focus on the investigation of specific historical photographs and the stories behind them. Any information about this documentary, its title, director, or any leads on how to find it would be immensely appreciated. It's a piece that has haunted me for years, and I'm earnestly looking to revisit its profound narrative.  Thank you all in advance for your help!",belgeselsever,1aenh9f

"I created a documentary about the Glencoe Massacre inspired by my Highland roadtrip [OC] Hello everyone,  As a public historian, I recently launched a documentary series about the Glencoe Massacre called “The Mountains Remember“ as part of my Odyssia 2.0 project. The idea came to me during a roadtrip through the Scottish Highlands - while driving through that majestic and melancholic valley, I felt the weight of the tragic events that unfolded there.  Through 5 episodes (originally one movie of one hour), I tell the story of how, on the freezing night of February 13, 1692, the Argyll's Regiment of Foot executed their hosts, the MacDonald of Glencoe clan, shattering the ancient Scottish law of hospitality. I explore the political, religious, and clan tensions that led to this massacre ordered by the British Crown.  For this project, I did everything myself - historical research, script writing, voice over, editing and graphics. It's truly a labor of love, though as a French, Greek and Italian person tackling Scottish history, I sometimes wrestle with Gaelic and English pronunciations - please forgive my accent as I navigate clan names and British history with passion rather than perfect pronunciation!  Here's the link to the first episode: [  If you're passionate about Scottish history or have visited Glencoe yourself, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this approach and this chapter of history.",belgeselsever,1kli46s

Some choice moments to jog your memories are:  The cameraman being in the back of a small hot hatch with an overly confident teenager overtaking on single carriage ways into oncoming traffic, fitting through gaps saying 'I can make that...'  Following the young lad back to his mums to prepare for 'a meet'. This involved him changing his t-shirt, spraying some deodarant. After throwing his T-shirt on the floor he snorts tells the film maker 'mum will clean it'.   It also followed a young lady who went to the meet with hopes to either feature in Fast Car magazine or to be an aspriign model. I can't remember.   I would really like to watch it again. I remember it being very funny and expertly misleading for the subjects of the film who would no doubt wince if they were to watch it back today.   Anyone???   Cheers!",belgeselsever,lz9j2k

What impact do they have on relationships?     ‘Unmasking the Divide’     I’m looking for participants to be part of a documentary that I will be filming this summer as my final submission for my MA in Filmmaking.     Logline:     *What happens when belief in conspiracy theories comes at the cost of personal relationships? This documentary investigates the psychological and social forces behind conspiratorial thinking, speaking to both those who feel they’ve lost loved ones and the believers themselves to uncover how these ideas take hold—and whether bridges can be rebuilt.*     This is not a hit piece or a platform for conspiracy theories, it is an unbiased reflection on the relationships that have been fractured by personal beliefs. I am looking for people of any age who may have lost contact/grown apart from a friend or family member due to their beliefs in conspiracy theories. I am also looking for conspiracy theorists/truth seekers/alternative thinkers who have had friends or family distance themselves due to your beliefs.     The aim will be to retain anonymity so that people are able to speak openly and honestly about their experiences.     Please email me at [unmaskingthedivide@gmail.com](mailto:unmaskingthedivide@gmail.com) if you would like any more information or would like to have a chat about your experience.     Please feel free to share",belgeselsever,1jjfxte

The mother states Mo went off with his uncle but never explains why he went. Mo himself then states when he was at his uncles prior to his trafficking, a women came round and said he would be shipped off to Europe.  Then when they interviewed the aunt, she basically doesn't know why he was brought over but has the same surname ""Farah"".  It sounds like, when his dad died and the village was bombed etc the mother made the decision to sell him off in exchange for some much needed funds to get them out of the situation they where in. Once sold off the uncle then used a relatives child passport with the name ""Mo Farah"" to have him sent to England where he would then be put to work. Once social services starting poking around the ""aunt"" took him in so the truth wasn't investigated further.  Anyone thinking the same here? It just doesn't add up to me.

"Help find this documentary, please There was this really good human evolution documentary that featured Neanderthals (I'm sure) Cro-Magnons (I'm pretty sure), and Homo Sapiens Idaltu (I'm not so sure) that I watched with my family years ago on Netflix. It was a lot like Walking With Cavemen in the sense that it followed troupes of early man and narrated their stories instead of having paleontologists talk with bones in their hands. The Neanderthals' faces looked Asian (which actually makes sense to me) and the special effects were crazy good. For its time, I think it was a pretty scientifically current documentary. I remember it being more informative than the BBC version of Walking With Cavemen. Anyways, if you could help me find it, that would be great. It was the best human evolution documentary I ever watched. I think it was a series but I'm not sure. I don't know for sure whether or not it was narrated by an American or a Brit, but I wanna say it was narrated by a British person. I think in the story, the Cro-Magnons met the Homo Sapiens Idaltu while travelling.",belgeselsever,7rtwsb

"I’m digging up a dead body this June and I need help documenting it. My name is Henry Morton and I am a journalism student at the University of Missouri. I am reaching out to this community because I need help. In my home town in Salem, Illinois I have spearheaded and organized the effort to exhume the grave of an unidentified person killed in a train wreck in 1971. The people I’m working with and I are doing this to collect a DNA sample from the persons remains to use to hopefully find their family. I’m working on this project in collaboration with the local government, a few small businesses, and an organization called the DNA Doe Project. The DNA Doe Project is a charitable organization whose entire mission is to identify John and Jane Does through the use of DNA sampling and genealogical databases. Together we are all working to hopefully identify this person and bring closure to their family. The project is going great and the is exhumation is scheduled for mid-June. The problem is I want to make a documentary about the whole thing and I need help doing it. I’ve never made a full documentary before and I know if I did it with Mizzou students it would turn out fairly amateur. The thing is I know this is a great story and an important cause to raise awareness about and it deserves a professional job. That’s why I’m reaching out to you all. I wanted to see if anyone in this community is interested in perhaps getting on board with this project and working on it with me. I don’t have that much money to pay anyone but I do have access to equipment. As a Mizzou Journalism student I can rent out all the gear needed to create a film. So if you’re interested in making this with me. Please let me know in the comments or send me a message. You can also reach me at my email: shelby9866@gmail.com  Also here’s a news article about the project if anyone isn’t sure if this is legit or not: [article](

DJI mic 2 local track is blank. I recorded this interview with both a live track into my camera which ended up being blank and a locally recorded track on the dji mic 2. When I go into the editor I saw the audio was not there. I assume the backup track would have recorded it. Nope 1 second of audio at the start and then it cuts to silence. Not sure why this would happen on the local track. And no I was not wearing headphones like I should have. This has never happened before.

"Is observational filmmaking dead? I re-watched Primary recently — the groundbreaking 1960 film that followed JFK and rival Hubert Humphrey on the campaign trail. I was struck not just by the access, but by the trust between subject and filmmaker.  Very little narration. No spin. Just presence, patience, and proximity.  In an age of performative politics, hyper-edited docs, and post-truth narratives, that kind of filmmaking feels almost radical — and its disappearance, a real loss.",belgeselsever,1k60uka
"Help me stay anonymous TLDR: Making a controversial documentary, how to stay anonymous?  For the last few months I have been researching for a documentary that explains direct connections between the ruling party of my country and the street mafia of our capital city, from the party members ordering kills to directly financing the mafia. This was all happening in the 90s and early 2000s, however there are still many connections that are still shown to this day, only nobody knows about it because at the time when it was at its peak (90s/00s) it was top secret. My theory is that the remaining mafia members are still being used by the same party to basically destroy the reputation of any opposition with a chance of beating them. There's more but this is the extremely short version.  For obvious reasons, I'm going to disappear for a while and stay anonymous after it's out and I guarantee complete anonimity to everyone interviewed/involved in any way. I'm planning to release it before our next election which is in about 3 years.  So my question is: How do I release it? Should I just put it on YouTube and hope the algorithm pushes it to the right people? (It's a small country and it shouldn't be very hard for that to happen) Can't have any production house or anything behind it because then I'll jeopardize my anonimity.   Also how do I stay completely anonymous? I was talking to people from the archive of our national television over some footage from 2002. but changed my mind on it because if I use it someone will definitely be able to track it back to me, because this stuff only exists in their archive and they keep track of who might use it.  At the beginning I figured there's time to think about how to get publicity or whatever, but as time passes and this thing becomes so much bigger that question keeps bothering me more and more everyday.",belgeselsever,1kaz794
"I want to film a documentary about living with Autism from my POV. Not sure where to start... Yeah I know that there are a lot of Autism Docs already out there, but I feel like each one is unique. Not everyone on the spectrum is the same, so everyone's ideas, thoughts, life experiences, and voice are all different.  I have tried writing a script, realized that scripts are pretty useless for documentaries, and then realized I have no idea how to even document this whole thing.  I want to talk about my Special Interests, and how they have shaped my life, for good and bad, and how they have made me who I am today. I want to talk about how my Autism has affected my life up until this point, thr hurdles I have overcome, and the goals I have in the future. I also want to talk about the reality of living with mental illness and a disability.  I don't want to just interview myself, but at the same time, I am unsure what exactly to film.

"Rec’s for indie Documentary camera package I’m in the early stages of developing a documentary with a small team, and it’s looking like I might take on the role of DP. Most of my background is in post (over a decade), but I started out as a videographer and have shot a few short shoestring docs over the years, so it makes sense I’d step into this role, at least for now.  There are still more things uncertain than not, and it may not get past pre production, but if everything comes together, we should have a semi-decent budget.  Not huge, but enough to take some of the financial pressure off.  In addition to our own money, maybe 10-20k or so from some potential investors 🤞.  I’m starting to research camera package options and would love some input.  My first instinct was to rent a Blackmagic Pocket 6K with some kind of shoulder rig or cage setup. I like its compact size, strong image quality, and (most importantly) its price but I’m definitely open to suggestions.  The style will be pretty vérité heavy, mostly fly-on-the-wall. We’ll be following a running group, so lots of movement, long takes, and generally trying to be a fly on the wall in their lives. Mobility and comfort will be key. The crew will likely be tiny—me (as DP), a sound recordist, and the director. There will probably be times I’ll have to cover sound myself, too.  So with all that in mind: - What are your favorite lightweight, low-profile camera rigs for vérité-style doc shooting? - For those who’ve worked in similar styles—are cine lenses actually worth the investment over still lenses in this kind of setting? Is the difference really noticeable? - If I have to end up covering sound myself in certain instances, what would be the best way for me to do that and what mics would be best?  Would appreciate any insights, anecdotes, or gear recommendations—thanks in advance!",belgeselsever,1k93kzo

A little bit about me: I’ve been working in filmmaking for about 5-6 years now, I’ve done a lot of commercial work with very little narrative work.

"Tierra de Nubes: A Documentary Film on Traditions and Contemporary Art — We’d Love Your Feedback! We’re launching Tierra de Nubes (Land of Clouds) — a Kickstarter project born in Oaxaca, Mexico.  At its heart is a unique dialogue between nature and people, earth and sky. Forms emerge through collaboration, where traditional techniques and contemporary art intertwine, opening new possibilities for co-creation.  The centerpiece of the project will be a documentary film — a vivid and profound story of the creative process, of clay as a unifying force, and of the people who share their personal stories, feelings, and experiences.  The project will culminate in an exhibition (16 sculptures and 8 mixed-media paintings).

We're aware of a lot, if not most, of the process involved, but now we're a little stuck on the script writing and both the fortmat and software to use.  Looking at Celtx, I really like their multi-column AV script, but Celtx has a lot of hate around it. I also think it's a bit pricy. Looking at Final Draft I really like it, but it doesn't have the multi-column support that I feel is perfect for documentary.

"A Desperate Plea from a Silenced Mother — 12 Years of Parental Alienation My name is Noella, and for the past 12 years, I’ve been living every parent’s worst nightmare: being completely cut out of my child’s life—not by the courts, not by choice—but through lies, manipulation, and a system that refused to protect my bond with my son.  Braidon was in my custody until he was 5. Even during our divorce, I didn’t fight for full custody—I fought for equal parenting. I believed my son deserved both of us, even though his father and I were separating. The court granted us alternating years due to long distance. But after Braidon’s first year with his father, he never came back.  Instead, I was fed excuse after excuse—canceled flights, bad weather, no-shows. Then suddenly, the communication stopped. I later found out Ryan had taken Braidon to Florida and hidden him—during my designated year. When I went there with a court order and the police, I was told it was a “civil matter.” No help. No justice. No recourse.  Eventually, I got one call. One moment. And in that moment, my six-year-old son told me he couldn’t come see me—because his father said I’d take him away and he’d never see his dad again.  That broke something inside me. Because not only was my child taken… he was made to fear me.  Since then, I’ve missed everything. Birthdays. Graduations. First dances. All of it. I’ve fought to be heard—filing for contempt, calling attorneys, contacting media outlets, pleading with shows like yours. I’ve sent messages to Dr. Phil for years. This isn’t about attention—it’s about being a mother. It’s about getting the chance to reconnect before it’s too late.  I am not unstable. I am not a danger. I’m a heartbroken mother who has been vilified, silenced, and erased—fighting for the chance to be in my son’s life again.  Please help me tell my story. Please help me reach my son.  This is more than a cry for help—this is my last hope.  Sincerely, Noella",belgeselsever,1kiupdk

"10 Must-Watch Documentaries That Will Change Your Life Hey fellow documentary enthusiasts,    I wanted to share a list of documentaries that have deeply inspired me and shaped my journey as a filmmaker. As someone who’s recently completed a documentary about my mother’s 50-year career with American Airlines, I know the profound impact a well-told documentary can have. Here are 10 documentaries that have left a lasting impression on me, and I believe they’ll do the same for you:    1. **The Stories We Tell** by Sarah Polley  Sarah Polley’s deeply personal documentary explores family secrets and the narratives we build around them. This meta-documentary blends home videos, interviews, and reenactments to reveal the complexity of memory and truth. Polley’s exploration of identity and family moved me to tears and has profoundly influenced my own work.  2. **Dark Days** by Marc Singer  Marc Singer’s “Dark Days” offers an intimate look at a community living in an abandoned New York City train tunnel. Made on a zero budget, Singer’s commitment to authenticity and storytelling shines through. His hands-on approach and the resilience of the tunnel dwellers make this a powerful and unforgettable film.  3. **Grey Gardens** by Albert and David Maysles  This classic documentary captures the eccentric lives of Big Edie and Little Edie, mother and daughter living in a decaying mansion. Their codependent relationship is both beautiful and tragic, showcasing the complexities of familial love. “Grey Gardens” changed my perspective on what documentaries can achieve emotionally.  4. **Won’t You Be My Neighbor?** by Morgan Neville  Morgan Neville’s tribute to Fred Rogers is a heartwarming and inspiring look at the life of a man dedicated to kindness and empathy. Fred Rogers’ legacy and his commitment to public broadcasting are beautifully portrayed, making this documentary a feel-good must-watch.  5. **Daughters** by Natalie Ray and Angela Patton  “Daughters” follows young girls preparing for a “Daddy Daughter Dance” with their incarcerated fathers. The film highlights the emotional toll of separation and the transformative potential of reconnecting with loved ones. It’s a poignant reminder of the resilience of family bonds.  6. **Matt Shepard Is a Friend of Mine** by Michele Josue  This documentary explores the life and tragic death of Matthew Shepard through the eyes of his friends and family. Michele Josue’s personal connection to Shepard adds a layer of intimacy and heartbreak, making it a deeply moving film about love, loss, and the fight against hate.  7. **Bowling for Columbine** by Michael Moore  Michael Moore’s provocative documentary on gun violence and the Columbine High School massacre is a powerful call to action. Moore’s fearless approach and the film’s success demonstrated the potential for documentaries to be both impactful and commercially successful.  8. **Grizzly Man** by Werner Herzog  Werner Herzog’s “Grizzly Man” delves into the life and tragic death of Timothy Treadwell, who lived among grizzly bears in Alaska. Herzog’s philosophical narration and Treadwell’s compelling footage create a thought-provoking meditation on the human relationship with nature.  9. **Unzipped** by Douglas Keeve  “Unzipped” offers a behind-the-scenes look at fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi’s creative process. This intimate and entertaining documentary showcases the passion and drive that fuel creativity, making it a delightful watch for anyone interested in fashion and individuality.  10. **All That Breathes** by Shaunak Sen  This captivating documentary follows two brothers who run a bird hospital in Delhi, caring for kites affected by urban pollution. Their dedication and quiet love for the birds are deeply moving, highlighting the interconnectedness of all living things.    **Bonus: Waiting for Guffman**    Although not a traditional documentary, “Waiting for Guffman” is a hilarious mockumentary that parodies community theater and the documentary form itself. Directed by Christopher Guest, this film is a loving satire filled with memorable performances and laugh-out-loud moments.

"how to find a subject for your first doc Hi, I've worked as an editor for 2 docs now and have a background in film production. After editing some documentaries I came to the conclusion that I have the production background to produce my own using my equipment, but the issue for me is that I don't have a subject in mind to make a documentary about. For the documentary filmmakers on here, how did you decide on the topic of your documentary? Was it a subject you've always been interested in or a topic that was introduced to you and you pursued it? For the two I worked on, one was a personal story in regards to the subject's personal life story, and the other a story about a group of people who are involved in a creative endeavor together.  To solve this dilemma, I could look for groups locally that interest me and query the level of interest around producing a doc on them, or look for a person whose life I could portray in a documentary that would be interesting as a subject piece.   Another approach I could take is look at subjects that interest me and see if i could make something around that topic using resources available. So for example, I've always loved standup comedy. I could approach this subject by finding out all the open mics near me and making a doc about the stand up comedy scene here filming local standup, interviews with owners, comics, and audiences about their experiences here and what makes it unique or different.  For example, one of the previous projects involved music so I could see if I could find a local musician or band and approach them to see if they would be interested in having a documentary on them.  I'm a pretty introverted person, but i have production experience shooting interviews and run and gun handheld as well. Anyways, curious to hear how other filmmakers here decided on their subject matter and how they began their project.",belgeselsever,1his0kj
"Sex tapes as documentary I'm currently in a documentary film class where we've been watching documentaries which I guess are considered more avant-garde and break away from the ""standard"" documentary style of objective commentary (some of the documentaries we watched have no commentary at all). So this is all to say, if someone makes an amateur sex tape, where there's real sex between two real people, no script or acting of any kind like in porn, would this be a documentary?

"Editing best practice Hi! I’m wrapping up the filming of my first doc and wanted to get some tips from industry veterans about editing. I’m the producer and I work well with the director. However, when it comes to story boarding the final doc, we have some differences of opinion. I wanted to make the hook in the first two minutes - this is about a mother and son pair who didn’t connect when the son was a baby. We show this in an interview format in the first scene.  But the director wants the audience to follow the 10 year old boy home from school, and then he goes to an event to meet his mom, and the dynamic reveals itself. This is definitely the more cinematic route to go. The director wants to save the hook toward the end, and give everyone a big concluding thesis. My concern is that people get bored with features so easily. If it’s not clear in the first 2 min what the hook is, then they may not make it. So the question I have for this group is: how do you balance the need for authentic and cinematic storytelling, to the structural need of having a hook or a punchline every few minutes to keep the audience’s attention?",belgeselsever,1hnbt86

"Student documentary filmmaker looking for advice Hi there,     I'm a student filmmaker looking for some advice.     I'm about to start a documentary project following a cultural minority group as they go through the process of applying for cultural heritage status. My concern with this project is that the actual driving factor of the plot, trying to get this status, doesn't have a lot to ""see"" as it's mainly admin and emails. I'm able to do interviews with them, show parts of their lives and what this would mean to them, but I'm worried this won't be enough to give the film the drive I was hoping for.     Any advice would be appreciated!     Thank you.",belgeselsever,1flfqm1

"Seeking Guidance: My First Doc, Capturing Dakar's ""Gravel Queens"" (Direct Cinema, Tripod-Focused) Salam everyone! My name is Hussein Dembel Sow, and I'm a 38-year-old filmmaker from Dakar, Senegal. I've always been captivated by stories that often go untold, the quiet struggles and triumphs that make up the fabric of a community. Now, I'm finally taking the leap to tell one of those stories – I'm making my first documentary.  **The Story: The ""Gravel Queens"" of Dakar**   Dakar is a city in perpetual motion, with construction booming everywhere you look. Amidst the dust and clamor, a group of remarkable women, the ""Tisseuses de Pierres"" (Gravel Queens), have carved out their own space. They collect and meticulously sort leftover construction materials – what others discard – transforming it into a source of income and quiet strength. This article offers a glimpse into their world: [  **My Vision - Direct Cinema, Reimagined:**  * **Truth Through Observation:** I'm drawn to the power of direct cinema, to let the reality of their lives unfold naturally without heavy narration or manipulation. * **A Quieter Intimacy:** However, I want to avoid the frenetic, handheld style often associated with direct cinema. I'm picturing a more composed approach, similar in spirit to ""Some Kind of Heaven,"" where the camera, often on a tripod, observes with a quiet respect, allowing moments to breathe. I believe this will mirror the dignity of the women's labor.  **Where I Need Your Wisdom:**  1. **Finding My Visual Compass:** Can you recommend documentaries that successfully marry direct cinema with a more considered, tripod-heavy approach? Films that showcase how to create visual interest without relying on constant camera movement? 2. **Gear for Dakar:** I need advice on selecting a camera and lens kit. Key factors:    * **Image Quality:** I'm aiming for a cinematic look, even with limited resources.    * **Low-Light Capabilities:** Some scenes might take place in dimly lit areas.    * **Durability:** Dakar's dusty environment demands gear that can handle tough conditions. 3. **Mastering the Tripod:** What techniques can I employ to ensure my film is visually compelling while shooting primarily on a tripod? How can I use composition, framing, and subtle camera movements to create dynamism within stillness? 4. **Building Trust, Capturing Authenticity:** The women I'll be filming are not actors. They are mothers, workers, individuals with their own stories. What advice do you have for a first-time filmmaker on gaining their trust and capturing authentic moments of their lives?  I'm incredibly passionate about sharing the stories of these resilient women. Any guidance you can offer would be immensely appreciated. I want to learn from your experiences and do this project justice.  **Baax na lool!** (Thank you in Wolof)  * Hussein Dembel Sow",belgeselsever,1d4hzec

Making a documentary on a group I work for. Apologies for the vague title as I'm not sure how to phrase this.  I've been volounteering for an outdoor education organisation for a few years. Earlier this year there was a significant accident that is publicly known that two people were injured and recovery and rebuilding work is currently underway. I have previously made social media content for the organisation and am currently thinking about making a short documentary on the incident. I have not yet been in contact with management about this idea as i thought i would come here first. The question I would like to ask is that if i do end up producing the documentary could i face possible allienation from the organisation and be seen more as a outside agent or someone trying to represent a complex group. If anyone has any advice on this situation it would be greatly appreiated.,belgeselsever,1hjqras

"A question about grant funding Hi everyone, I have a question about grant funding for indie docs!      I'll begin shooting for my indie doc in the next couple of months. In the meanwhile, I'm also applying for grant funding, but decisions will come during/after the shoot. The shoot dates themselves aren't flexible because of the action I want to cover.       So at the moment we're shoestringing it, with most of the crew volunteering their time and skills because they love the story and with the understanding that if/when grant funding comes in, I'd be sharing a portion of it with them. I know of another director who did this when they got funding after having shot a bunch of their film (for context, their funding came in from several of the well known funds incl. DocSociety, Catapult, Chicken and Egg etc) and feel like it could work, but the indie producer I'm working with wasn't sure how.      I've reached out to the director to understand how they were able to use their funds this way, but also wanted to ask here:      1. How do you make a budget for a grant application when the shoot you're budgeting for would have already happened before they decide and you're basically compensating people retrospectively?      2. Are grants happy for funds to be used in this retrospective way?      Would hugely appreciate any advice and tips on this.      Thank you very much!",belgeselsever,1gk69p2

"Creating a Family Doc With Zero Experience I am not a filmmaker and have zero experience in this field, so please let me know if I'm biting off more than I can chew. Last week we celebrated what would have been my grandmother's 95th birthday and I was a little sad because I noticed I had begun to forget details about her life and/or things started getting fuzzy. My grandmother was a very powerful presence in my life and the thought of her slipping away didn't sit well with me. I decided that I wanted to chronicle not just my experience with her, but my cousins and her surviving children (my mom and aunt) as well. I have been correlating interview questions to ask and will be creating a schedule to conduct the interviews starting some time next year. The problem is:  1. I have ZERO experience in creating films 2. I don't know what equipment I'll need 3. I'm broke and on a very fixed budget  This ""documentary"" would not be for public consumption, per se. It would be moreso a gift for our family to keep my grandmother's memory alive, so I don't think I need the highest quality equipment. In the same vein I don't want it to look like a 7th grade project. Can anyone steer me in the right direction: what type of camera should I shoot on? What should be my first steps? Do I need lighting equipment for the interviews? What's a good editing software for newbs? Etc?  Thanks in advance!",belgeselsever,1g99vu9

"Can someone please help me with 1st documentary, I really need advice and it is very time sensitive, I'm freaking out and have wasted my precious time. Me and my father need to sell our dream home that he built and my childhood home after 19 years of living there and its my last connection to my mother who passed. I need to leave as quickly as possible because of debt that is very rapidly threatening to lose the house and ruin our lives.   I don't have the slightest clue on how to shoot or edit and my only experience is capcut on tiktok. I have thought about this for over 6 months. I have an outline of a script. I have some footage of things but I don't even know if any of it is very useable. I don't have clue on how to actually do this and have just been daydreaming on how I need to do this and how it could be great art and help me grieve and move on. If I don't do this I feel like I will regret it for the rest of my life but at the same time if I do it and it is terrible I don't know if I will be able to forgive myself for that either.   I have put immense pressure on myself and this has stopped me from working on it combined with my terrible work ethic. I also just generally don't know how much to add, like in the beginning its just about the house and my memories there, then it turned into like my whole life and then it turned into like my struggle with mental health and like philosophy and now I feel like its impossibly too broad and I don't know how much to say or how to say it all. I feel like it will be pretentious and generally just garbage and unwatchable. I know that since this is my 1st time that the chances are that more than likely it wont be great, I don't know, I just wish it would actually be watchable and able to hold someone's attention.   All I have is my old Samsung phone and a laptop and haven't even decided what editing software to use. I have no money for equipment. I have a tripod but no phone clip for it.     The whole thing will be me just basically monologuing over footage like a YouTube video type thing like there won't be interviews or actual scenes or anything.     I'm really struggling with:  How to make it an effective and concise story without too much droning on and on  How to edit footage to keep viewers attention like how long should one shot be how do I, I don't even know  AUDIO  my Samsung when playing back audio is very quiet at lower volumes I mean it is fine at middle but, can I like enter into a DAW to some how boost it? Do video editing software do that?  I basically need to record the script reading monologue all in one go, if I have to cut it the volumes wont be consistent and will have like a buzzing noise between each clip.   This also makes it hard to edit around and how to actually record the audio like effectively with leaving gaps for footage in certain places etc     I'm sure these problems would resolve themselves if I actually worked on it but now the whole thing is so stressful I have an aversion to it.     I don't know any advice is appreciated.",belgeselsever,1ffoc1x

"Advice/thoughts on cameras gear to use for basic documentary-style interviews? Hey All,  So, let me save the groans now...I work in film production and have been since 2007.  I used to do lots of videography/editing on basic projects, but have long since transitioned to film/TV production, sold all of my old gear, and other than photography and video as a hobby, haven't really had hands on videography experience in about 10 years.  However I was recently contacted by a friend who is a Public Defender,  who needs a 10 minute doc-style video (interviews + b-roll + edit, basic stuff) done for a client for sentencing to show their life story.  I've signed on to help him out, and I want to dust off the cobwebs and deliver something basic, but polished and nice.  The shoot is all planned, interviews are lined up, schedule is in place.  Now I just have to shoot it (the editing I'm comfortable with).  I'm a single-man crew, and expected to provide all equipment.  Based on the gear list below, what are the groups thoughts on what to use?  I will do each interview as a basic two-camera setup, static, one wide off-axis, and one MCU/CU closer to eye-line.  I'm trying not to buy anything more equipment than what is needed (or at all), so any thoughts welcome.  GEAR LIST:  Canon 5D Mark II  w/ 50 MM 1.8 Lens and Canon EF 70-200 L II  RICOH GR III (which I know shoots video, but have never used, was thinking to use this for static wides)  Iphone 15 Pro Max (was thinking of using this for the wide of the frontal, but would make it a medium to stay out of other camera, use Filmin Pro for manual settings, etc)  INSTA 360 Ace Pro (again, could use for wides)  DJI Mini 4 Pro (if I can swing it, I'll get some nice aerials of the defendants neighborhood, etc)  AUDIO:  I'll record audio separately, and use on camera mics for reference/scratch/sync  I have some mics that I use for audio recording/podcasting, but they are condenser mics that would need to be close to subject, so would be in shot.  I have a rhode shotgun to mount on top of 5D hotshoe  I have a zoom H4N circa 2012, but maybe it still holds up?  I'm thinking I'll need a lab os some sort, any good recs?

"Fandom documentary question I’ve been kicking around the idea of making a short documentary about a particular fandom that I’m in. I want to explore why it has such a grip on fans and what impact being in the fandom has had on their lives. My idea is to weave the history of the book/show in with interviews with creators in the fandom (fic writers, YouTubers, artists, etc) and stories from fans themselves. I’m thinking of collecting that last bit by asking for submissions of videos, audio recordings, and letters/emails from fans to be include in the  film. Possibly also interviewing experts on the psychology behind fandoms.   I’ve not made a film  before nor have I been involved in the making of one. It’s just an idea that won’t go away, and I like the challenge. Definitely a passion project that might only ever see the light of day on my non-monetized YouTube channel.

"Intetesting idea involving the largest amateur fireworks show in North America. Hello, Reddit!  For the last two decades, I have been involved in the largest amateur fireworks display in North America, maybe even the world.   I'm very aware that this statement could be false, however, I've done my research and I have not yet found anything else out there that can compare. Honestly, I'd willingly eat crow if you can prove that incorrect, but nevertheless, I believe that this slice of small town America is worth documenting, and am looking for anyone willing to take on the challenge.  I (31M) am the son of a bit of a nut case.  My father (64M) and I grew up in the same tiny town (same house, even) in the exact middle of nowhere, Kansas. Every 4th of July, he and I, along with a small team of volunteers, light up the skies with a fireworks display unlike any other on Earth. We use consumer grade fireworks (class C) only, meaning that anybody could do this if they had the means and determination. It's just that nobody else has ever tried.  Our team of 24 volunteers, plus my father and I, orchestrate a well planned out display that lasts 2 - 3 times longer than your average professional show (15 - 30 minutes) of constant fireworks, lasting over an hour. The entire show is set to music, each firework is lit by hand, and in an order carefully selected over months of advanced planning.  Our show is funded by the proceeds generated by a fireworks stand that we run our of my parent's garage only four days a year (July 1 - 4). We've operated the stand ourselves, along side of the help of local youth (who are paid generously for their labor) since 2008. Our show was privately funded before the stand was established.  We do not do this for profit. In fact, I would say that most years we lose money. Why? Well, like I said, my dad is a nut. But, he loves fireworks, he loves his country, and he also loves sharing it all with his neighbors and small community (~600 people). However, he is getting a bit too old for all of the efforts involved. He's set 2026 as the last year running the stand, and 2027 as the last show ever (our county's monumental anniversary of 250 years). I want nothing more than to have as much of this work documented as possible.  Anything worth filming would happen April through the first week of July. If any of this sounds interesting, please send me a message. I'm happy to provide what video we have of past displays, as well as any other details you might need.",belgeselsever,1dw6jqx

Mainly run and gun documentary work, but also corporate gigs, branded content etc. No intention of doing big commercials/narrative with my own person rig. Mainly for smaller single shooter projects.      With the FX6, I'm looking at the new DJI RS4 Pro with the lidar autofocus attachment to weigh up against the built in gimbal on the 4D. Obviously there's the disadvantage of having to mount and unmount to the gimbal, but the 4D has the disadvantage of weighing slightly more for handheld shooting all day (although I would look at the flex to combat this issue if I went with the 4D).      Would love opinions as obviously it's a bit of a commitment to an entire ecosystem to a certain extent (and quite a large financial commitment too of course). If they did a 4D where the chicken head was removeable and you could mount the sensor directly back onto the body, that would be a literal dream come true for what I'm after, so I don't know if anyone has heard about anything like that coming later down the line that I should hold off for?",belgeselsever,1dgdp00

"How to pitch a documentary idea for the right documentarist? I am not a filmmaker, I wish I was. I tried to absorb and study as many cultures and religions as I can and the one that fascinated me the most is the Cypriot one. I watched a DW documentary talking about marriage, sexuality, and feminism and it was impressive how they took 4 countries for their case study. Personally no culture, country, or religion mastered the art of family and society as much as Greek Cypriots did after the war.  * Once proposed and the relationship between the couple becomes official, they move in with the WOMAN's family. (the modern version has the couple moving in a house near the WOMAN's family in the same village) => This limits the violence against women rates and provides a more stable initial bases for the relationship * The kids are brought up by the mother's parents since school ends around 1p.m which provides a more protective environment for the child since both parents are working * The sole inheritor of the family's house is the eldest daughter since in most cases the parents help build the eldest daughter's house above their house.  This provides both financial and physical safety for the woman and child which are the bases of a healthy society. Hence even though they went through war and tough times most of this generation are well educated and established in their society.

"Any suggestions/tips on filming locations? Hello, so I am just getting started and this has been one of my biggest struggles.  Library was my first idea. I am just a bit worried because the first time I tried that when I made my first student doc, I was told no and it ruined my movie. I also tried a restaurant and the sound was so bad! Blasting Katy Perry. I realized the travel shows must get them to turn off the music. My final project was horrifically embarrassing.   Anyways, I think I will just book a study room and not tell them my plan (sorry public libraries ILY but I am desperate.) I don't have a card in my current city yet, but it doesn't say I need one.  So that is fine, but now I have my first participant and they said nights are better. So that means no library. I thought about a public park or well lit college campus (they live near both.) I am about to buy a portable light so I think I \*could\* film it outside but I think just outside in the dark would look crazy, right? Out of curiosity, what about parks during the day? I feel like that looks normal enough. I would be worried about sound but I do have a lav mic.  Some of my participants are in NYC. I am not used to the city so this worries me. They may also want to do night, so I think I may just suck it up and [rent a dedicated filming room]( for $40/hour :(  If anyone has tips or other suggestions please let me know!",belgeselsever,1che3gc

"Wich camera should I buy? Qual câmera devo comprar? Hello everyone, I'm new to the community and I've been really interested in cameras recently.  I'm a Journalism student and I'm going into my 7th semester (9 in total, I'll finish in 2026.1) and in this last semester of 2024 I had contact with the documentary subject (I've already had contact with the theoretical and practical subjects of photography/photojournalism). I was delighted with this feeling of doing something with the camera on my cell phone (I'm currently producing a mini doc to finish the subject), but I feel like I want more, even to do my final course work and to work in the future.  From that, I decided that I would like to buy a professional camera that I can use to take photos and make videos in good and high quality. However, even though I know the basic settings and some camera specifications from college, I don't know which model to choose to take with me for a long time and with good quality.  So, I'm asking for help from you in the community to help me and recommend some cameras for this challenge of mine.   I talked to my father and I will be able to get some financial help from him, so please suggest cameras with lenses or lenses without lenses of various prices, formats, sensors, apertures and quality. So it could be the one with the best cost-benefit ratio up to prices close to 1,5k dollars.  - Also, what is the job market like in documentary film? Is it worth it?  //  Olá a todos e todas, sou novo na comunidade e estou me interessando bastante por câmeras recentemente.  Sou estudante de Jornalismo e estou indo para o 7 período (9 no total, finalizo em 2026.1) e nesse último semestre de 2024 tive contato com a disciplina de documentário (já tive contato com as matérias teóricas e práticas de fotografia/fotojornalismo). Eu fiquei encantado com esse sentimento de fazer algo com a câmera do celular (atualmente estou produzindo um mini doc para terminar a matéria), mas eu sinto que quero mais, até para realizar meu TCC e para trabalhar no futuro.  A partir disso, decidi que gostaria de comprar uma câmera profissional que eu possa utilizar para fotografar e fazer vídeos em boa e alta qualidade. No entanto, msm eu sabendo as configurações básicas e algumas especificações de câmeras por conta da faculdade, não sei qual modelo escolher para levar por muito tempo e com uma qualidade boa.  Então, venho pedir ajuda a vocês da comunidade para me ajudar e recomendar algumas câmeras para esse meu desafio.   Conversei com meu pai e vou poder ter uma ajuda financeira dele, então, por favor, me indiquem câmeras já com lentes ou lentes por fora dos mais variados preços, formatos, sensores, aberturas e qualidade. Então pode ser desde a que tenha mais custo benefício até valores próximos de 12 mil reais.  - Além disso, como é o mercado de trabalho em documentário? vale a pena?",belgeselsever,1hsc87j

"From long format interviews to 30 minuts reports. How!? Hi !  I’ve been running a YouTube channel where I publish hour-long interviews. It’s a format that works well and is quite common in podcasts, so it’s been successful for me so far. However, I’ve been thinking about switching things up to stand out from the crowd and create something different: more polished, dynamic 30 minute reports.  My idea is to combine selected parts of the interviews with supporting visuals (b-roll) and maybe include other testimonies or points of view to make the storytelling more compact and engaging. The goal is to create something more structured and fast-paced, like the kind of reports you’d see on TV or news programs.  But here’s the thing: when I sit down to edit, I find the interviews so interesting from start to finish that deciding what to cut feels like a nightmare. I waste so much time trying to figure out what to leave out, and honestly, I’m not sure I can condense something so extensive without losing its depth.  And to be honest, I’m starting to doubt if this is the right move. Maybe I should stop putting so much pressure on myself and just stick to what’s been working: full-length interviews.  How do you approach editing long interviews into shorter formats when everything i so interesting?  I’d really appreciate any advice or shared experiences. Thanks!",belgeselsever,1h9fa29
"Collaborative Documentary Workflow I just shot a documentary in Canada (my first one woop woop!) and I'm working on it with 2 friends, 1 who i shot it with (she was in front of the camera and the main protagonist) and the other 1 is the writer , who will help us structure the story now that we have all of this footage.  **MY QUESTION:** How do I figure out an effective workflow for all of us to work on this? I'm very experienced with all editing softwares. At the moment I'm editing with DaVinci, and would consider making a local server within DaVinci and teaching them how to use it, so that they can leave comments in there, but this would require my computer to be on at all times and me teaching them how to use the software, so it's not ideal. I've researched [Frame.io]( which seems like a great option that can integrate both with Premiere Pro (which I don't use as much anymore) and also DaVinci.  At the moment my free and temporary solution is to upload all of the interviews and talking head parts in a Google Drive, and they can leave comments there with what they think is most important to include (the B-Roll they don't need to see as much...I think). At the end, I definitely have creative control over the editing and storytelling, but need an effective workflow, so that they can leave comments and give their inputs. What do you think? Do you have any experience on working with others on a project like this? Any feedback is welcome!",belgeselsever,1h8yoke

"Any tips for a first-time documentary maker? Hii! I am not a documentary video guy, but there is this Social Science project for a documentary on Indian Law. My topic is the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita (Indian Citizen Protection smth). My script goes something like this:  **Title:** ***Understanding the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS)***  **Opening Scene** *(0:00 – 0:30)*   \[Wide aerial shot of Baroda’s bustling streets, transitioning to iconic landmarks like the Laxmi Vilas Palace.\]  *Narrator:*   “In the heart of India, laws shape our society and ensure justice. Today, we’ll explore the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, or BNSS—a modern law that has transformed our justice system. But how did it come to be? Let’s find out.”  # 1. From CrPC to BNSS: A Historical Journey (0:30 – 2:00)  \[Scene: Footage of the Indian Parliament, followed by visuals of legal documents and key political moments.\]  *Narrator:*   “The journey of the BNSS began in 2023, when the government recognised the need to replace the outdated Code of Criminal Procedure, or CrPC. Here's the timeline of its evolution:  * **11 August 2023**: The first version, *Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill, 2023*, was introduced in Lok Sabha by Amit Shah, the Minister of Home Affairs. * **12 December 2023**: The bill was withdrawn and replaced with an updated version called the *Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita Bill, 2023*. * **20 December 2023**: This updated bill was passed in Lok Sabha. * **21 December 2023**: It was passed in Rajya Sabha, completing its journey through Parliament. * **25 December 2023**: The bill received the President of India’s assent, officially becoming law.  This quick progression reflects the urgency and importance of updating India’s criminal justice system.”  # 2. What Was the CrPC? (2:00 – 3:00)  \[Scene: Archival visuals of courtrooms, handwritten police reports, and law officers.\]  *Narrator:*   “Before the BNSS, India followed the CrPC, which was established in 1973. It provided rules for police investigations, trials, and the treatment of offenders. While it served its purpose, the CrPC became outdated in a rapidly advancing world. Delayed cases and limited use of technology demanded reform.”  # 3. The BNSS: A Modern Law (3:00 – 4:30)  \[Scene: Parliament in session, visuals of people using technology, and police stations in action.\]  *Narrator:*   “With the BNSS, the government has addressed these challenges, focusing on speed, technology, and citizen empowerment. Here’s how it’s different:  * **Speedier Investigations**: Police must complete investigations within 90 days for most cases. * **Use of Technology**: Digital evidence like CCTV footage and virtual hearings are now standard practices. * **Citizen Empowerment**: FIRs can be filed online, and victims receive regular updates about their cases.”  # 4. Baroda: Adapting to BNSS (4:30 – 5:30)  \[Scene: Modern police stations in Baroda, with officers using digital tools and citizens interacting with online systems.\]  *Narrator:*   “In Baroda, the BNSS is already making a difference. Police stations are using technology to track cases efficiently. Online FIR systems allow citizens to report crimes without leaving their homes.  Local officers share how these updates improve their work.”  \[Cut to an interview with a police officer from Baroda.\]  *Officer:*   “We’ve seen a significant change. Cases are processed faster, and citizens are more confident in approaching us.”  # 5. Why BNSS Matters to You (5:30 – 6:30)  \[Scene: Students discussing legal topics in a classroom, with teachers explaining the importance of justice systems.\]  *Narrator:*   “The BNSS isn’t just about laws—it’s about ensuring justice for every citizen. As the future of India, understanding these reforms is crucial. With tools like online FIRs and digital trials, justice is becoming faster and fairer.”  **Closing Scene** *(6:30 – 7:00)*   \[Montage of Baroda’s streets at sunset, with children playing and people going about their lives. Text on screen: *‘Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita: Justice for All.’*\]  *Narrator:*   “From Baroda to the entire nation, the BNSS marks a new era in India’s justice system. Remember, change begins with knowledge—and now, it’s up to us to make it count.”  \[Fade to black with soft background music.\]  *End of Documentary*  I have asked ChatGPT for some filming locations too:  Here are some great filming locations for the narrator's lines, focusing on **Baroda (Vadodara)** and its surrounding areas. These locations will add visual interest while maintaining relevance to the documentary:  # 1. Historical Context: ""From CrPC to BNSS""  * **Laxmi Vilas Palace**:    * Film the introduction in front of this iconic landmark to connect the narrative to Baroda’s heritage.    * It symbolises tradition, aligning well with the mention of the CrPC's legacy. * **Maharaja Sayajirao University (MSU)**:    * Use the campus grounds to visually represent education and progress, symbolising the shift from CrPC to BNSS.  # 2. Modernisation Theme: ""What Makes the BNSS Different?""  * **Baroda Police Headquarters**:    * Seek permission to film outside the building, showcasing the local law enforcement adapting to the BNSS.    * A great backdrop for lines discussing police reforms and technological advancements. * **Vadodara Municipal Corporation Building**:    * The modern infrastructure aligns with themes of digital progress and civic empowerment.  # 3. Technology and Accessibility: ""Empowering Citizens""  * **Urban Civic Spaces**:    * **Fatehgunj or Alkapuri areas**: Capture visuals of bustling modern neighbourhoods where citizens use smartphones and technology daily.    * Public Wi-Fi zones or offices with computer setups can visually represent the ease of online FIRs. * **Coworking Spaces**:    * Use a professional coworking space like **DevX** or similar tech hubs in Vadodara to visually showcase the role of technology in BNSS.  # 4. Justice System: ""Why BNSS Matters to You""  * **Baroda District Court**:    * Film near the courthouse (with permission) for a backdrop to discuss justice reforms.    * Alternatively, use visuals of a court entrance to signify the role of the judiciary in BNSS. * **Vadodara Central Library**:    * The library can symbolise knowledge and learning, complementing discussions about understanding the justice system.  # 5. General B-Roll Suggestions  * **Sayaji Garden or Kamati Baug**:    * A calm, green space for filming reflective lines about justice and empowerment. * **Nyay Mandir (Temple of Justice)**:    * This heritage building in Baroda, once a courthouse, is a perfect location to discuss the historical journey from CrPC to BNSS. * **Vadodara Railway Station**:    * A bustling location symbolising India’s connectivity and growth, tying into the accessibility themes of BNSS.  # Practical Filming Tips  * **Get Permissions**: For government or public buildings like courts, police stations, or libraries, contact the respective authorities well in advance. * **Early Morning Shoots**: Capture peaceful shots of iconic locations without heavy crowds, especially at Laxmi Vilas Palace or Sayaji Garden. * **Drone Footage**: Use drones (with permission) to capture aerial views of Baroda’s landmarks for visually appealing transitions between scenes.  This is just the basic, and the dialogues might have some change. It is really a 5 man thing, and 2 people won't help. What should I improv, and any interview mics for cheap?",belgeselsever,1gx8djw

Louis has this nervous energy but is still bold in facing the many odd characters he meets, Ware is a wild man who is obsessed with finding his subject, and Broomfield comes off as a picture of British arrogance and confidence. What is this genre where the filmmaker is a character within it? They conduct interviews, narrate the film, and constantly give their opinions on the people and subjects involved.

"Need your help in quoting a fair price for working on a documentary as a MGFX Designer 👨🏻‍💻 Hi, I'm a DaVinci Fusion based Motion Graphics Designer, and I'm about to collaborate with a crew (remotely via Blackmagic Cloud) in order to provide my services for a documentary with an hour long runtime.  The documentary belongs to the field of Science, and deals with the subject of rapidly changing climate across the globe. The Producer(s) have a vision to incorporate Vox-style infographics, motion graphics, and 2D animations alongside the A-roll and B-roll in order to further elaborate and explain specific concepts, studies, and reports throughout the documentary. According to their quoted guesstimate, the total runtime for the motion graphics & animations should fall anywhere in between 10-15 minutes mark for the whole documentary.  So, with that information, here are my questions to you -  Q1 - According to the market rate, how much should I be charging on a project basis for creating 10-15 minutes of Vox-style motion graphics & 2D animations for an hour long documentary? (Your respective answers might differ, but here's the price that I'm thinking, which could be fair to quote here - $15k USD)  Q2 - The resolution of this documentary is presumably going to be at 4K UHD, and so shall be the resolution for the motion graphics & animations. But, if the resolution of the whole production comes down to 1080p HD, how much shall it impact (and subsequently alter) my quote for the price for the same duration of motion graphics and animations?  Q3 - There's a high probability that they'll eventually assign me with the task of doing the opening and closing credits as well. So, with this additional (but uncertain) piece of information in foresight, what should be my strategy during the talks before the contract/agreement signing stage in order to quote my price fairly, if we arrive at the aforesaid situation at later stages in the project?  P.S. - I'm a former Top Rated Plus Freelancer (Upwork), with an experience of 10+ years in the field of Design & Creative, especially as a Motion Graphics Designer. But surprisingly, this will be for the very first time in my relatively young career that I'm gonna be working with the Creatives who are directly associated with the filmmaking industry.",belgeselsever,1fbjzev
"Crowdsourcing Images for documentary I’ve been thinking about putting together a documentary based on a book I put out a few years ago. I’d like to accumulate as many photos of a certain time period (1930s-1940s) in certain parts of the US (mostly Midwest) as I can to use as b roll and to tell the main story.   I’ve been reaching out to some historical societies to limited results. These are generally places with small populations so they don’t necessarily have full time staff at organizations like that. So the thought had occurred to me to send press releases to what local papers are left and do sort of an open call for anyone who has appropriate images. As a former semi pro photographer I’m perhaps more aware of making sure people don’t think I’m stealing their photos. I won’t make the doc if I can’t raise enough money to pay something for the photos. So I’ve been trying to come up with ideas of how to let people submit photos in a way that is very easy to use and doesn’t feel too grabby. So far my main contenders are a Facebook group and/or a Google form connected to a Google account. But I was curious if anyone had tried this before and had any advice. I appreciate any feedback. I worked in the film industry for more than a decade but on indie features and commercials, not docs. So some aspects of this are new to me but not everything.",belgeselsever,1fbcoxt
"Apollo 13 documentary: how accurately did they display the astronauts emotions? I just watched the Apollo 13 documentary. What strikes me is the calmness of the crew upon the bad news, never before attempted manoeuvres & seat of their pants calculations.  I have no doubt that they were highly trained & prepared. Fully trust that in these situations any display of anxiety or panic compounds the problem, which they would have been selected/triaged for. Also they would have been aware that squawk boxes were in family house (although one could assume that these get cut off when things go wrong). But never a swear word?

How do I ask people if they'd like to do an interview for a documentary? I'm working on a short 10 minute documentary about a small towns local economy. Most of the film will be voice over and census data but I'd also like at least a few interviews. The subject matter of the doc requires that I ask low wage workers about their finances and how they afford to live in an expensive town. My main questions are how much do they make per hour and what their living situation is like. Do they rent or own and do they live by themselves and how much they spend on rent. My plan is to just visit stores and restaurants and to ask employees if they'd be interested in doing an interview for my documentary. I'll explain who I am and the premise of the documentary. They are free to skip any questions they find too personal. But I'm afraid of getting kicked out for bothering staff while they are working. So should I ask a manager for permission to interview employees first or should I just approach employees and ask if they'd like to interview. The interview will be quick run and gun and I'll be shooting it by myself. Each interview should take no more than 5 minutes to shoot. So how do I get interviews without getting kicked out/ bothering people while they are working?,belgeselsever,1f32tzi

"Help finding 90s social experiment doc. I saw a documentary over a decade ago about a social experiment that I BELIEVE was filmed in New York in the year 1999. A man fitted essentially a large basement with cameras, a huge open circle shower, cereal tube's, and bunk beds with cameras and tv's fitted to them to house (I'm  guessing) a couple dozen people for a year. Everyone's whole life was filmed. All the toilets where together and out in the open. The tv's on the bed only had channels tuned into the cameras fitted to the others beds. Completely cut off from the outside world. The only reason it was cut short was because it was falsely reported as a y2k bunker and was raided by the cops. Then the guy who set this whole experiment up went on to fit his entire apartment with cameras, including the toilet, and live stream his whole life. And when he started he had a girlfriend living with him and he kept trying to ""be the first couple to conceive live on the internet"" and she eventually bounced after taking a lot of manipulation and abuse from him. If I remember correctly there was a documentary that used original footage but explained both experiments in one documentary. I'm having a difficult time explaining to Google what I'm looking for.

"""From Class Project to Award-Winning Short: My Journey in Documentary Filmmaking (Trailer Included) Hello fellow documentary enthusiasts!  I'm Caleb, a filmmaker who recently completed my first documentary short, 'Golden Wings: Fifty Year Flight Path.' It's a personal project that chronicles my mother's 53-year career as a flight attendant with American Airlines, while also touching on my grandfather's contributions to aviation history who also worked as flight engineer and pilot trainer at American Airlines for 35 years.  To give you a taste of the project, here's the action trailer for 'Golden Wings: Fifty Year Flight Path':  [Golden Wings: Fifty Year Flight Path - Action Trailer](  I wanted to share my experience and maybe inspire others who are considering diving into documentary filmmaking, especially those thinking about telling family stories.  Some key points from my journey:  1. Finding a subject close to home led to a deeply personal and unique narrative. 2. Balancing personal connection with broader historical context was challenging but rewarding. 3. The project evolved from a simple class project to an exploration of aviation history. 4. We've been fortunate to win awards at the Independent Shorts Awards and the Clown International Film Festival in Paris.  I'm now in the process of expanding the short and diving deeper into the historical aspects. It's been a learning experience every step of the way.  I'd love to hear from others who've worked on family-centered documentaries or aviation-related films. What were your biggest challenges? Any tips for a filmmaker looking to expand a short into a feature?  Looking forward to being part of this community and learning from all of you.",belgeselsever,1edlmai

"Upgrading camera for ethnography filming Hello guys,  I have a question about a modest camera equipment upgrade. (If my request needs to be redirected to some other reddit community, please let me know which one would fit better for this question).  So I have been shooting a film about one family living in the mountains and used a really old camera: Canon 7d with Sigma zoom 18-50mm 1:2,8 EX DC lens.  The colours look simply wonderful, but it has been a bit tough for two major reasons: the noise when filming in the evenings was quite prominent (no surprise) + the manual focus (unfortunately I didn't have any external monitor) sometimes it was really thin because of low aperture (2.8). (My lens broke and it could only be set to 2.8. And since I was in the middle of the mountains there was no other way but to keep filming wide open and hoping to focus right.)  I was wondering if anyone started filming with dslr, what was your story about upgrading? Would you recommend me to get an external monitor?  What is the biggest reason to get a proper film camera like, let's say, Canon c300 mkii?  I thought that it was about auto-focus, but then discovered that nobody uses autofocus when filming...  This reddit community helped me a lot, so hoping that you can  Also, I would be really happy to connect with other documentary filmmakers who are interested in sharing their experiences and supporting each other emotionally and intellectually at various stages of the filming process.

"Why do USA produced documentaries jump between events? I don't regularly watch documentaries, but when I do they're normally local productions. Here the typical edit is in chronological order.  What I'm use to: Introduction (what is this doco about) -> Background events -> Catalyst event > Event A through to event Z > Aftermath, ongoing repercussions, call to action.   USA might look something like: Introduction -> Aftermath -> Background -> Jump to Event M -> Event A -> Event N -> Event B -> Introduction and Background again, maybe a reminder of the Aftermath -> Event A and B in brief and then new event C then do the same for M through O -> Repeat that format until you get through A to Z. Turning a 1 hour documentary into a 4 part series that is frustrating to watch.  Is this because of your advertising requirements, to make more money, is it the attention span of the audience, that's just how people in the USA like it, or some other potential reason I can't think of?  I just tried watching Hitler and the Nazis: Evil on Trial, I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes of the first episode, because of these editing choices.

I generally have my interviewee looking accoss the frame to me (e.g. camera left, looking camera right), with me sitting to the right of my camera and a key light from camera right.  My concern is that if I have the b-cam on the slider to the right of me but the interviewee looking at me, cuts between the main cam and b-cam will have the interviewee looking to opposite sides of the camera even if they’re still framed in camera left.

"Some tips for a documentary about a guy with celebral palsy Hello! I'm currently making a documentary about a man with celebral palsy, who have lived an amazing life. He has lots of beautiful and interesting pictures, as well as stories to go along with them. Here's my issue. I struggle to make it visual and exciting. What I can do is to let him narrate, though his voice is obviously affected by the cerebral palsy (not terribly tho, he can speak quite fluently) and I can interpose his beautiful pictures over it. But I think it gets hackneyed and boring after a while. Do you guys have any tips on beautiful human interest documentaries which have a more experimental and cinematic flair? Perhaps I can be inspired by them. My thinking is that I'll also follow him around a bit and film him doing stuff in his chair. Is that enough? I love the films of Abbas Kiarostami, by the way, so that is the sort of lyrical cinematic style I'm going for. It's quite hard though, I realize, lol.     EDIT: thought I'd add some threads -     1. He lives in quite a unique collective living place, with many eccentric people. I could film him interacting with his neighbors.     2. He has an ambiguous relationship with technology, being both ecologically minded, critical of cars. yet the car and his motorized wheelchair has been a huge liberation in his life.  3. He is a fighter who never gives up and is very determined.      4. I have worked as his ""personal assistant"" don't know what it's called in English. But it's a social welfare measure here in Sweden, payed for by taxes, where you have a person helping you with everything you need. we have a great relationship with much warmth and humor.

I'd like to know how all levels work, who the clients are, what they're paying for, what the competition is about (eg price on some levels, your personality/connections on different levels, solely quality of work on some levels?), what's the best level to get started, etc etc.  How do you get into getting hired for documentary shoots?

"score/sound design for documentary hello im in post on a doc I made with my brother and since im an avid musician I really would love to score/sound design the whole thing because it'll make it more personal for me and I figured why not! I started with some piano and creating actual melodies in the intro but the film is 90 min so it doesnt make sense to have melody the whole way as sometimes it takes away from the image.

"How do you search a documentary on Google? Hello everybody,  I'm producing a documentary on OCD and wanted your views. When you want to learn more about a documentary, how often do you google the name of the film **VERSES** googling the topic of the film?  So for example, if my film is titled ""An Unquiet Mind"" (and assuming it's already been marketed) - would you google ""An Unquiet Mind"" **OR** would you google ""OCD documentary / films about OCD / etc""  The reason I ask - we are trying to determine how much emphasis to place on ""uniqueness"" of the title. For fiction films, people usually search by title, **NOT** by topic (for example - you'd google ""legally blonde"", not ""blonde lawyer movie / movie about blonde in harvard / etc)  For documentaries however it's not as clear.

"Breakdowns and Breakaways: a storied plea (please help a homie out) Hey peeps! How's everyone?  Before I get into it, the overarching subject of today's plea post is: where should I go to break into adventure documentary.  Without further ado, grab your tissue boxes and popcorn, I'm about to rip myself open for commiserate's sake. Screw it, might as well juice the tragedy and hope it doesn't turn out too tart.  Working in financial tech for the better part of the last 9 years, I got to feel the whole 9 yards of the maxim ""if you don't choose, it'll be chosen for you"". Things is, I had chosen a life of art and adventure, going into rockclimbing, open water diving, and (to my bubble's standards) hardcore cultural adventuring. I relied on yoga for emotional stability which, for some time, helped attenuate the traumas of growing up in a family that not only dealt in expectations, but dealt me in with an unpayable debt from the get-go.  The dam broke when I got admitted into the ICU after having a nervous breakdown during a family lunch. Note that work was tough, but manageable. What tore the wall down was yet another poisonous interaction from the lair of snakes that yours truly spawned from. Without exaggeration, cysts popped up all over my legs, and the whole thing started burning and inflaming to the point where my knees had tripled in size. It took me 5 minutes to get up and walk from wherever I was due to excruciating pain.  Mind you, didn't think I'd be needing a cane at 31. After getting admitted I spent the better part of two weeks getting all sorts of medications pumped into me, whilst on a daily basis they would probe and examine me to find out what the hell was going on.  They couldn't determine what had happened, but the time away helped me dive deep to try and understand what on baby jesus' world was going on and how on baby jesus' love I'd be able to backtrack from this culling cul-de-sac I found myself in. The noose was tightening, but I'd be damned if I was about to give in to desperation.  Not me. Not the same guy who danced with the Tarahumaras in Chihuahua. Not this happy-go-lucky adventurer. My guardian angel had worked WAY too hard for me to give up and resign to the whims of others.  Nuh-freaken'-uh.  So here I am, with a couple of courses and a whole bunch of therapy later, coming to ask for some aid. The conundrum is, where? Where oh where should I go if I want to truly be able to break into the industry of putting myself on the line, warzone or not?  I found some interesting institutes, but I have no idea where to go from there. NYFA seems to me to be overhyped, churning students as long as they pay the price. Here's a couple I think make sense but, then again, how would I know? From my conception California is where the money's at, but I've been following paper trails way too long to go at it again. I want quality.  * **EICTV** - Gabriel Garcia Marquez founded this gem in Cuba that just seems to garner the best reviews. I know little of it, except that it is very highly spoken of. Cuba does have a history of leveraging scant resources with surreal results. * **Lodz Film School** - The creative corpus that this school composes is out of this world. Bleak is beautiful. * **Ravensbourne University** - Past posts did cite this university as a great stepping stone into the academy, but I couldn't find much on it in terms of docs. * **AFI Conservatory** - The one and only tried and true conservatory in the heartland of the industry. Actors, Directors, Cameramen alike from Hollywood's productions came here, but the sheer cost and complexity to get in make it seem like a moonshot. I am Brazilian, so you might as well multiply the cost by 6 for me.  I thought of Colorado due to the proximity to National Parks and adventure-prone community might make sense, but I don't know.  Anyways, thanks for bearing with me! Any advice is welcome :)  **TL;DR**   *I want to get into documentary filmmaking, specifically adventure and outdoors. How should I go about it? I need to further my studies even though I have some experience in the area. Should I focus on a specific college/institute? Should I choose based on location (closer to adventure hotspots and outdoor havens)? If so, what do you recommend?*",belgeselsever,1fiikmb

"Celebrity doc. Should I license footage I was hired/paid to shoot? Hey folks,  So I have been working with a musician / celebrity personality for the last few months filming studio BTS as they record a new album.  Initially, I did not draft a contract (I know, foolish) because I assumed this would just be a one-off, work-for-hire deal where I either directly hand over the footage and walk away, or at most do a few social edits myself.  Luckily for me, the scope of the project grew to about 2 weeks of filming and about 100 hours of editing (all of which I have already been paid my full rate for)  Now I have discovered that this celebrity is partnering with an independent studio in LA to make a documentary series. The people who hired me have not mentioned anything about this documentary, but from the press release it seems VERY likely that my footage could end up in this series.  \*As of now, I have NOT turned over any of my raw footage, but had an initial verbal agreement to do so.  At this point, I've been advised by other filmmakers that I should draft a contract to license my footage. But I feel foolish/unprofessional for backtracking and asking them to sign a contract to licensing the footage they already hired and paid me to shoot. I also don't want it to look like I am holding their footage hostage, but that's kinda what it would feel like. I don't want to burn any bridges for future work with this client.  At this point, is it reasonable for me to ask them to sign a contract that would license my footage? And if so, what sort of rates should I charge?",belgeselsever,1fgqk9z

"Going to law school to end up in film? Going to law school to end up in film…?  Please bear with me. I never really thought about going to law school but now that I’m a bit in a lull/crossroads in my career my family and close friends want me to consider it because they think I can still achieve my “dreams” even if I go to law school.  My background: I’m 29. I have been unemployed for a year but before that I spent ~5 years as a strategic researcher for labor unions. This was cool because I was an organizer in college who wanted to do more technical and investigative work. I worked closely with our labor lawyers and did a lot of legal research and wanna build off of those skill sets but not really in the traditional way I guess?  My “dream” - I know this is potentially silly but I truly know I can make it happen (even if I’m naive on how difficult the path will be). I would like to be a professional video editor specializing in unscripted works (docs and reality tv). I am good at technical database type work and have been procrastinating on teaching myself AVID but I know I can do it and try to work myself into a gig as I retain a day job in research. Aside from just editing I would love to be a researcher / investigator on docs and even dabble in camera/cinematography. Whenever I go to a live event I want to be the person on the ground capturing the footage. It would also be cool to work on some comedies/horror pieces at some point in the career in some capacity bc I love those genres and don’t see myself as much of a screenwriter (even tho I have a script idea).  So why law? I don’t know! The lawyers and loved ones around me are really telling me to consider is since I will learn a fuck ton about the world and build connections in the industry I want. I understand the benefits of learning copyright, IP, and contract law but will I be able to do that and still carve out a path in this creative field I’m just learning? I read up on famous documentary filmmaker who went to Columbia law school back in the day and her path was rly inspiring but I know what she did was probably rare bc most folks who have jds but don’t practice go into compliance etc  I know part of me is just lazy and doesn’t want to study for the LSATs and go to school for three years. But another part of me can’t help me wonder if going to law school will be super strategic cause if will make me way more knowledge and analytical, and better investigator. I could also just focus on using the program for my specific needs and seek out the opportunities/ internships/ research / classes etc that give me the ability to hone in on this larger storytelling/media craft I want to develop.  All of this is giving me extreme anxiety when I was finally getting motivation to finally look for jobs and train myself in editing stuff. My family is reasonable but I think worried about me because no one has ventured down such a path and they feel with law at least there will be a lucrative back up. I agree with all that.  I just feel like I’m in a time crunch bc my family is really insisting I start studying and apply this cycle but fuck that’s a LOT when the day before I didn’t even consider getting a JD. On the other hand I made nothing for myself or my dreams just rotting in my bed.   Any thoughts? I know I can learn a lot and become super confident and sure in myself in law school but if it’s going to be a waste of time / not as strategic as I think given my end goals I’d rather find other ways or other programs to expand my mind and practice",belgeselsever,1ff92hq

"Best budget-friendly camera set up for ethnographic film? I will be filming a short ethnographic film/documentary in 2026 for research purposes. The project will take place over the course of 9 months. The goal is to end up with a 20-30 minute film that consists predominantly of interviews. While I have experience filming, I've always used my university's (limited) equipment. This is the first time I actually need to provide my own and I am honestly at a loss. Here's some info about my needs:  * I will be in a rural area southern Africa, so it's important to have a camera that can handle intense weather conditions. I won't be throwing it in any lakes, but there will be high heat, dust, etc. * For similar reasons, versatility matters. I will be filming outside in conservation areas, inside people's homes, in offices with atrocious overhead lighting, at night and day, etc. * The set up should be on the lighter as I will be trekking around. From an ethnographic perspective, it's also best for things to be compact. I don't want people feeling as if there's a huge fancy/scary camera staring them down. * Although quality is important, the final product isn't going to be shown at film festivals or anything. The goal is to screen it locally in the communities I film for the purpose of exchange/discussion. Editing, etc. will be rough around the edges anyways, so I don't need the *best* image quality. * While I'm willing to invest some money in this, keeping things within-budget is important (grants only go so far). My max budget is around 1500 EUR. If that's unrealistic, I can perhaps move things around.  With this in mind, what would you all recommend to me?

I’ve heard an adobe app (audition?) can maybe do this but I don’t know much about it.,belgeselsever,1dqs4iy
"Is DaVinci Resolve Studio the goto these days? Just starting out and picking out editing software.

"I don’t know what audio gear I should get for my documentary. Hii!  I'm making my first documentary as part of my degree in Audiovisual Communication. The documentary will be shot in Bangkok and I have no crew, it is a solo project.  I will record some indoor interviews and the rest of the documentary will be shot outside. The idea is to follow different subjects through the city, sometimes listening to their stories and other times watching them interact with other people and their surroundings.  I will be constantly on the move, different subjects will come and go, the streets will be noisy... All these factors are making it so hard for me to approach this.  Lav mics can be great but I can't interrupt the natural flow and interactions to mic people, and I'm not sure if other options like shotgun mics can provide good audio at like 5 meters distance from the subject for example, or if they will cancel too much sound and take the life out of the recording.

Without the XLR handle there’s just the single 3.5mm mic jack. I’m wondering if I can use that 3.5mm jack in conjunction with a Sony mic that uses the hot shoe interface. For instance, can I get ECM-B1M mic and use it for ambient audio, and at the same time record a wireless lav through the 3.5mm jack? Or does using the hot shoe disable the 3.5mm input?

"Templates or AI aided editing for mini documentaries? Hi,  I'm working on a personal project creating short \~3minute mini docs of people in my community. I'm just doing it for fun in my ""free time"" and am realizing I have a very hard time culling out clips, being overly perfectionist about the end result. My brain processes much better if I can work from an existing point even if I end up changing everything from the original. I just find it hard to see the road to where I want to get from a totally blank slate.  Anyway that made me think that Ai might be helpful here to jump start and speed up my workflow, especially since it's purely a passion project.  Are any of you aware of AI programs (or templates) that can assist in compiling and organizing doc style work? I've seen really cool programs that can do things like take a podcast and pull out great soundbites and teaser clips or even take the video from a podcast and create video versions that focus in on who's speaking almost like a 2 or 3 camera setup.

"Waiver required for deceased interview subject? Many, many years ago, I began three documentaries,  having little experience in the technical nor legal side. For each of the interviewees in the documentaries, I had them sign a waiver that I wrote myself, but in retrospect was weak, little more than a model release. Effectively, they never signed a proper release, at least one that would be accepted for insurance purposes.  Most all of those interviewees, about an events that occurred in the early 1960's, are now, sadly, deceased. None of the documentaries were released, but recently I've decided to complete at least one of them and deal with the waivers issue head-on.

"Question about hability as documentary filmmaker with a personal relation to the subject. Hi documentary filmmakers out there. I have a dilemma that I wonder if some of you could give me some directions on.  I'm working on a short documentary about health and lifestyle, and are following a person with a chronic disease and who lives a quite active lifestyle. This lifestyle is what keeps her going and helps her to cope with sickness and other challenges.  My issue is that this person is my girlfriend and I live with her. As a solo filmmaker in this project, my question is should I be open about this relation in the film? Do I compromise my hability as a documentary filmmaker if I leave this information out?  I see that it is very common in modern documentaries to let the filmmakers include themselves in their films. It can give the film an extra layer of complexity. It also makes it more transparent, maybe builds more trust between the audience and the filmmaker. On the other hand, it can also be destracting and take the focus away from the subject and the main story. My film is going to be just 15 minutes, so it's not space for goofing around and such distractions.        What do you think, is it wrong to not establish this relation in the film?",belgeselsever,1cq4x4a

"There is a story happening now that would be a great documentary I’m not a film maker or anything close but there is a story in my family happening right now that I think would be a fantastic documentary. My sister in law went in vacation, and her dog escaped from the dog-sitter.   That in itself isn’t interesting but the amount of social media posts, likes, forwards, donations, and rural small community involvement is staggering and mind-blowing. People who don’t know her but follow the story of tracking the dog will break down in tears when they realize who she is.   There is more to it than that. She lives in a dying coal-mining town that has a very typical small town mindset, and your business is everyone’s business. These people have no money and still donate hundreds and thousands of dollars to aid in the search.  It’s just amazing. The dog has been missing since the end of July, but dog trackers and sightings say he’s still out there.   Just a thought for any filmmakers out there looking for a project.",belgeselsever,qjecew

"How will Documentary Films evolve? As a filmmaker myself, I am always interested in works, which are challenging  and defining the medium. Therefore, I would be curious: What do people here think about the future progress of the documentary genre?  Overall, I think, there have never been better times for documentaries and non-fiction films. Documentaries run on big screens  and many of them are highly successful on Netflix and Amazon. Compared to other eras, it seems, that there's much more money in the business to produce such films - Documentaries have become able to reach a mass audience.   In terms of style, I believe we will see more subjective, personally inspired works. As the global political spectrum becomes less centrist and shifts more towards the edges, it is imo reasonable, that we will see more politically determined works rather than being neutral or reduced to plain observing. Contentwise spoken, I think questions of identity and diversity will be a an even bigger thing, as they are already today (e.g. O. J. - Made in America, I am not your Negro etc.). On the other hand I think, we will also see much more public sensitivity on more heavy and controversial subjects (e.g. filming right wing people and racists, especially without countering their views on screen).  Stylistically I am a bit uncertain. There was a time, when a more subjective, reflexive style (Nick Broomfield, Louis Theroux, etc.) was very popular (and still is, but it seems somehow more a TV-thing now), whilst in the past decade there has been a new wave of more high-gloss works, like the ones by Orlando Van Einsiedel for instance (which I find generally beautifully shot, but sometimes they lack a bit of depth for me). In a Cinematic way , but through technical evolution, there has been a load of action-driven works, such as Free Solo. Although, I find this cinematic style personally a bit too fast, I think it will be the standard.   Where do you think the medium will move in the near future? Which trends, styles and approaches will be the next big thing? What are for you some of the recent works, that defined the genre in a new way?",belgeselsever,s0k1zy

"What traits or background make a good documentary filmmaker? Ill give a few I've observed based on my ~15 years of being involved in documentaries.   Number 1: Usually study something else other than filmmaking. The technical side is merely a vessel for the message.  Number 2: They are consistent, even in small efforts. Doing something every day for their project.  Number 3: Make projects based on people and experiences, rather than abstract concepts. This isnt to say this can't be done, but the best/most successful ones I've seen are rooted in people.  Number 4: Really good understanding of scope and practicality. They know exactly what they can and cannot accomplish and in what amount of time.   Number 5: Maybe the most obvious, but just never stop capturing stories no matter what they see, or do, or experience. Nothing is a limitation, except maybe money, of course.  This is just my take based on my experiences. What are your opinions?",belgeselsever,1joc0k7

"An Idea for film makers: cover how strained mormon families are. Mormonism is a matter of public health So many stories on r/exmormon  Lives destroyed is the daily norm for hundreds of thousands of us, who basically woke up to realize the culture is fraudulent.  Then they excommunicate you for knowing too much and gaslight and just generally play dirty.  Strip you of your tribe and family and sense of family honor and worthiness of love and respect.  Its super destructive.  Its a viscious attack on anyone choosing “Intellectualism” or choosing to just be honest and not go along w this golden plates native americans are cursed jews, cursed to lose caucasian ness- to be brown, closer to mormonisms satan who is essentially african.  Its pure garbage.  And if you recognize that and speak about it, the entire white supremacist culture attacks the shit out of you til youre emotionally dead.  I want it all just to be validated by a third party that yes - they are the crazy ones.  Publically.  Award winning documentary on the matter would be superb.  The worst is the grandmas are cut off for being unbearably culty bigots and they just dont have the mental faculties to see how the whole things a big lie.  Families get separated, the elderly die confused and alone, at least thats how my family is.  My grandma died and i had nothing to say to her she was such a bigot and said alot of totally whack stuff to me i wont repeat, mormonism programmed her and yeah she had a bad reaction to the experimental mandate stuff and declined and died.  The saddest part was knowing how terrified she was her non mormon family was going to hell.  She was a good intentioned lady but she died in crying dementia.  Because of that church straining her ability to relate to anyone living in modern times.  I will never forget any of it, it keeps me up at night  Soul wrenching stuff- i wish i could fix it for the millions of families affected.  The book of mormon is called the stick of ephraim- and its stated intented purpose is to “sew division”  Its cruel and unusual when your own family structure adopts it.  And its sad for pretty much everyone once one of the younger people does a single google search to find out they are essentially brainwashed about as much as north koreans.  Literally it takes 15 minutes of googling or visiting mormonthink.com etc, but all mormons are trained to avoid any criticism because they are effectively brainwashed to equate criticism of fraud to “anti mormon lies”  Its quite interesting to observe how effective the notion is at shattering peoples lives and families.  Letterformywife.com is a good intimate look into one example.  Documentaries could be made.  To follow the different perspectives.  The elderly have the mental capacity of 5 year olds-fully worshipping a conman’s elaborate freemasonic clone religion  Mormons demand 10% of everyones income to get into heaven or go to weddings etc  By doing that theyve become the wealthiest religion by far.    Its a very relevant topic actually they are ridiculously powerful and its pure poison if you really dig into what it is.

"Documentaries and Docuseries Whose Production Becomes Key to the Narrative Arc of their Subject Matter (whether inadvertently or not)??? Here are a few examples that come to mind for me:  \- The Jinx  \- Icarus  \- My Scientology Movie  \- Murder on Middle Beach  What are other good examples of this??  An overly-simplistic way of rephrasing it involves thinking of documentary/docuseries production as an extension of news coverage...here, I am interested in finding those instances where the news team becomes a meaningful part of the stories they are covering.  In contrast, the vast majority of documentaries and docuseries - even those that are closely involved with the events they portray - tend not become as actively involved as these ones and/or do not include relevant aspects of their active involvement.

"Genertational Grief and Healing I am a writer turned documentarian working on a film called [Stop, Drop, and Roll]( It is the origin story of the fire safety phrase that came from my family. It's the story of a tragedy at a backyard barbecue in southern California (1969) that lit my father and aunt on fire when they were children. My father (David) survived by his brother (Ethan) grabbing him and instinctively rolling him to the ground, putting the fire out immediately. According to historians, this was the first recorded case of ""Stop, Drop and Roll"" My aunt Alisa was not so lucky and kept running until her entire body was on fire. She went to the hospital with my father with 3rd degree burns all over her body. She ended up passing away at the age of 8. My grandmother out of grief needed a way to keep her daughters name alive, so she started the [Alisa Ann Ruch Burn Foundation]( that is going on 51 years of service. AARBF was a huge catalyst in getting ""Stop, Drop and Roll"" into schools across the nation.  With all of that being said. The origin story of SDR is just the hook to get the audience interested and engaged. The real story lies beneath the surface \]and is still being peeled back. It's about how trauma lives in the body and how grief can be passed down to generations of people. I want to highlight the physical and emotional sides of healing, particularly in Burn Survivors, since the physical scarring is visible and can be a life long journey. I spent years putting together family interviews and volunteering at my grandmothers foundation as a camp counselor for burn surviving children ages 5-17. I have learned so much and am still learning about the story and what it takes to create a film of this magnitude and importance. My friends production company has taken this on, -- [Purple Magnet Productions]( \-- which happens to be totally women owned and operated. I am Co-directing with an 8 time Emmy winning documentary film maker - Lauren Musgrove, and my talented friend Maggie Brown -- who has ran production for Jared Leto, and worked on shows like Modern Family, and AGT -- is the producer. I would love to get professional opinions about the film trailer that Lauren edited together. Advice on funding and market research would be greatly appreciated as well. I would also love to connect with other film makers. I am going to be back and forth from Los Angeles and Atlanta starting at the end of summer.

Nostalgia for docu style Does anyone else miss that late 90s and 00s style of docu films filmed with the subjects and film makers having involvement of each other before people kept a professional distance. The main ones I miss is “carts of darkness” and on a more lighthearted style “mischief 3000” and go some extend the likes of some skate edits that also follow the life’s of the subculture in the 90s like the cky series,belgeselsever,ur14pz

"Very early days of concept for doc, what do I need to know? Hi all, I am an aspiring film maker with the goal of directing narrative feature lengths but recently I cant get this idea of shooting this documentary out of my head.  I know the basics of film making and documentary but I am asking for like maybe a list of things I need to consider, equipment I need and other just general pointers for making a doc.  My experience is still in its early days but I am eager to go Calais in France where immigrants are pitched up in tents fleeing their homes. I want to go and volunteer over there and shoot a documentary in doing so.. interviewing the people there, letting them tell their stories, giving them a voice and show the harsh realities of how it is for them; eg not coming to England to 'steal our jobs'  for those who don't live in England and are unaware, there is migrant crisis, with many families trying to make the treacherous journey across the English Channel and some dying on this trip.. notably a family of 4 in the past couple weeks  with their 2 year old child still missing. This is something I am very passionate about and want to help with, as the general feeling in the UK is 'fuck these people, go back to your own country' - the countries our government supplies arms too...  I do not care for your personal politics so please leave your political views out of this, my question is about what I need to know for the pre-production/technical side of shooting a doc :)  Thank you in advance, all advice is welcome no matter how minor x",belgeselsever,ju3kme

"Learnings from the frontline - the History of Roadrunner Records EDIT 1 - tried to add like breaks. The Reddit app was having none of it.  Hello chums,  I'm around 50% through production on this music documentary. I accidentally fell into this, with the project (and my production company) coming out of a podcast on the topic, and catching the attention of private financiers. Here's a few of my learnings so far;          1. The toughest part of this process is location management. Having to film interviews with upwards of 20 artists around the globe as well as various label and industry personnel, on a budget, is a stretch. It's not possible to always film a substantive interview at the artists' house. Sometimes you have to make do with scheduling an interview while the band is on the road, and squeezing in 20 minutes after soundcheck, but before doors open. For this to work you need the band manager's buy in, the tour manager's buy in, the band's buy in, and sometimes - the venue themselves have to get involved. And even then, you need to make sure you're in and set up on time, which isn't always easy - shoot days are often a fast moving target, which of course comes with the territory with touring musicians. So my learnings here are to get as MUCH detail on location of filming nailed beforehand. Weeks beforehand if possible. And don't fret if an interview gets cancelled last minute - there's always next time.          2. If you're a solo filmmaker who can't afford a crew - where possible, try and at least get a mate to go with you for filming interviews. I've had non-professionals on hand just to carry stuff and watch the focus on Cam B, just because they wanted to be there - and it's allowed me so much more breathing room to focus on the interview and frankly, have a fun time with it.          3. On the other hand, I've also had paid professionals try their hand at steering the project, either operationally, or just on shoot days. My learning here is don't believe everything you hear from industry professionals - I've wasted literally days of man hours delivering for, or alongisde individuals who were only on the project because they smelled cash. The second they were required to get their hands dirty, they took their day rate and ran for the hills.          4. Music documentaries live and die by the clearing and licensing of artists' music and other media. Get a legal team on hand during production, and start making relationships with the rights holders alongside shooting -  so when tht first cut is done, and you know what music you need - you'll be on the front foot.          5. I'm speaking from an incredibly priveleged position of having some funding for my project. But if you think you've got a good story to tell - just shoot it on an iPhone with lavs, and a contingency Rode NTG2 plugged into a dictaphone.          6. I'll give you one thing I'm absolutely failing at on this project - social media. An essential tool to give the project some presence and interact with your prospective audience. In my case, I had so many opportunities come my way through the documentary's IG page. Fans of various artists came to me directly with footage and images they took in the 90s and 00s, interviewees once thought dead came out of the woodwork to volunteer their help - all invaluable stuff... I never proactively tried to grow the page, so who knows what opportunities I lost when the IG page got shut down by Meta. I actually breathed a sigh of relief because I generally hate IG and it meant I was forced to not have to deal with it. So there's a learning - take social media a little more seriously than I did, ha!          Looking forward to learning from you all as I move further through this process!",belgeselsever,1b5t1rh

"God Forbid: The Sex Scandal That Brought Down A Dynasty **God Forbid: The Sex Scandal That Brought Down A Dynasty - Shown on Hulu**  This documentary had the promise of an informative medium, but quickly delves into anti Trump/Anti Conservative sentiment. If you want to go in that direction, that is fine, but you broke the cardinal rule of quality documentaries, and that is you went off on tangents. This was supposed to be about the fall of Jerry Falwell Jr., but you let your feelings, judgments and emotions cloud your way through telling this story.  I was to the point of turning it off- we get it- you don't like Donald Trump. You didn't change my mind, so you even failed to do that.  Granda is made a sympathetic character, but he really was a flawed individual. Motivated by greed, attention seeking and sex, he is not an innocent. You involve yourself with shady people, it never ends well, but he kept at it. He has a lot to atone for in his life.  It was to the point of sanctimony that you showed all these hypocritial republicans, sucking up to Falwell to get his endorsement for the huge voting block of Christians, as if democrats don't do the same in their realm (I am anxiously waiting for the filmmaker's next project showing how democrats are in bed with just about every union, sucking up to them and allocating budgets for their endorsements, and how that is bad for the average Joe).  The other annoying thing about this documentary was the background music. Too loud. Too much. Too intense. You try to stir emotion of the viewer, because you gave up on their ability to feel it just by watching your storytelling.  It was an interesting premise from the outset, it just got lost in the filmmaker's leftist view, which is a shame.",belgeselsever,ypodp5

"Visual Approaches to Documentary Hey there,  Do you ever struggle with bridging the gap between the shot you envisioned, and the shot you actually captured?  Have you ever set out on a shoot with specific visuals in mind, only to feel like you totally missed the mark on the look you were going for?  Yeah, me too.  But the more I shot, and the more I worked with professional doc shooters, I began to notice a pattern: **80% of the work happens long before you ever hit record.**  I noticed that preparation and on-the-ground mental frameworks played a huge role in the quality and viability of the work. I discovered that shooters who did their homework – such as studying the characters, scouting and visualizing locations ahead of time, etc. – were producing disproportionately ""more cinematic"" work than those who just ""showed up"" and pointed the camera at their subjects. Shooters who had an understanding of cutting and how run-n-gun shots could be used in the editing room were making extremely valuable contributions to the storytelling.  I'll be talking about more of these insights in detail this **Friday, May 15th @ 5:30p EST** in a 90-minute workshop that's all about **shooting with intent**.  It's perfect for you if you're an emerging filmmaker who wants to learn how to consistently capture cinematic and highly viable scenes in your documentary projects. I don't believe in ""hacks"" or overnight results. Filmmaking – like and art form – is a honed skill and craft that takes years in order to develop your own workflows, style, and good habits. What I do believe in – and what I'm sharing in this workshop – are the frameworks and strategies I use on every shoot – no matter the budget – to find and film real, genuine, and beautifully captured moments in non-fiction storytelling.  The workshop is partnered with the Birmingham-based **Sidewalk Film Festival**, as part of their stellar online education series.  You can reserve a spot for the workshop here: [  I'm also tossing in a free PDF \[The Doc Shooter's Checklist\] for those that attend the workshop.

Wondering what are some of the key points in the process of pitching a documentary idea to potential funders.

(I am from Ireland. Probably different to bring on the streets of Hollywood, but nonetheless).  - Is kickstarter a valid option? Would you try it first before seeking other funding, or double up on it afterwards?  These are some off the top questions, but any advice in general on the subject would be great. Past experiences and what you found to be most effective?  As you can tell I've never funded a documentary.

"How to Credit Still Photographs in Documentary - CC/FU? I’m doing some volunteer editing for a non-profit oral history project. The piece is a community profile, that they hope gets a little play on the local PBS station (26:46).  They’ve given me a bunch of still images and archival footage from a bunch of different places (I didn’t do the sourcing, only editing):  - Facebook groups - Wikimedia Commons - Archive.org - Newspapers.com - Small history blogs - Scanned Images From Personal Collections  We’ve got a pretty solid Fair Use case for a lot of this: non-profit/educational, factual, only using small clips, not competing with old newspapers. I’ve been trying to figure out how to list all this stuff in the credits, haven’t been able to find good answers/examples on google, so I come to the pros with these questions:  1.) Is there a clean looking template/format for crediting images from websites/FB groups? I want the credits to look nice, and not include a bunch of junky looking URLs.  2.) Under Fair Use, do I even need to credit this stuff? I want to attribute where I can, but it’s really vague where some of this stuff comes from…  3.) How does Fair Use intersect with Creative Commons? Like with Wikimedia, you’re supposed to cite in a specific way. If I’m making a Fair Use claim can I tweak their format since it isn’t really optimized for film?  4.) Is there a higher standard we’ll need to follow if we want to air on our PBS affiliate or some other local channel? Will they want us to track down and source/label every photograph, even if we have a strong fair use claim? Will they want to see photo releases or anything like that?  Thanks in advance for your help. I mostly do commercial editing stuff so this has been a fun learning experience for me.  This is also the OHP’s first rodeo and they’re still learning the ropes.

"For a self-shooting documentary filmmaker, what's a recommended kit for 2021 and beyond? Hello everyone,  I'm getting ready to film my first feature documentary film and I'm trying to decide the best kit/gear for my project.  I hope more-experienced filmmakers can help!  I'll be covering a sensitive topic (involving abuse), so I plan to keep it intimate and shoot most of it on my own.  The following are important for me:  1. can produce professional quality images and has professional level XLR audio inputs 2.  easy to use and uncomplicated (I'll be doing everything on my own so I have to keep things simple) 3. somewhat light (I'm 5'1"" and I easily tire with heavy equipment) 4. a maximum of 2 lenses to interchange  I really want to get this right instead of fighting hard with the equipment during the project, so budget is not that restricted.  As long as I can enjoy using it for the next 3 years, I don't mind forking out some money now.  I've narrowed down my choices to the following:  1.  Sony FX6  2.  Sony FX3 3. Sony Alpha a7sIII 4. Canon EOS R5  The size of the FX3 is very appealing to me but I realized it's not in the list of Netflix-accredited cameras.  Should this matter?  I of course don't have a deal with Netflix , but it might be nice to have that covered in case the opportunity comes.  Thoughts?  For the lenses, I'm looking for an all-in-one solution since I don't want to miss any scenes while filming.  Maximum of 2 lenses. My shortlist include:  1. Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM 2. Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG DN Art Lens 3. Sony FE 35mm f/1.4 GM  4. The Canon counterpart if I do choose the EOS R5  I'm also open to anything out of this list.  I hope to hear some of your advice.

"Introduction To Documentary (3rd edition), Bill Nichols “We do well to take with a grain of salt any claims that a new mode advances the art of cinema and captures aspects of the world never before possible. What changes is the mode of representation, not the quality or ultimate status of the representation. A new mode is not so much better as it is different, even though the idea of “improvement” is frequently touted, especially among champions and practitioners of a new mode or technology. Every change brings a different set of emphases and implications, opportunities and constraints. But every new mode or new way of making and distributing work will in turn eventually prove vulnerable to criticism for limitations that some type of alternative promises to overcome. New modes signal less a better way to represent the historical world than a new way to organize a film, a new perspective on our relation to reality, and a new set of issues and desires to preoccupy an audience.”   I’m working my way through this book and thought this would be an interesting topic for discussion.   Have you come across any films that blend modes of documentary and/or push said modes beyond their limits into a possibly new mode? Also, any thoughts on the excerpt and/or the book?",belgeselsever,t7oif1

"Anyone using DaVinci Resolve (free version) for post? I’m in the unique and possibly unfortunate position that I got a good amount of my footage before I bought my gear for post-processing. It’s all primarily shot on iPhone and GoPro Hero 9 in 4K. I am familiar with DaVinci Resolve and am looking for a solid budget-mid level laptop for editing. I started watching [John’s Films]( review of different laptops around $1200 that work well with Resolve but he doesn’t go much into Free vs Studio version and I think the GPU usage is different in each. I also watched [Ben Kaiser]( reviews but that was more general specs and didn’t get into which worked best for my specific use case. I’m just a few days in to looking into gear and my head is already hurting so I thought I’d post in here (after searching the sub and not finding anything) to see if anyone is using Resolve (Free) to edit and if you have a laptop that’s handling it well. I don’t see the need to export video to anything greater thank 4K 60fps, so I don’t think I’ll need to upgrade to studio for this specific project. My documentary project is about the clean water crisis in Malawi and surrounding African countries, so nothing that would warrant anything greater than 60 fps according to me mentor.

"Idea for a documentary Mods please delete if this is off point.  I’ll be a documentary filmmaker in my next life.  In the meanwhile, I offer this up for discussion (or not) and For someone to use (or not).  In the 1980’s there was an incredible doc called “American Tongues”.  The makers went around the country talking to people - born and raised in America - about their accents.  Brooklyn, Chicago, Pennsylvania Dutch (Mennonites/Amish), Boston, Kentucky, Texas, you name it.  In the 21st century, something adding a layer would be, you’re in a city, and you get somebody to tell you where the nearest McDonalds is, when the answer is “you go to the end of this block and turn right”.  The way I would do it is have an associate beside me with a professional quality camera pointed down, do it looks like we’re on a break from whatever we’re doing.  We say whatever, “excuse me” or “hey can you tell me” or whatever.  Once someone stops and answers, you say “hey we’re filming a documentary, do you have like 90 seconds?  We’re asking people from here in (New York, Detroit, wherever) about their accents.”  And go from there.  So it’s about how people talk region to region, but it’s also about how easy it is to get somebody to stop and answer an easy question in different places.  Again, if this isn’t the kind of post you do here, just delete it.",belgeselsever,qiusff

I'd also like to interview someone who was disconnected from Islam until Covid when they got closer and reconnected with the religion.   I pitched my idea a few weeks ago to my professor but she's been very critical about it. She didn't think it was a good idea to do a doc about Covid because a lot of people have done that already. My professor also thinks that a doc about the mosque, the struggle with faith, and a person reconnecting with their religion is surface level and I can't go further in-depth with my idea. She keeps saying there isn't a story there and I should choose a different idea.  I disagree, I think it's an important documentary to do because there isn't enough docs don't on Muslims especially during the pandemic and how it affected them.

"I want to make IMAX 15/70 and other Large Format documentaries, anyone have experience with filming in these formats? Any advice? I have always had a fascination with IMAX and museum/science centers giant screen theaters for two things: 1, the technology, and 2, the cinematic documentaries. This last year, thanks to Covid’s isolation at home orders, I was able to finish my home theater projector system with an ultra short throw LED laser projector onto a 120” screen. Naturally I have seen every IMAX feature I can access on this screen to capture just a small glimpse of the immersion it was meant for, and it’s gotten my brain a-buzz with ideas on how i have stories I want to bring to life in large screen formats.   I’m starting small. I live in a beautiful volcanic region of the US and there is a set of Lava Tubes I would like to make a 20-30 minute cinematic doc about. There is so much story to tell about  its geological history, it’s cultural significance to the local Native American tribes, and it’s call to modern day hikers and adventurers. I will use equipment like the 4K Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera for filming, and then use local photographers for consulting, drone operators and a local video production company that has an impressive reel. I believe I can get crowd funding for this feature and my vision is to eventually play it at our local museums for a special limited time.   Anyway, to get to my goal of getting large format budgets, I am going to make a documentary the way I would with a Arri IMAX camera and see if people like it.

Here's our overview:   *On the 10th May 1943, something came ashore on Ballymanus strand in rural Donegal, Ireland. The next day, nineteen people, mostly children, were dead.*  *A generation of the small townland was lost. Calls for answers were silenced by the authorities. No one has been held accountable. The disaster is unknown outside of the close-knit community, and barely spoken of within it.*  *Ballymanus tells the story of one of the worst tragedies in modern Irish history, through the words of the victims’ descendants and the memories of the few remaining survivors.*  Here's the trailer for those interested:  [   The film has been accepted into 20+ film festivals, including the biggest film festival in Ireland (The Galway Film Fleadh) and has won best documentary at Vienna Independent Film Festival and the Irish Disappear Here Film Festival.   We're currently looking for distribution, but as this is our first feature doc we're quite in the dark on how best to go about this. We're aware that one possibility is to speak to domestic broadcasters.

"How to creatively use vertical videos? Hey fellow film geeks,  I have a documentary project this summer and some of the archive footage I am thinking of using has been shot vertically (on a phone). It's important footage, hence why I want to use it or otherwise I'd avoid.  I find the massive black bars either side to be quite distracting with vertical videos.  Does anyone have any creative ways to show footage in this aspect ratio?

I don't want to give too much away, but essentially it would be a take down of the meat industry. Basically, what I'm asking is, how should I go about this?

I have film industry connections I can contact and pitch the idea to, but I don't know much more than that. How do I go about making this transition? Is there a set pitch-treatment formula that people follow? Or is documentary making more about going out there and just doing it?

"Interactive Documentary: examples and benefits? Hello, I’m developing an idea for an interactive documentary and would really welcome some discussion around it, namely are there benefits of integrating interactive technologies to docs. Or is it a distraction to the genre.  From research it seems most Interactive Documentary examples (from festivals with that category, articles about the genre or docs who’ve given themselves that description) are predominately describing user generated content being included in the footage. UGC can bring a lot to a doc and sits well with other types of footage, but doesn’t feel like it’s fully exploring the potential of interactivity other formats are investigating.  I’ve seen some examples where the audience can control the narrative, choosing options at certain chapter points. This seems like a great way to give agency to the viewer and I’ve produced a scripted show that used this approach to create discussion points in a show.  But for documentary, where are guan ly the point is to make people think, or at least to inform. Interactive technologies used in sports, social, events or even Love Island could be amazing.  If documentary is in part about learning, then the call to investigate interactivity becomes even more of a demand.  What learning experience is at its best when you sit back on receive mode. My memory (and there’s not much of it) of sitting in classrooms was that this sort of lessons were the ones you absorbed the least.  Individual interactivity, from push notifications of prompts from the show as you’re watching it to clickable video to learn more at specific touch points (like you would with a well researched and linked news article online)   Collective interactivity, there’s a lot of evidence to suggest social learning is how must humans absorb most information. From Netflix Party to something as simple as WhatsApp turning documentary into hook groups.   These and more feel like rich areas to explore and I’m imaging others are working in similar veins, I just can’t find you.   Would love to hear any examples or ideas? But also criticism or argument for keeping the format more pure?  Many thanks!",belgeselsever,puzwoe

"Will a Chinese State-Backed Film Distort Our Expedition’s Story? I’m part of a four-person team planning a unique adventure expedition. A Chinese film company—backed by the Chinese government—approached us to make a documentary. One of our team members is Chinese, and it seems both he and the production company see this as an opportunity to create a film that highlights his role.  Initially, they presented themselves as an independent production, with about $500k budget for the movie, claiming they planned to submit the film to major festivals and platforms like National Geographic, Discovery, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and BBC. But after researching their background, I found no evidence they had ever worked with these platforms or attended international festivals. Despite being in the film industry for over 15 years (with the people behind the company having more than 20 years of experience), all their past work is government-funded, with a clear Chineese focus.  A major red flag was when they requested our passport details for their film release paperwork, explaining that this information would be provided to the Chinese government, which is funding the project. That was never mentioned in our initial discussions before.  My biggest concern: What are the chances they will fairly represent our international team, acknowledging everyone’s contributions, instead of turning this into a one-man hero story about the Chinese participant? From what I’ve seen, their past work follows a pattern of portraying Chinese figures as exceptional while downplaying others.  From a legal perspective, I see no way to enforce our rights once the film is made. If they misrepresent us, we have no real control over the final cut, and challenging a state-backed production from outside China would be nearly impossible. If any conflicts arise during filming, they could easily be used to shape the narrative in a way we don’t want.  Given that we not signed any agreements, what would be the best way to handle this? Should we distance ourselves now, or is there another way to mitigate the risk of being misrepresented? Looking for comments from those with experience in Chinese State funded documentary productions.",belgeselsever,1jcg88g

"Jewellery Documentary Hello  I am looking at making a documentary about diamonds in Africa.  The rise of lab-grown diamonds is having a profound impact on the lives of people in Africa, particularly in countries that rely on diamond mining to support their economies. As demand for lab-grown diamonds increases, the market for natural diamonds is shrinking, leading to declining revenues for governments and mining communities. This is having real consequences for ordinary people—especially in sectors like healthcare and education, where funding is heavily dependent on diamond profits.  In Botswana, where diamonds make up about 80% of export revenue and 30% of the country’s GDP, the drop in natural diamond prices has forced the government to dip into its reserves to sustain public services. Growth forecasts have been slashed from 4% to just 1%, and many fear that essential services like hospitals and schools will suffer as a result. Mining companies, including De Beers, have already cut production by 33% in response to falling demand, leading to job losses and economic uncertainty.  In Zimbabwe’s Marange region, where diamonds have long been a source of hope for economic development, communities are seeing little benefit. Infrastructure remains poor, healthcare is underfunded, and many schools lack resources. With fewer jobs available in the formal mining sector, more people are turning to illegal artisanal mining, which is not only dangerous but also comes with the risk of exploitation and abuse.  The shift to synthetic diamonds is also hitting workers directly. Many miners, who have spent their lives working in the industry, are seeing their incomes dwindle. In areas where diamond revenue once helped pay for doctors and teachers, communities are now struggling to keep essential services running. With fewer job opportunities, young people are left with limited choices, increasing the risk of poverty and instability.  While lab-grown diamonds are often praised as an ethical and sustainable alternative, the reality is more complex. In Africa, where millions of people rely on the natural diamond trade, the economic downturn is having serious, human consequences. As the industry evolves, governments and communities are being forced to find new ways to survive—but for now, the future remains uncertain.  And id like to highlight how cheap comes at a price, especially in China, have been raised about the use of forced labor in certain sectors of China’s manufacturing industry, particularly in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Reports indicate that Uyghur and other Turkic minorities have been subjected to state-sponsored labor transfer programs, often under inhumane conditions.",belgeselsever,1j6fe1h
"How can I make a documentary about my dad's old band? Hi, everyone!  I'm planning to make a documentary about a band called ""Oásis"" (not the British one), which was very popular in my city (I'm Portuguese, by the way) in the late 90s and early 2000s. My father was part of it until his late 20s, and now, almost 25 years after the band's breakup, the old members are getting back together. I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to document their story!  The problem? I've never made a documentary before. So, I'd like to ask for advice from anyone who has been through something similar or has experience in the field. Some questions I need help with:  **Equipment:** What essential equipment do you recommend for an indie documentary (cameras, microphones, editing software)?  **Narrative:** How can I build an engaging story? Should the focus be more on interviews, old archives, or the band's reunion?  **Script or structure:** Should I plan everything in detail or let spontaneity guide the documentary?  **Sound and soundtrack:** How to manage music rights (if using old recordings of the band) and ensure good audio quality in interviews?  **General tips:** Mistakes to avoid, tricks for getting good interviews and creative ways to tell the story?  If anyone has experience or simply wants to give suggestions, I would be super grateful! I really want to do justice to the band's history and the impact they had on the local music scene.

"Seeking camera person for UK Homelessness Documentary – I’ll Write, Narrate, Interview and Edit I’m creating a documentary on UK homelessness, exploring why the English government ignores the crisis despite EU pressure (UK is arguably the worst country in the first world on homelessness), why this topic is ignored, human rights violations involved (I'll interview respected uni professors of various topics hopefully!), and how poverty, wage inequality, and lack of access to whole foods & nature impact mental health (psychiatrist lined up for interview). I’ll write, narrate, and edit (I have decades of editing experience behind me fortunately), but I would like a person to handle filming (I can teach lighting, framing), setup interviews, and assist behind the scenes. The plan is to challenge ministers, interview experts and homeless, and highlight systemic failures until action is taken. This is no small undertaking. The ultimate goal is to wipe out homelessness as councils shouldn't have a ""housing list"" - there should never be anyone spending a single day on the street in this day & age since there's enough wealth / resources already. We will also prove this point on paper / interviews with economists / experts.  I'm going to make this a YouTube series with a dedicated website. I want us to eventually have enough experts and set up a company to be available for government consultation on this topic- to teach them what needs to be done (as it's not just money, there are systemic changes that need to take place such as significantly raising & linking min wage to inflation, universal wage so no one ends up on street regardless of inability to prove health issues, and how ability to save for pension or small breaks / holidays should not be considered ""luxury"" - our ancestors worked on average 5 hours a day hunting - that was outdoor exercise & socialisation... work nowadays is slavery by comparison & yet doesn't pay eough for the majority to be able to afford a holiday or break from it...). There is a lot to cover so will be many documentary episodes.  Policies almost always impact the poor disproportionately more than the elite (e.g. congestion charges, parking fines) and clamp down on the hoarding of wealth while not contributing to society and taking advantage of the masses). It all starts with documentaries / exposure. We'll also talk about how the elite set up cliche ""sayings"" designed to keep those without enough to survive quiet - such as ""money doesn't bring happiness"". This isn't going to be an easy one as the elite are in control. How even social media influencers are taking advantage of homeless for views & profit. But change will happen. We will also establish what the actual min wage should be in each area (likely multiple times higher). DM if interested!  Obviously this will be funded through views on youtube so I'm working for free to start off with, as will we both be- ultimately the hope is that views will pay enough to cover our salaries. Just because we're highlighting a systemic issue does not mean we don't also need to survive. Everything over our salaries if ever we make any more, will go into the pot to help push the project further. There is a public view that anyone highlighting poverty must themselves be poor or suffering. This is wrong. No one should be. We should all be making enough to LIVE, not barely survive. That means a home, affordability to raise a family, have financial stability, pension..etc.  We will interview people at the top and at the bottom, and the middle in terms of earning power...  This is close to my heart as I've been through a lot of similar in the past. I've also been at the bottom, and the top in terms of earning power and I see things that I think need highlighting.  The world needs to change. The UK needs to change. This form of ""dog eat dog"" world is fast becoming a thing of the past. The government has been in talks about a universal income. The public is becoming more aware, and we need to push this further.  If you empathise with any of this, DM me thanks.",belgeselsever,1ipfo04

However, even with all this work already done I didn’t realise just how much more work I’d have to put in, any advice would be more than welcome about incentives, and even your experience if you’ve ever crowd funded before.",belgeselsever,1c0weib

"Minimum bitrates for raw footage (sorry, this will be messy) I've tried looking this up, and there seems to be a slew of AI generated shit on this now, and trying to find examples on YouTube is not super easy.  There are diminishing returns on bitrates, provided the resolution and codec are the same. Sure, a different camera may have better glass and a more artistic feel to the footage, but the technical quality will stay the same. (I know. Don't bug me on this!)  So, completely independendt of what camera or phone you're using to record your footage, what is the lowest bitrate you would use?  In my case (for flexibility and for saving money) I'm using OpenCamera on a Galaxy S10.  I've decided that 1080p is good enough.  I've decided that 24fps looks best.  Meaning I could shoot some stuff (B roll) with my LX100 or GX800 or Pen-F or insta360 too.  All this will be H264.  Now, my LX100 does 24fps in 24Mbps. In OpenCamera, I can choose 20 or 30Mbps.  This is just the footage. It will be edited and rendered. It will be uploaded and converted.  But what is the ""golden"" bitrate for recording? For 1080p/24fps?  I don't plan on recording confetti or the like, but I'd like for wrinkles in close up on faces not to disappear when people move. I've seen vlogging at 8Mbps that looks perfectly usable for vlogging, but I wouldn't use it for a documentary.   I guess, what I'm actually asking: Do I need to go above 20Mbps? I know I can ""get away with"" going lower, but honestly, I really want footage to be clear and accurate.  What's the lowest you would go?  Other technical limitations: Shooting to 32Gb SD card (endurance/long life, for dashcams) and dumping files to USB stick OTG. Limitation: Higher Mbps means more frequent and longer dumps. And bigger USB sticks.",belgeselsever,1bslxjc
"Complete Novice filmmaker seeking advice for first project Hello!   This is my first post here and so I come with complete humility, so please excuse my naiveté.   I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible. I am seeking advice from others to find the best way to approach this.  At the end of April I will be traveling with a local area band for a small run as they travel to a different state for recording their next project. It might help to add that I am good friends with these group of guys (biased). I thought it might be a cool idea to document the traveling and production of the project: road trip and in-the-studio making of the project. This is a very low-stake situation and honestly, more aligned with just a personal project. I have never recorded and edited a documentary before but I am hugely inspired by the band Periphery's documentaries that they release alongside any new album release. I really like the style and narratives of those documentaries and may use that as inspiration.  Here's what I got (gear + sw): iPhone 15 Pro 256GB, Shure MOTIV MV88+ microphone, M1 Pro MBP 1TB, Sandisk 1TB Portable SSD, Final Cut Pro, tri-pod for iPhone, & portable LED light  I guess where I am seeking advice is- I am doing as much research and learning as I can such as YouTube University with learning how to edit videos with Final Cut Pro, finding the best camera settings with iPhone etc, but I am questioning the practicality of how I will be able to accomplish of compiling all the footage, should I be using the Blackmagic Cam iOS app or just the native iOS camera app, is the relatively lower storage space of my recording device going to be a hinderance, etc.  I am going through the planning stages right now and most of it includes what I really want to capture and crafting the most objective style questions for the band members as possible that really explains the project and the band as a whole.

"Working on First Documentary Seeking Advise around Ownership I'm currently working on an exciting project to create a documentary about a fascinating local poet. Initially, the poet was interested in sharing their story, and I proposed to help by recording a sit-down interview or podcast for free. However, after delving into their story, I realized the potential for something greater and suggested expanding it into a documentary. This project represents a significant commitment, and with no initial intention of profit-making, I saw it as a chance to craft a story at a high level.  &#x200B;  As the project's scale grew, I brought on a friend to assist, and we're now in the process of assembling a budget and reel to seek funding. This is uncharted territory for me, especially regarding ownership and distribution concerns. The project's inception was tied to the poet's upcoming book release, viewing the documentary as a promotional tool.  &#x200B;  Previously, my projects didn't involve navigating ownership since I was the sole creator. However, for this documentary, I'm contemplating retaining full ownership. Yet, I'm uncertain about the implications when the documentary centers on someone else's life and involves collaboration. Despite planning to compensate my friend from the budget, I wonder if that necessitates sharing ownership. Moreover, while I intend to allow the poet to approve the final edit, I'm unsure if that extends to granting them ownership rights.  &#x200B;  I'm seeking diverse perspectives and feedback on handling ownership and distribution in such collaborative creative projects. How should I approach the distribution of ownership rights between myself, the poet whose story we're telling, and my friend who's contributing to the project? Im not really sure what the industry standards are in this regard. Am I being greedy?",belgeselsever,1an4h4d
"My first One-man-army documentary is released today My first one-man-army documentary ""SIDY BADJI - A GLOBAL CITIZEN"" will be released today. 🇸🇳 🎥  The film can be watched here:   Back story: One evening in early January 2023, I sat in a restaurant in Odense and was told the story of Sidy Badji, a remarkable man with an impressive life story. For 43 years, Sidy had served as a social worker in the Odense Municipality until he made a bold decision: to return to Senegal and run for mayor in his hometown. That story deeply touched me, and impulsively, I grabbed the phone and called Sidy: ""You sound too cool! Do you want me to travel to Senegal tomorrow and follow you in your role as mayor for a month?"" Fortunately, Sidy said yes, and the next day, without hesitation, I packed my camera bag and set off. I knew nothing. I didn't know the African culture, where I would stay, what they ate, what language they spoke, or where Sidy's municipality was located. And last but not least, I knew NOTHING about Sidy. My meeting with Sidy and my journey to Senegal have changed my life for the better. This experience has given me a deeper understanding of another culture and has challenged me to step out of my comfort zone and act on impulse. Now, after a year of intense work editing the documentary, I can proudly say that I have created a work that I am incredibly proud of. I have decided to take destiny into my own hands and release the documentary myself. It has been a journey filled with both fear and excitement, but I believe in the value of the story and the potential of the documentary.",belgeselsever,1ak8e0n

Writing/preparation before filming I was wondering if it was compulsory to write down some script/treatment before going to shoot or if you find your intentions while on the field because you cannot always plan what's going to happen exactly. Maybe it's a matter of personal method. But what amount of preparation is necessary in other words? I'm curious because I don't want to end up with say 10 hours of footage then not having found what story I want to tell... Shall I trust the process I'll be finding it when filming or do I need to have my intentions clear beforehand?,belgeselsever,132cm22

"How do you register a series of documentaries when you're a team of three? I produce and direct a documentary series where we follow and film paranormal investigations and dig for history that backs up the findings. We're just three people who got together to make these.

Should I open it up to Indian cuisine, in general, and interview food critics, influencers, culinary professors, in addition to profiling the restaurant?  B) What questions should I ask during the interviews/profiles? What are the “must includes”? Things to know? Things to avoid?  C) What’s a good documentary “starter kit”? Equipment? I’m not looking to make a career out of this, maybe just a few small projects here and there so somethiny budget friendly.

I have decided to pursue an independent career now and I want to buy a starter kit that would get me going with my first few short docs.  I’m divided between buying a mirrorless camera or a dedicated video camera.  In my budget roughly I can buy Canon c100 mark II, even though it’s an old camera and doesn’t record 4k, the video quality is still pretty decent and has option for xlr inputs as well which means I won’t need an external field recorder for sounds. On the other hand there are various mirrorless options and while one can do photography with them as well(I do documentary photography too), the limitations of sound, carrying an external recorder, rigging the whole thing up for a solo shooter will take a lot of time and can be overwhelming when you’re short on time.  I’m divided right now but in my head I think I will go for Canon C100 mark ii, as 4k is still a luxury back home. Given the better computers and more space required for edits etc.  I would love to hear opinions from everyone here.  Thanks",belgeselsever,v3ze1v

"Are conflicts almost always inevitable in good movies when shooting? Hi everyone,  I just want to have other people's opinions on this.   So far the movies I have directed (docu-fiction films) that had a fairly good career in festivals were always conflicted. Either there is a problem with the main character (that is fed up and leaves in the middle of shooting) either we realized that the movie was bad so we rewrote the whole movie in the last two days of shooting (out of two weeks).   There is always some kind of conflict with the team or the characters, but it always comes out unique and ""osé"".   For example Werner Herzog, all his movies are like wars. People wanted to leave, they are injured, they threaten each other, the director becomes crazy, etc. He always has a crazy story to tell about the shooting of a movie.   When I went to festivals it was all kind of the same with the great movies I saw: the directors always tell there is a conflicted story behind the shooting.  Meanwhile, some more ""amateur"" and polite movies feel quite bland (like they didn't have the guts to go further into the matter), they are usually youtube documentaries or tv reports.  &#x200B;  **I ask if you do have a similar experience or a similar opinion about whether you also think that great documentaries are always like an inevitable yet beautiful field of landmines.**",belgeselsever,qmmzf3

I know the basics of repair and mixing, but learning a little won't rival engineers with years of experience.  So I'm considering hiring one. Most of the freelancers I've found online specialise in podcasting, but I have strong reason to believe this would work. There is very little music in my film as the interviews are tightly edited and the audience have a lot to take in. My only concern would be sound effects - there aren't lots of them - but they shouldn't need any special treatment beyond mixing, right? If that's the case, I'm able to handle them. Would there be any other disadvantages to hiring an audio engineer who specializes in podcasts? The film would also premiere on YouTube, to be watched mainly by earphone and headphone users.  Many thanks,   Harry King",belgeselsever,mxt7s2
"Transcribing Interviews and Pre-Processing Raw videos Hey everyone, I am a filmmaker working on my first documentary.  I am wondering what your workflows are in terms of processing  interviews and daily footage you get from your documentaries. Do you transcribe all your interviews with time stamps or only write general notes? Do you try edit during filming or do you wait until you finish production to look at all your footage?

The general gist being, basically I’m interviewing people who work at a certain company ( I work for this company too) and they’ll be giving their personal accounts of their time there (more than likely it’ll be negative) and they may **name drop higher up people who work for this company.** (I know to get release forms from all my interviewers) My question is, when it comes to the legal aspects of this, making sure I don’t get sued for defamation of character etc etc, **is it ok for them to name drop?** **What are the possible legal ramifications I may face for releasing this? And and how can I avoid being sued by said company?**     As i stated already, I know to get release forms for all interviews, and locations i may film at. What i'm worried about is, If the interviewers (and myself, because i also work for this company) name drop certain higher up individuals, **could we get sued for defamation?

Somehow he finds out that they're actually werewolves, which, y'know, wouldn't fly. Nobody would believe  that. They also know and keep a secret of his. Realistically, if he chose to lie about them to protect them, so he goes with the 'they're a totally normal family unfairly accused of being a wacky cult', what would happen? Would he be fired if someone were to find out? 🤔    Not necessarily because of the lie, but because someone who would lie for his subjects just doesn't  have what it takes to be a documentary maker. The family had approached the studio because they were hoping that if they seemed normal everyone would finally back off and leave them in peace, but the studio was hoping they'd turn out to be sufficiently weird. They send the character in becoming it's reasonably light fare.",belgeselsever,1jis12k

"Lower Thirds Question Hey all,   I'm working on a short-ish documentary (it's about an hour). Two of the interviewees is audio only, they didn't want their faces shown. I added a lower thirds title when they first speak with their name and title. Since their face is not shown, should I add this title each time they speak? I'm slightly concerned viewers would forget who is speaking. One of the interviewees first speaks at 5 mins in, then at 15, 45 and 50 mins. So it jumps around a bit. However there is an interviewee who is on screen, and having his title only shown once, while the rest are shown about 4 times doesn't seem right. What's the best course?  By the way, not sure if it matters, but they're all speaking in Chinese so there's subtitles each time they talk.  Thanks!",belgeselsever,1j3luab

Thoughts on my lighting setup for documentary interviews? So I'm putting the last part of my kit before starting interviews for a documentary I'm working on. Based on budget of about $2500CAD I've mostly narrowed it down to a few items but want to get feedback from Pros and Joes alike on whether I'm missing anything here:  Key: Amaran 300C RGB with Aputure Light Dome 150cm softbox  Fill: Amaran 200x S Bi-Color with an Amaran Rectangle Lightbox 30cm x 120cm  Hair light: Aputure Amaran PT2C Pixel LED tube with 45 degree grid.  I already have an older Neewer RGB660 panel light with barn doors I was thinking of using for backlighting/seperation but it's not the brightest light but not that bad either.   I also have some 5-in-1 reflector kits for fill/neg fill and stands etc.  Which leads me to ask...what could be tweaked/changed or added to this setup for best results?  I'm exclusively shooting about 25+ sit down interviews with one person in different settings and although I know each scene/setting is a different and a lighting kit is never a one size fits all type of deal would this get the thumbs up/down for the most part?

"Should I Use Arabic or English for My Personal Documentary? Hi Reddit,  I’m a documentary filmmaker and video editor, and I’m starting a new project that’s different from anything I’ve done before. It’s a personal documentary about my life events, and I plan to share it on platforms like YouTube and Instagram.  Here’s where I’m stuck: language. My mother tongue is Arabic, and I feel much more authentic and connected to my story when I express myself in Arabic. But I’m also fluent in English, which is a global language and would make my documentary accessible to a wider audience.  I’m leaning toward speaking in Arabic and adding English subtitles, as it feels like the best way to stay true to myself while still reaching a broader audience. However, I’m not entirely sure if that’s the best approach.  Would it be a good idea to stick to Arabic and rely on subtitles, or should I consider speaking in English to maximize accessibility?

"How does someone like Brian Peck continue to support themself financially? The oldest misconception about Hollywood is that everyone who works in the entertainment industry is super wealthy. I don’t think Brian Peck is as rich as some people might think.  I grew up in the same neighborhood as Brian Peck. It wasn’t a super wealthy area. Both my parents had blue collar jobs. They weren’t rich by any means, but we were able to afford a three-bedroom house on a mortgage.  I don't think there's any cheap place to live in LA, but the North Hollywood/Van Nuys area isn’t where people tend to move when they have a lot of money. Just to be clear, I’m *not* hating on North Hollywood. I absolutely love my hometown. I'm just saying people don't tend to move there when they make tons of money. They tend to move out when they make tons of money. It's not Beverly Hills or Palos Verdes.  As for Brian Peck, I don’t know exactly how much Nickelodeon or Disney paid him when he worked there. but he was a dialogue coach, not a lead actor or director. I don't think he was making a fortune in that job.  How has he been supporting himself all these years that he's been out of work?

"American kids/ tween tv is so self centered I'm American, but have watched a handful of youth tv shows from other parts of the globe: H2o, Blue Water High, Dance Academy, (my holy trinity of teen tv, I love ALL 3 so much!!) House of Anubis (ok this is partly American, but UK filmed and proudced), some episodes of Das Haus Anubis (the German equivalent),seen a few episodes of Road to Avonlea (I'm saving to get the dvd set!, and yes it's partly American produced with Disney channel, as a co- producer but really it's Canadian). I even saw Alien surf girls (lightning point), though it's not as good; point is all of these tv shows hold up much better than their American counterparts.  Compared to icarly, Hannah montana, Victorious, Wizards of Waverly place, Suite life, etc, all of those foreign tv shows are better produced and real, and also relatable.  The foreign tv shows are more serialized and treat their audience with some intelligence. No dumbing down, relying on some stupid humor or gawd awful laugh track. Or making the main characters insanely narcissistic.    I love the way the group of kids on Dance academy and Blue water high have real problems and don't just bully some kid/ classmate, just because. If there is tension between 2 characters, you see the reason behind it. It's more human and connective, the problems and solutions.   Or the girls on h2o, they are the best of friends even when they get on each others nerves they work through it.   Contrast this to say, Miley not getting her way and pouting about it because shes a popstar and has to get everything she wants. Or carly acting immature because spencer actually said No. These amercian shows on nick/ disney are designed to showcase 1 person, and it didnt help. Miley, Demi, Selena all became superstars with the rest of the kid actors pushed to the sidelines. H2o- all 3 girls became globally loved.   I regret watching so many crappy disney and nick shows, when I found my niche really is foreign produced youth tv. H2O makes my list of my top 10 tv shows ever, and blue water high and dance academy make my top 15.   Looking behind the scenes, there certianly was no dan Schneider figure either. On road to avonlea, one of the actors mentioned in an interview, the kids when not filming were either with their parents being supervised by them in their trailers or having to do school on set. No creepy downtime with a male producer. The girls on h2o were never made uncomfortable on set, and they were in and out of swimwear and mermaid tails.   I think America dropped the ball when it came to making tween/ kids tv. We may have became the most famous with the tv shows, but we sucked in terms of quality, rewatchability, and connectibility.",belgeselsever,1klbprr
"MOD MESSAGE: Regarding sub rule #8 I want to make it 100% clear that this is NOT a Drake Bell sub. In the early days of this sub there were a lot of discussions relating to Drake's case involving a minor and they were completely derailing posts and conversations related to the docuseries and the other people and networks mentioned within it, hence why the rule was created. The back and forth comments relating to the allegations quickly become hostile and it creates a toxic environment for everyone here. Comments referencing the case in passing as they relate to Drake's healing journey are ok but they cannot be the sole topic of discussion.

"Trying to understand why drake bells abuse went so unnoticed I know it’s been a year, but I still can’t stop thinking about how Drake Bell’s mom, and his stepdad, had no idea what was happening to him. I understand that hindsight is 20/20, but that was their child. How do you miss something so serious? He said he didn’t want to be around BP, and yet they still made him spend time with him. I get that Drake is an actor, but no amount of acting can completely erase trauma. He was being abused. How did no one close to him pick up on that?  And I’m not trying to speak insensitively, but the reality is, when someone is being abused, especially as a child, there are usually signs, physical or otherwise. I know not every survivor comes out with visible bruises, and marks aren’t always intentional or even noticeable right away. But when there’s struggle, fear, or manipulation happening, it often leaves some kind of trace whether that’s physical (bruises/marks), emotional, or even just a change in how someone carries themselves. When I look at pictures of him from before it all versus during or after you can almost see the pain in his eyes. It’s honestly haunting. There’s just something different in his expression that I don't know how to put into words. I don’t understand how a parent could look at their child and not sense that something was wrong.  His girlfriend and her mom noticed something was off almost right away, but his own parents didn’t? That’s hard to comprehend. I’m not saying they were willfully ignoring it, but to be that disconnected from what your child is experiencing it just feels like neglect, whether it was intentional or not.  I know I’m not a parent, and maybe I don’t fully understand what it’s like. Maybe things were different back then, or maybe there were factors I’m not aware of. But this has been bothering me for so long, and I just needed to say something. I’d really like to know what others think, too and have a conversation with some people wether you agree and have something to add, or you have a better grasp/ understanding on how this is possible and would like to share and explain.  (And to be clear, I’m not accusing his parents of knowing and turning a blind eye. I’m just struggling to understand how something so serious could go completely unnoticed by the people who were supposed to protect him. Sorry if this is taken that way or alot)",belgeselsever,1k5p0qu
Drake Bell Phone Call to BP I’ve been thinking about this a lot. It’s surprising that the police would use Drake to get a confession from BP over a recorded phone call. I think California is a two party consent state?

Anyone knowledgeable on this?,belgeselsever,1kcp4ok
"Child Star doc (Demi Lovato) I finally got round to watching Demi Lovato's Child Star documentary and I found it underwhelming. What are other people's thoughts?   TLDR, I feel like Demi got in some big names to talk to, but overall, the doc was way too short, it didn't have a focus, and it barely scratched the surface. And partnering with Disney probably created major barriers in terms of what could/could not be mentioned.   I would have appreciated a whole episode dedicated to the shit that went down on Camp Rock, and then another episode solely focused on Raven's substantial career at the Disney Channel. And a standalone episode JUST talking to Drew Barrymore. That would have allowed more time to get into details.   The people Demi interviewed were child stars at completely different times. Demi also interviewed people from both Nick and Disney. I understand that maybe they were trying to show that the issues persisted throughout the decades, and across networks. But honestly, I am too old to really know who JoJo Siwa is, I never watched anything she was in. So I didn't really engage with JoJo's  interview as much. I feel like it would've been better if the doc really focused on one period of time, like QOS did. Or at least, make the doc longer, have an episode focus on a person or a time period.   I think it lacked focus. QOS focused on a specific period of time, (90s-00s), at Nickelodeon. This doc was all over the place. I would appreciate a doc JUST focused on Disney. Get more former Disney child stars in, if possible.  My FINAL gripe with this doc is that Demi partnered with Disney. I am 99% sure THAT'S why the doc didn't get into everything. Maybe they did that because Raven is still working for Disney, and might have a conflict of interest? The doc also used clips from the old TV shows so obviously, working with Disney allows them to use those clips.  The one thing I liked about this is that it demonstrated the abuse of child stars throughout history and it looked to the future/influencers, and legislative changes to protect kids now and in future. (Again, it could've done this in way more detail).",belgeselsever,1k51nhb

"I feel like we dont understand Schneider, he dislikes kids. I want to be clear, he IS an horrible person but I don't think he is a person who love kids. He dislikes kids, everything he does is egomaniacal. Now, ""misunderstand him"" doesn't make him better in no way... what he did is horrible. He is racist, machist, treat workers as slaves... probably what I think about him is worse than what most of people think about him. But people think he do likes kids, I don't think... I think he detest kids. Both Josh and Del Figgalo are his ""mini me"". I think he did child drama because his childhood was a mess. His parents were cool, he wasn't; his parents thought he was a looser; he was the classic fat guy bullied... that's why he did those child dramas with those toxic components. That's why he wasn't caring about toxic people, he cared about his own power toward kids. Probably early time he was genuine with kids, probably early time he was liking those kids... then he saw them and he started to feel jealous. With Amanda I don't think is sexual, I think he is trying to stealing her fame and use her as tool of power. Is even more toxic what he is to me.",belgeselsever,1kdn4gx

"Im curious why Charlie Sheen isn’t looked at more? Everything Corey Feldman said has been true. Corey Feldman also named Charlie Sheen as a sexual abuser. The dude has a famous family and grew up in Hollywood. He has a lot of connections.      We all know he’s done some crazy things. But it’s often brushed off as “oh that’s just Charlie sheen, being Charlie sheen.”   Though consensual, he also had sex with Soleil Moon Frye when she was 18 and he was 29. But look at that age gap and how she just becomes legal.   Furthermore, Brian Peck was an actor and dialogue coach for a long time on Anger Management.   How is there no documentary exposing him or his crazy lifestyle? He literally was sleeping around knowing he was HIV positive. That alone is illegal and shows you a peak into how he just doesn’t give a fuck.",belgeselsever,1cf9anc

"The part about Joe Bell not being heard & told he must be homophobic I'm a gay man and I wanted to comment on this - it sickens me that Drake Bell's dad was told he was being homophobic when he tried to speak up about Brian's innappropriate behavior  First of all, I want to talk to whoever this unnamed woman was that said this to Joe. Presumably she was straight, because no queer person would think a 40 year old man touching a 15 year old boy is ""just a gay person being gay"". Gay men being touchy and flamboyant is a stereotype, and it sickens me that whoever that woman was, made Joe feel bad for pointing out something that was clearly wrong. Had that person that Joe spoke to been a gay man, he would not have been shrugged off.  I want to say, loudly, that pedophiles are not gay. Pedophiles like children. It does not matter what gender the children they target are. They are predators, and I hate when pedophile men who abuse boys are called gay. Some people might argue with me about this, but I want to strip pedophiles of the right to describe themselves as gay, or include themselves in any way in my community.  Pedophiles who like little boys like them because of the power they can have over them. That is not being gay. Normal gay men want healthy, consenting sex and/or relationships with people their age, just like straight people. Pedophiles want to abuse vulnerable victims. That's what they like.  Keep your children safe. No matter the child's gender. Adults should not want to be friends with children. No matter what gender the adult is. Normal gay men don't touch children. Normal gay men don't want to be friends with children. If a monster like Brian Peck touches a little boy's arm, he is not doing it because he's gay, he's doing it because he is a pedophile.  Pedophiles like Brian Peck have made it seem like us gay men are dangerous. No. Gay men are not dangerous. Pedophiles are dangerous. Normal adults, queer or not, don't want anything innappropriate to do with kids.",belgeselsever,1chszj6

"Let's talk basic human decency I've seen numerous, I mean NUMEROUS people online saying Drake telling his story is a PR campaign to restart his career.  I can't fathom how far removed someone must be from human emotions and basic decency to even suggest something this vile.  The way I see it is:   This is his way of reclaiming his story after so many online speculations and so many gossip videos claiming to ""expose"" his dark past. As if it is something that needs exposing.   Let us all be reminded that he tried asking for a video outing his trauma to be taken down, to no avail.   Telling his story was his own decision, but in a way, he was pressured into it throughout the years, so publicly.   He'd gone through extensive therapy and finally, he was ready to tell his story the way it was supposed to be told.   And it was the QoS team that approached him, not the other way around.  Oh, but he released a song right after?   Big deal. He had been writing songs after songs about his trauma, forever.   The only difference is, this time, people understand.   I imagine he must have been eager to finally be heard because no one had ever understood what he was trying to say before.  There are so many ways to interpret a situation; I don't know why people must assume the worst.   There are more good in people than you might think.   Your words have consequences and right now, they are hurting a real, vulnerable person who's actively trying to heal after concealing the trauma he endured for so long.   This is real life, not some juicy drama to entertain our tired, fried-up brains.",belgeselsever,1cc3gvu
"Friendly reminder that playing abuse detective hurts victims I get that this documentary has rightfully got people energised about protecting children in the industry. And that is great if we want to see change. But, I’m starting to see a worrying trend of people speculating on who else might be a victim.   I get you want your favourite stars to see justice, but this isn’t the way. There are only two possible outcomes to this and neither are good. One you are completely wrong and the person you thought was a victim has to spend energy denying it, and possibly making it harder for actual victims to come forward. If you are slinging accusations left and right that means people are less likely to take legit accusations serious. And two is even worse. You are right and the victim then gets hounded to tell their story when they aren’t ready and are then retraumaised. Victims get to be in charge in of their own narrative. It isn’t your responsibility or place to decide when they are ready to come forward.   If you want to do something there are a ton of practical ways you can actually make a difference and help victims rather than hurting them. Donate or volunteer at your local sexual assault advocacy group. Compile a list of organisations the help victims that you can give to someone if they ever come to you in crisis. Start petitions advocating for stricter regulations on child protections on set and send them to SAG. And finally support those who have come forward.",belgeselsever,1cgrmds
"Stop Playing Armchair Detective The amount of ""X must be traumatized"" or ""Y needs to speak out"" or ""this joke might vaguely be an innuendo"" or ""if your mind is dirty enough this could be a penis"" posts are weird.           It is not your right to state someone has been traumatized. That includes Amanda.          If is not your right to tell someone else's story.          It is not your right to speculate on who or who wasn't a victim. These are the victims right. It is also their right to remain silent.              Then there is the ""This might be a sexual joke of you squint hard enough, notice the thing that was there for half a second, and have a dirty mind."" No, ATM isn't a sexual acronym.

Yes, kids cartoons has have had adult jokes that you didn't notice as a kid. Why? Because they were designed that way for your parents who back then, would watch with you instead of handing a toddler an iPad and calling it a day.

"Brian Peck only actually served less than 4 months in prison So yesterday me and some people (who can understand this stuff much better than me) were looking at Brian Peck's case on the official California case records website. According to these dates, BP was first sentenced on June 23, 2004. His lawyers seem to have fought this sentence once a month, and then on October 7, 2004, there was a final sentencing hearing where the set bail was dropped and a new date was set to discuss how BP was going to go about paying Drake the $200 in compensation. When someone is in jail, they cannot pay someone money, and bail gets dropped when someone is released, so that means he was released on October 7th. The 2nd image are comments made by the judge. If anyone is a legal expert and wants to add to this feel free. But basically Drake said in 1 interview BP only served ""maybe 4 months"" and he's right. Yet, no one has really discussed this fact. They just see ""sentenced to 16 months"" and assume he served the whole thing. So I feel like we gotta make some noise about this.",belgeselsever,1cyyw2m

We knew Brian was fucking him. My dad LAUGHED at it. Brian’s got another one!!  >Then encouraged us to go to Brian’s parties.

It's people getting damaged like that. Ngl, I'm kinda happy these shows are off the air. Even if I liked them as a kid. Even if I had fondness and it reminded me about the good times in my life. Now. I don't get these feeling of nostalgia. Instead I just think about how much pain these people are! If things were done better I would look back fondly but no! Dan and his douche bag friends are involved and ruined it for not just the writers and actors but all the people who grew up on these shows.

"Diddy and Bieber I know this isn’t technically QOS related, but I wanted to ask for your thoughts on the situation.   From what Diddy is being exposed for, the abuse, manipulation, sex trafficking, black mail, etc, I keep seeing talks of Diddy also getting involved with children. Justin Bieber has been talked about lately and that he was allegedly SA'd by people in the industry. Now, there is no out right damming evidence for this. The only proof being his music video for Yummy giving subliminal messages and a questionable video of Odell and Justin.       This all just makes me go back to the situation with Drake Bell and the actions he took following the abuse. The mental breakdown, the drug use, the outbursts and abuse. It’s similar to Bieber’s decline a few years ago. And there was not much evidence for Drake being abused before he came forward besides some insider talk.   I see a lot of people online fully convinced Justin was sexually abused, but I also see the other side of people saying Bieber’s name is just being dragged into Diddy’s mess with no evidence to prove it happened.   What do you guys think? Do you think Justin Bieber has been abused in this industry in more ways than we think? I wouldn’t put it past the typical dirty dark hollywood.

"For those who blamed Drake Bell's mother, this is the speech of a loving mother in pain who was deceived and manipulated.. and did everything she could to help her son once she found out the truth Ms. Robin Dodson:  I'm here today for my son and I'm also here for myself. I know it's going to be difficult, but I couldn't allow this day to come and go without our voices being heard.  Your honor, I know that you have letters of support from people who have-who think they know Brian, however, I wonder how many of those people would have written their letter if Brian had molested their son. My guess is none. And if someone told me three years ago that I'd be standing here in front of this man, I wouldn't have believed it. My letter would have been on top of theirs.  Brian portrayed himself as a friend. I talked to him often, every day. He was a real caring guy. He caught me and my son completely off guard. He broke my son down piece by piece. He manipulated him with his lures and his tricks, all of his friends. He partied him and made it a fun deal. Worse than anything, Brian used me. He used me to get to my son. When I think back and the phone would ring and I'd answer it and Brian would want to talk to my son, he was in his bedroom and he was saying, ""No, Mom. I don't want to talk to him. Stop calling him."" My son tried so hard to stay away from Brian, but Brian got to me. He had me totally convinced. He told me that my son wasn't working hard enough. I didn't know this business and I wanted to help my son and Brian convinced me that without him that my son's career wouldn't be anything. I believed every single lie, so I forced my son to continue working with him. I thought I was helping him and my son thought he was protecting me by not telling me the truth. He didn't want me to have to hear what was really happening. Brian also manipulated my son into feeling like the abuse was his own fault, that he wanted it and that if he told anyone, no one would believe him, and he got that right. So my son tried to bury this nightmare inside just like you thought he would, Brian. You had him so twisted, he often thought that I would be mad at him, that he was the one that needed to be punished. How dare you?  Hopefully one day my son will understand he was a young kid and you seduced and you manipulated him and every one of your friends. You deceived him and you deceived every grown adult that you trust-that trusts you. Brian, you called me-All those phone calls telling me to keep my son away from his girlfriend. Do you remember that, Brian? You said, ""Robin, all she wants to do is have sex with him."" But ""sex"" wasn't the word, remember that, Brian? Remember that lie? I do. It was the ""F"" word, which wasn't fit for this courtroom and it wasn't fit for me either. But you remember those lies, Brian? Do you? And now I know why you wanted my son to stay away from his girlfriend, because you wanted him for yourself. Again, you used me and I believed you, every sick lie you dished out.  After the abuse my son asked me if he could talk to a professional. It was hard for him to see a psychiatrist. He couldn't tell me why. And during those appointments he couldn't even get it out. He was unable to speak about what Brian did to him. He held it inside another year. He was only 15. You knew what he was going through. You used it. He had no one to help him. No one he could talk to. He was alone with the filthy memories that you dealt him. He has had such depression, such fits of outrage because of the things you did to him. You've done terrible damage to a wonderful kid.   How you can even defend yourself here sickens me. You're guilty of repeated crimes against him. And God forbid that your money can keep you out of prison. Brian, you have no idea how much courage it took my son to come forward and tell you-and tell what you did, but he had to do it. He had to do it for himself and to make sure you could never do it to another young boy. He knew that if he kept quiet you could go on to seduce and trap another kid in your perversion. I heard my son say with strength in his voice, ""Brian Peck, you messed with the wrong kid."" He knew he had to stand up against you for what you did to him. So, your honor, my son took the first step. He talked to me. He told me enough to know that Brian Peck did things to him that were horrific, that were shameful, that were criminal. My son couldn't look the other way any longer. He had to do what no one else was able to do, report a pedophile. After he told me, I took the next step. I didn't just call the police. I called many different police stations. I knew I needed to find specialists, and I did. I was referred to the Los Angeles Police Department sexually exploited child unit. I wanted to make sure I did everything right because I didn't want to let my son down. I knew that I was dealing with Brian Peck, a man who is very calculated and deceitful. I also knew that Brian had the financial backing to try and escape a prison term, and I knew he would use his family's money to hire the best lawyer he could in order to escape a real punishment. But I refuse to allow that to happen. I know it's not my decision, your honor, but I wanted to do everything I could to help my son complete the journey that he took such agonizing steps to start. I made the phone call to the police and the officers were in our home within 45 minutes and, for the first time, my son was able to tell exactly what had happened to him. My son realized he'd been victimized and he knew he had to make sure it never happened to another young boy.  Brian, your lies and your deceit and your sexual perversion has devastated my son's life and mine and after all this time the full repercussions are yet to be determined. You hurt my son, Brian. And that you cannot fix. All of the perverted memories will live in his head for the rest of his life. He has told me, ""Mom, I can't stand the silence of being alone."" The thoughts haunt him.There is rage inside him. And then there are times that he feels stupidity. He feels he should have been able to escape your con and careful seduction. But if you look around, no one else could. This may be the most difficult part for him to heal. I told him Brian Peck is an expert at doing what he has done. ""You were a trusting child. He was a slick, adult manipulator. It wasn't fair."" He was tricked by a pedophile to service his sexual perversions.  And then there are other times when my son has misplaced anger, when he'd yell at me that it was my fault because I did not protect him. I have to live with that because it is true. But Brian, what I will never live with is my son ever feeling like it was his fault because, Brian, you baited him, you used me, you got to him. How dare you? You went in for the kill.  This experience has been the most horrible thing that has ever happened in my son's life or mine. At least I am standing here thankful that you've been caught and hopefully you've been stopped. Your honor, please know that my son trusts you. He trusts you to make this matter right. He has been waiting a long time for this day to come and I'm asking that you don't slap Brian Peck on the wrist. If you do that, you tell my son that what Brian did to him was no big deal. Please don't do that. Don't let him get hurt again. Please show Brian Peck that he can't walk away from his terrible crimes simply because he seems charming and has the money to hire a good lawyer and is capable of deceiving everyone. For my son to heal, he needs to see Brian Peck punished, not just slapped on the wrist. And now my son and I have done all we can to seek justice, and I'm asking you, your honor, please take the next step.  Thank you.

"Charlie Sheen and Brian Peck don't know if people talked about this already... I came across an old article from DailyMail from 2013 where they talk about Charlie Sheen and his trip to Scotland with ""his friend Brian Peck"" without mentioning his crimes. This was before the documentary ""an open secret"" came out. I also looked up old tweets from Charlie Sheen and others from 2013/2014... I know that many people were not aware of the situation back then, but it's still baffling that no one in the replys knew anything. Nobody thought it was suspicious?!

"Recognizing Brian Peck's voice is really scary I made a throwaway account for this.  I used to live kind of close to Brian Peck, same few blocks. Los Angeles is a humongous city. Even Van Nuys is a pretty big neighborhood. The few blocks where Brian Peck lives are actually pretty close-knit and everyone is kind of familiar with each other.  It's next to a park. A group of senior citizens brings their dogs every evening. They talk to everyone who passes by. Everyone makes small talk with each other. When strangers are walking by, people talk to them.  Of course I'm overgeneralizing when I say ""everyone,"" but overall that was the feel of that neighborhood.  I moved out in 2019, way before *Quiet on Set*. I think everyone around there knew of Brian Peck. We didn't know the details, but we all had a general idea what happened. It was available online.  Of course there were tons of rumors about other possible victims, people Brian Peck had brought home, and so on. I don't think it helps anyone to talk about that stuff without permission from victims or at least more evidence.  My guess is that Brian Peck probably doesn't go out much these days, but back then he used to go on evening walks quite often. He'd talk on the phone. The first time I saw him, it gave me chills because it felt like I was seeing Boo Radley. Then I saw him a few more times and it got boring. I think he could tell when people were creeped out by him. I never talked to him.  I mean to say that when I saw him for the first time, I didn't say anything but my natural reaction was probably to make a face that said ""holy shit, is that who I think it is? this is so weird."" Brian Peck probably got that a lot and recognized it.  He also played into the creepiness. Back then, he kept an animal skull decoration on his front lawn. He probably still has that.  I recently saw *the Willies*, just because I wanted to look for subliminal messages (it has a few), and that scene gave me chills. In *The Willies*, there's one scene in which a reporter stars talking but you can't see their face yet. You can only hear their voice. It's a seriously weird moment of ""where do I know that voice from again? oh yeah,"" and it's Brian Peck.  I can only imagine how scary it must be to hear Brian Peck's voice for one his victims.",belgeselsever,1cl35ii

"Drake Bell/ Richard Gadd I know these aren’t the only two people that have been in this scenario, but if you watched “Baby Reindeer”, did anybody else immediately start thinking about Drake Bell/Brian Peck during EP 4?   A lot of similarities popped into my head while watching:  - The hopes of the Drake & Josh spin-off vs. Gadd’s comedic writing career, and not wanting to ruin it   - Substance abuse, alcohol/drugs with a “trusted mentor”  - Denying the first inappropriate incident and going back in fear of being discarded, replaced, or forgotten   - returning after the assault but not understanding why they’re going against their judgment   - the feeling of losing their self-autonomy (Ik this is common for survivors)   My heart breaks for both of them and anyone that has remotely been in situations like this. As I watched the scene, I couldn’t help but to recall Drake explaining his experience. I know many people resonated with that ep (the hotline at the end reported that they had a ~ 90% increase in phone calls after the show aired). I cannot imagine what I feels like to both be seen/represented but also triggered at the same time.",belgeselsever,1ck3xmt

Yelling at cast and crew to the point where the girls where afraid of her and had panic attacks   How inappropriate Abby was with children still blows my mind such as her forcibly kissing Maddie and giving 9-11 year olds G-STRINGS as a Christmas present and may many more inappropriate Behaviours  There’s so much more I could put but it’s an absolute rabbit hole   This really goes to show that there this industry is full of dans and their still at large,belgeselsever,1ceqdll

"Brian Peck apparently worked with Amanda Bynes on What I like About You in 2003 and also in 2004's Lovewrecked after he served his sentence. I just saw this very interesting comment on another subreddit and thought I would share it here....  The ""What I Like About You"" disconnect is interesting. It's not widely documented but Brian Peck also worked on ""What I Like About You"" alongside Dan (credited as a guest in two episodes and can be seen on set in behind the scenes footage). 2003 is when it all seems to kick off. Amanda goes back to Nickelodeon in July 2003 to judge on ""R U All That"" alongside her then boyfriend Taran Killam.  Taran would stay on with Nickelodeon to write for ""All That"", but Amanda and Taran broke up, and Amanda started seeing Nick Zano in the months after he joined ""What I Like About You"" in August. Also in August of 2003 was when Brian Peck was arrested for [Lewd Acts with a Child]( Amanda told CosmoGirl that her brief relationship with Zano helped her move on from with Killam, with Amanda later joining a charity that helped teenage girls who are victims of relationship abuse where she spoke of her own experiences of how she had been in a relationship with a controlling guy.  Dan was officially announced to be leaving ""What I Like About You"" as show runner at the end of production on the show's second season in Feb 2004, alongside Wil Calhoun (Wil would co-write the show's Second Season finale with future show runner Caryn Lucas as his parting gift).  April 2004, Amanda turned 18 and had a joint birthday party with Jennie Garth, all of their ""What I Like About You"" cast mates in attendance (including her ex-boyfriend Nick Zano), some crew, her parents. Notably absent... Dan Schneider.   June 2004, Amanda films the movie ""LoveWrecked"" in the Dominican Republic. Who else is somehow inexplicably cast in this movie...? Brian Peck.  When Amanda returns to film ""What I Like About You"" in August 2004, she's noticeably thinner, but it's reportedly because she contracted Mononucleosis whilst in the Dominican Republic.  That's all I have. I too would like someone to do a ""What I Like About You"" deep dive, because clearly sketchy stuff happened. In the only Dan Schneider penned episode from Season 1, Amanda jumps into a mud bath with an adult woman and massages her foot. Nuff said!",belgeselsever,1hcey2t

Whenever little me asked her why my momma would just said ""I just think it's best you don't. I know it may look fun to be a child star, but I'm just looking out for you with the best intentions.""

"Quiet on Set interview cut scenes Currently on episode 2 of the documentary. Was watching from a German source when suddenly the English subtitles weren't lining up and when I switched to an English source of the documentary, I came to find out an interview was cut.   When Brandi's mom is talking about Jason messaging Brandi, before she talks about him emailing the picture to her, she talks about how he would message her on AIM. One day he told her that they should meet up, so she should tell her mom to drop her off at the local mall and he would meet her there. And that she shouldn't tell her mom she's meeting him there. Brandi's mom says she didn't do anything about that except say of course she's not going to the mall. Then it follows with the part about the email with the picture (which isn't cut).  I wonder why they decided to cut the AIM part for American audiences. I'd imagine because it puts a negative light on Brandi's mom for not going to authorities at that point.  Anyway - wondering if anyone knows of other cut bits",belgeselsever,1cnapx0

"Dan's adult ""jokes"" You know what I noticed? Why isn't the adult characters doing these so called adult jokes in these shows. I never see Spenser or any other adult character say innuendos but the minors. It's always the minors in these shows. Dan almost exclusively having minors do these adult ""jokes"" is very suspicious.   Also let's address this elephant in the room. There's nothing wrong with an adult joke or two in a kids show. There's nothing wrong with universal appeal and to get as much people to enjoy and appreciate something. HOWEVER! It is HOW it's done that is either funny or sick. Let's take something like Shrek or SpongeBob. They like to throw in adult jokes. However what they do is they use cheeky word play and make what they are joking about very hidden and something you can easily miss. Also ADULTS ARE MAKING THESE JOKES! Both the voice actors and the characters canonical age!   Wanna know how you do this wrong? Dans sitcoms! They are on the nose! Barely any subtly or clever word play. Dan has minors telling these ""jokes"" They might be framed as cometic but they are clearly just an excuse to have Dan shove his fetishes in our faces. Lastly. The adults in these shows never really tell these jokes! It's always the 13 year olds!   I wanted to address this elephant as this is a sick thing I noticed.",belgeselsever,1cuv94n

"So what do we do now? What steps should the industry take moving forward to protect child actors?  Here are some of my suggestions.  Background checks on all employees, volunteers and sub contractors. If they wouldn't be able to get a job at a school they shouldn't be able to get a job on set.   A neutral person should be provided on set to advocate for the child.  Somewhat similar to the intimacy coordinators role that has been created in the wake of me too. This person should be like a guardian ad lidem in legal proceedings who has the child's best interests at heart. They should be on set whenever the child is.  Or maybe more of a social worker type role whos paycheck is not tied to production or to the child.    Kissing scenes for minors should be between minors. It's wild to me that 26 year olds where kissing 14 year olds on set. These scenes should be discussed with the intimacy coordinator to empower the actors and give them confidence and support.   The same way other safety briefs are given at the start of the day when they mention today there will be guns or animals on set, it should be discussed if minors will be on set. And announcements made when the minors arrive on set. I think this will just prevent children overhearing things they shouldn't.  Any more I haven't thought of? What suggestions would you make for a safer environment for children?",belgeselsever,1ce8w7i

"On Bryan Hearne I know this is mostly my rambling about this situation; but it broke my heart into a million pieces when Bryan Hearne discussed what he was put through during his time on Nickelodeon, but he endured it because he wanted to ‘get his family out of the hood.’  That Fear Factor thing with the peanut butter… that was a gross violation of his boundaries and disrespect of his basic human dignity.  They could have had the adult actors and producers do the dares and have the kids pick what happens.  I’m sure every kid loves seeing other kids get an adult’s goat. That would have been in the spirit of the ‘kids rule’ era movies and TV like Matilda.  As for the Lil Fetus sketches… they had animators.  Why didn’t they animate something that LOOKS like an ultrasound image and have Bryan voice it?  They could have used the same jokes and spared Bryan the suit that made him look naked.  It hurt to hear Bryan say that, because at one point I employed people who WERE the kids of economically disadvantaged communities.  People like their teachers and school staff didn’t expect much out of these people and never bothered to help them gain a meaningful education.  It was a vicious circle. So when Bryan kept saying he did it to get his family out of the hood… It’s safe to say nobody else ever presented or helped him find a viable path out of poverty.",belgeselsever,1cqt6yo

"So, after watching the documentary, I watched some videos of the infamous SNICK “On-Air Dare” segments online, and… WTF??? Just… *oh my god.* Words cannot express how awful this is. How did this get approved at all??? Like, okay, I get that Nickelodeon’s image at the time was being a more edgy kids’ channel than something like Disney Channel. They weren’t afraid to get gross, hence all the slime in “Double Dare.”  I’m honestly not a big fan of gross-out stuff in general, but grunge made out of vanilla pudding, apple sauce, and green food coloring is one thing. The crap that went on in On-Air Dares is something else entirely. Eating toenails?? Drinking sweat?? Getting covered in raw eggs, worms, cow snot, sour milk, fish guts, etc.?? The fucking peanut butter incident??? Multiple people had to sign off on this, and nobody said no???? Not only is this extremely gross, but plenty of this was just plain unsanitary, and could actually be detrimental to the kids’ health.  It’s been compared to “Fear Factor” many times for good reason, but to be honest, I would say that this was even WORSE than Fear Factor. First, and most obvious, of all, the actors are were all kids. Second: Fear Factor does put its contestants in scary and disgusting situations, but at least the contestants willingly signed up, and if they didn’t want to do a stunt, they could tap out. Plus, if they did all of the challenges, they would win a ton of money. On-Air Dares featured the All That cast, and if what Bryan Hearne was anything to go by, they likely didn’t even have a choice of whether or not they wanted to participate, and they weren’t competing for money, either. It was essentially torturing child actors for the sake of doing it. Having to do such uncomfortable, humiliating, and scary stuff in front of an audience and on camera, no less, all during some of the most formative years of your life can be so damaging, both physically and mentally. I just can’t believe anyone at Nickelodeon allowed Dan Schneider to even *entertain* the concept of a segment like this, let alone how far they allowed the dares to go.   Sorry if I’m not saying anything particularly original here, but I just had to put my thoughts out after watching the segments out of morbid curiosity of just how bad they could get.",belgeselsever,1h0uno6

"A new book on Disney Channel mentions Brian Peck Ashley Spencer has written a book about Disney Channel in the 2000s called ""Disney High."" It comes out next week, but I found and bought a copy yesterday at a local bookstore.  Any fan of series like ""Lizzie McGuire,"" ""Hannah Montana"" and ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" should enjoy Spencer's book. I've already learned that Disney Channel, unlike Nickelodeon, was willing to fire showrunners for the sake of creating a better workplace: Michael Poryes was removed from ""That's So Raven,"" and Danny Kallis was removed from ""The Suite Life on Deck."" (Poryes actually got a second chance and served as co-showrunner of ""Hannah Montana"" for its entire run.)  Speaking of ""The Suite Life,"" the franchise gets its own chapter, and yes, Brian Peck comes up. A quick reminder: Shortly after Peck served jail time, he provided the voice of London Tipton's talking mirror in a handful of episodes of ""The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.  In a comment below, I've included an image of all three paragraphs devoted to this topic. You'll notice that the author blames the hiring of Peck on ""the network"" and not anyone that was part of the show's crew. The author also says that Peck was never on set with other actors, instead providing his vocals during post-production.  Disney Channel executive Adam Bonnett says he doesn't know how Peck got the role, and that if Peck had been considered for an onscreen role, he would've been thoroughly vetted and turned away. (When Bonnett and other executives were made aware of Peck's criminal record, alternate versions of the episodes, with someone else voicing the mirror, were created; these are the versions available to stream on Disney Plus.)  One person who denies being responsible for hiring Peck is Rich Correll, who directed many episodes of the series. You'll recall that Correll and his wife Beth, who was an A.D. on the show, wrote letters defending Peck at the time of his sentencing. Today, they claim they didn't know the truth about Peck.  For what it's worth, the Sprouse twins are both quoted in the book as saying the Corrells created a positive work environment, and Rich says they send Mother's Day cards to Beth every year. (The Sprouse brothers cut ties with their manager, Josh Werkman, in 2008, after Werkman pleaded no contest to misdemeanor child molestation; the case did not involve Dylan or Cole.)

"Drake's dad was accused of mishandling of funds, yet it was the tv production cost cutting on the cast and crew The main events in the documentary revolved around The Amanda show, where the female writers Jenny & Christy, child victims Brandi & Drake and perpetrators Jason & Brian all worked on.  [2007]( New York Times Article mentioning how The Amanda Show was conceived:  >But the turning point in his relationship with the network came after Schneider added to the evolving cast of “All That” a girl named Amanda Bynes. Everyone recognized her as a nascent star, and so the network set about creating a show just for her — without consulting Schneider. The pilot that was shot for this new Bynes vehicle, though, was so poor that the network shelved it and scrapped plans for the series entirely — at which point Schneider felt he had to speak up. “I went to the Nickelodeon executives, and I said: ‘Look, you can’t blame Amanda for that; it was just the wrong project for her. Amanda is such a rangy little actress — she’s like a little Dana Carvey or a little Carol Burnett. What I would have done, if you had come to me, is I would have created a show where she could have played a lot of different characters. More of a sketch-type show.’ So I talked to them for a while and they said O.K., go ahead; and I created ‘The Amanda Show,’ which is one of the most successful shows Nickelodeon has ever had.” (  Quotes from the Quiet on Set Documentary  Joe Bell  >He found an attorney to find out about Drake's financial situation. There was never any mishandling of any funds.  Christy Stratton  >I remember speaking to the line producer and she said that I was going to have to split a salary with a writer that I did not know. So they were getting two for the price of one. They were going to hire two women and have them share a salary. And I never saw it happen to any of the men.  Jenny Kilgen  >I went down to the studio to meet with Dan about Season two. He said, ""Here's the deal. We're bringing you back for Season 2, staff writer. We're offering you a 16-week contract, but you need to work the whole season."" Which was, I believe, 27 weeks. He was telling me I had to work 11 weeks for free.  Karyn Finley Thompson  >One day, I keeled over, and I ended up having to go to the hospital. And, as I'm leaving and curled over, I could hear someone say... ""How is the show going to get finished?"" And I just remember saying, ""I'll be right back!"" ""I'll be right back."" And then, he promised me a job and didn't give it to me. Not only was this job that Dan promised me given to someone else, it was a younger man who had no experience.  Jason Handy  >""You and all the kids are why I work for free half the week""  Also remember how Brian Peck was described as being ""generous with his time."" Did he also take a pay cut like Handy?  \_\_\_  Also according to Jenny on [twitter](  >The female writers were only there for season one and there were no predators there at that time. And we were in a separate building. The predators seem to have arrived when production was moved to NICK on SUNSET.  (Brian Peck appeared on the Amanda Show in the later seasons. IMDB credits him on the ""Face & Zawyer "" episode. And this reddit post said he appeared on [Season 3](  \_\_\_  The payment scheme allegedly carried over to other Nick shows, according to an actress in this [video](  >I remember working for 4 days, and there was some deal with the contract that I would only be paid for 2 of them, which was shitty but I had the most lines and I knew the other girls were being paid worse.  From the [2022]( Business Insider article:  >In his memoir, Josh Peck wrote that he made about $450,000 over five years of filming ""Drake & Josh."" Backstage reported in 2012 that most child-star series regulars earned just $5,000 to $7,000 a week before taxes and expenses, which a parent of three child actors said could reduce weekly take-home pay to a mere $500.  And Drake Bell has talked about not getting residuals during his interview on [The Sarah Fraser Show]( :  >... at my age I didn't know that 50% of my money was going to taxes. And that 10% comes out for my agents and 15% for managers. I mean I knew but you can't calculate in your head. So he was putting in my brain, ""you know Drake you should be rich like you did a commercial that you should have had $250,000 from that. And that your dad's stealing your money. I mean look how much it happens in Hollywood ... on The Amanda Show I mean we weren't making after taxes, management, agents. You know we weren't making crazy amounts of money. We didn't get residuals on Drake and Josh. And we didn't get residuals on the Amanda Show. So we're really hung out to dry.",belgeselsever,1co0jje

Don’t preach Lyrics Listening to anything from telegraph makes me sad but don’t preach in particular is the one that really upsets me. I remember seeing a performance of it a few years ago on YouTube and before singing the song Drake said it was about his dad. I can’t find this clip anywhere but I’m positive it’s true. I’m sure that drake and his dad definitely fought and said hurtful things to each other and we don’t know their relationship and are not entitled to but With the context of QOS and Brian’s manipulation don’t preach just makes me bawl because now lyrics like “you took my money away” and “I’m the one that payed your way” have a different meaning. This song makes me so sad and angry when I listen to it because now all I hear is how Brian strained drake and his dads relationship and just how far his manipulation went.   Edit: don’t preach is still a great song by the way,belgeselsever,1d57bh1
"Dan Schneider shows are so mean-spirited Look at Drake and Josh, iCarly, and Victorious. in Drake and Josh, josh constantly gets treated like shit by the world and has to suffer so much just for being a good person. Meanwhile drake and megan always have positive things happen to them (especially Megan) even though they're awful people. It's the same with iCarly where Sam is straight up abusive towards Freddie and constantly gets away with it. And in Victorious, half the humor comes from the characters insulting each other. I personally find it unfunny and annoying. Many disney sitcoms after suite life of zack and cody were also very mean-spirited which is probably due to aspects of these shows being influenced by dan schneider shows. Before suite life of zack and cody, disney sitcoms weren't that mean-spirited. In fact, Thats so raven is probably the least mean-spirited kids sitcom imo.",belgeselsever,1elqrnl

"Big Fat Liar written by Dan Schneider I know this topic has died down, but I want to make this post for anyone still interested. Big Fat Liar was a film that Dan Schneider and the head of Nickelodeon at the time Brian Robbins. This was at a time when Amanda bynes was trying to get into film & Dan wrote this role for her. Which is kind of sick considering what the movie is about. A pompous movie director (Marty wolf) steals a story a kid wrote and turns it into a movie script, which seems like an innocent enough plot line, but the whole movie is essentially the director teling the kid ""this is how Hollywood works, tell anyone anything you like about what I did, they won't believe you anyway"". And that's essentially what happened to Amanda. Paul giamatti gives a great performance and in my opinion spent enough time around Dan to pick up his mannerisms and really embody him. There's a scene where someone on the film crew asks Marty for a day off for his granddaughters birthday, and Marty freaks out on him and is extremely cruel. This is when I realized I wasn't just making up some far fetched theory, this movie was some thinly veiled confession, or more so a sneak diss to his victims. There's a story one of victims tells on Quiet on Set that was exactly like this scene. Even worse there's a deleted casting couch scene that is extremely damning and inappropriate for a children's movie. You can find that on YouTube. As the plot progresses we learn that Marty has been mistreating people left and right in the industry, so frankie Munoz and Amanda bynes get all these people he's wronged together to expose Wolf. Essentially the ""quiet on set"" moment. All eyes on Dan.   The subtext is everything.   It adds another layer of mental abuse I think should be considered, especially when you hear him ""apologize"" or anything like that. He meant what he did. And Marty wolf shows us that.  ""We got dogs eating dogs. Cats eating cats. Fish munchin fish.""  Edit: forgot to add, in Quiet on Set we learn that Brian Peck had an obsession with John Wayne Gacy and even corresponded with him through letters. In the film, Marty Wolf becomes a clown... like John Wayne Gacy. It's a big inside joke to them.  &&&&  The actors described visiting Pecks house as this wacky place with toys and odd things. Marty's home, revealed in the third act, is similar to this description.",belgeselsever,1di48n5

I find it interesting that it didn’t take much for him to confess he did something wrong over the phone, even if it could’ve been just a ruse to get Drake to drop it.

"Please don’t underestimate the work it takes to make a docuseries like this There’s currently a post on here about the Emmy nominations that QoS has received. Some of the people who have left comments seem to think that A) the producers don’t deserve those nominations, and B) the interviewees (well, the former child stars) deserve nominations as well.  The second point can be refuted with one sentence: These nominations go to the people who made the series, not all the people who agreed to appear in it. If any of the interviewees had also served as a producer, they would now have a nomination as well.  As for the people who have argued the first point: You don’t actually think that making this series was as simple as pointing a camera at some people, do you  First of all, just tracking down all those people, and getting them to agree to be interviewed on the record was a big logistical feat. If getting an interview like that with Drake Bell was easy, don’t you think it would’ve happened a long time ago? (An Open Secret couldn’t pull it off.)  Which reminds me: After all those people were booked, the actual interviews had to be conducted. None of those people just sat down and started spilling their guts. That’s not how it works. This is a good time to acknowledge all of the research that had to happen beforehand.  And then, there’s the long editing/post-production process. It’s not just a matter of trimming the interviews, it’s tracking down the clips that everyone mentioned, and having archival photos and documents to include. None of that was on Google Image for their convenience.  Of course, any criticism that the series merits can also be directed to the filmmakers. And let’s not forget, this docuseries was produced for a network (Discovery ID) that specializes in sensationalized work. It was produced with the intention of generating attention, and it did that. I’m sorry to any interviewees who maybe didn’t know that going into the project. (I’m also sorry if they weren’t invited to participate in “For Your Awards Consideration” events.)

"I recently remembered what Brian Peck’s film debut was… [I am aware someone briefly mentioned this on this sub before, but I wanted to go into further detail about it.]  It was the 1982 teen/cult classic movie, “The Last American Virgin” (Tbh, I enjoy this movie and its soundtrack even more. (I’m a big fan of ‘80s teen movies, btw.) Besides some gross teenage hormone-related scenes, it has funny and memorable moments, so it aged decently, I guess, but not as well as, say, Pretty in Pink.) )   Keep in mind, this movie was a sex comedy about three teenage boys trying to lose their virginity. I would say this as a debut foreshadows both him as a person and the rest of his career. (Though this was a common trope for teen movies at the time).   I also remembered that Kimmy Robertson (one of his close friends and someone who is disgusting for having supported him (and probably still does) ) was in the movie, and they met on the set of this movie (as shown in the letter I will upload below) and have known each other for more than 40 years, if they’re still in contact with each other.

When he was telling his story I just thought like, if she wouldn't have pulled him into the other room and asked what was happening, would he have continued to think the behavior was ""normal""? That's a terrifying thought. Having raised many kids, most who aren't my own blood even, I feel like there's a maternal instinct where you just know. It makes me so sad knowing his mother didn't even bat an eye at these ""sleyesterday.  I feel so bad, because these people really failed this kid. I know he was charged with some stuff as an adult, which is disgusting. But whenever he was talking, I just saw the child that I grew up watching. It saddened me so much.

"If season 2 of QOS were to happen, and it was Disney Channel stars instead of Nickelodeon child stars, who from the Disney Channel would you want to see tell their story? There is a possibility for a season 2 of Quiet on Set; the season 1team said they're willing to do as many seasons of this as necessary. They're just waiting for the OK from HBO.    Fans of QOS are speculating which Nickelodeon stars would be on, thinking it should be the adults on the shows like Jerry Trainor or Cooper Barnes, who tried to protect the younger cast member.

I guess it was made clear that Martha didn’t have anyone else and therefore became obsessive when someone was slightly nice to her (as shown in the end when she revealed her parents neglected her) where as Peck had other people who kept secrets for them and were enabled all while knowing their true colors.

"Cultural conditions in the late 90s. Who else remembers what it was like? Watched *Quiet on Set* yesterday and it took me right back to Southern California in the late 90s. I was 16 in 1998, and had won a scholarship to a performing arts school near LA. Like some of the parents say in the documentary, my parents weren't sure about entrusting me to a group of adults in a foreign country (I'm from the UK), but they did because they wanted me to have the best career chances.  I'm glad to say I didn't suffer abuse like some of these poor people - I was particularly moved by Drake Bell's story - but there was an incident with my main teacher/mentor which could have gone down the same path, and I just want to reaffirm some of the cultural conditions mentioned in the documentary that made it so much easier for abusers to get away with their actions.  1) Moral standards were lax by comparison with today.  The whole adult in-jokes thing than Dan Schneider found funny was quite normal in the late 90s. When I went to my mentor's home one time, for example, he'd 'accidentally' left a sex toy out on the coffee table in the lounge.  2) Children only had a weak sense of the need to tell another adult if an adult is being inappropriate with them.   So what happened with my mentor was someone hacked my email and sent him a message saying I was in love with him (and he's gay). So when I turned up to my lesson next he was unusually nice to me all lesson (he was a miserable twat at all other times), then at the end he said, 'I appreciated your email by the way'. When I said I didn't know what he was talking about he genuinely looked crestfallen,and said, 'But I know you're gay...' (I am gay, incidentally, but that wasn't the point at the time). What he SHOULD have done is report my email to higher members of faculty, and they could have dealt with it. So I don't know what he was hoping if I'd given in and gone along with what he was saying.  3) There were no safe internet spaces where you could share your experiences with other teens and get advice.  The internet was the wild west at the time. If you went on an Alta Vista chat room (who remembers that?!) you were just as likely to meet a paedophile as you would a potential friend. I'm not joking. But we all just accepted that's how it was. As with all new technology, it's taken a while for the internet to grow up. Apparently when photography was invented some of the very first images to be produced were pornographic.

Did Kimmy Robertson likely write the letter supporting Brian Peck after working on Drake & Josh? Drake had already filmed the skit with Brian Peck for All That before his arrest in August but the episode only aired on 25 October 2003. This is the clip:  [  Four episodes later an episode with Drake aired on 10th January 2004 featuring clips from Drake & Josh as promo. The first episode of Drake & Josh aired 11th January 2004.  Am I right in thinking that Kimmy likely wrote the letter after working with Drake on Drake & Josh? This would be the same for Taran Killam.

"Odd that Beverly Randolph didn't write a letter considering she's still close with Brian Beverly Randolph is an actress from the film The *Return of the Living Dead* (1985), she was 20 years old when they filmed this movie, and Brian Peck was 24 years old when they filmed this movie.   She plays the character ""*Tina*"" in the movie.    For the last 30+ years she's still been friends with, and kept in contact with Brian Peck, her and other members of the ROTLD cast would go to conventions and I assume that before QOS dropped, Brian would also be there.   In 2011 she and Brian did a video together touring some of the old ROTLD locations for a documentary about Return of the Living Dead, the video used to be on youtube but now this screengrab is the only proof it existed at all unless someone reuploaded it somewhere.     There's a couple of photos of them together on her page and the featured photo on her profile is actually her and Brian in zombie makeup, like she's proudly displaying the fact that she still hangs around this wretched POS, also Beverly was a member of the fan group on Facebook for Return and I found this comment from 2009 really funny..     Gee, I wonder why Brian isn't on social media....   It's weird because they are obviously close and she posted this photo from 2021 of them literally hanging out, and she's known him since they were in their 20s, but she didn't write a letter of support?

"Watched the Documentary I just recently watched Quiet On The Set. Here is my review: Shocking, Provocative, Bravery, Tragedy. My ❤️ goes out to everyone who were affected, whether you were violated or not. First & foremost an apology should made to all the male & female stars who were put through the rings of hell courtesy of Dan, Jason, Brian, and others who were co-conspirators. These shows are designed for children, not to masquerade for an SNL/Sitcom on TGIF audience. It's also misleading. Second, Don't say diversity is important when you limit the amount of non white cast members in a series. Either you do it right or not at all. This is some borderline Harvey Weinstein type of shit. Third, The adult women who worked there behind the scenes are also due for an apology. The women are there to work not to be objects of desire. Dan & Harvey deserve each other. Shout out Drake Bell and the others. You all will be saving lives, like others before you. Off the record The Simpsons Beavis & Butthead South Park Futurama & Family Guy do not deserve the crap they've been getting considering how these old shows from Nickelodeon have been re-examined.",belgeselsever,1dfi5sx

"Accessing Sentencing Transcripts I've been interested in accessing the sentencing transcripts from Brian Peck's October 7th, 2004 hearing, reading the victim impact statements from Drake and family, etc. The closest we have to access is this NYT article, in which they paraphrase the transcripts: [   Honestly, I don't think this article is great, because it skips over important quotes (i.e., Drake's mother turning and addressing the supporters present).   I was actually in town, and tried to access the case through a kiosk in a Los Angeles Superior Courtroom. Sadly, I wasn't able to view the sentencing transcript from the kiosk...not sure if it would make a difference if I attempted to do it in the Van Nuys West Courthouse, where the sentencing actually occurred.   It WAS interesting to see summaries of the court's decision in 2023, to release the letters of support. Brian Peck hired a lawyer to go to court and argue against the release of the letters. I can't imagine what kind of argument his representation could have come up with, given that he was the DEFENDANT in the trial, and the letters are supposed to be public record. Again, I would love to see the judgment paperwork, but the terminal didn't have them for viewing. In the summary, it was stated that the victim's name would be redacted, and then released to both Drake AND BP.   Weird, it looked like back in 2004 that BP petitioned to serve his sentence in the Santa Ana County jail, which is honestly a fucking shithole. I don't know why anyone would want to move there.   I also wonder what BP's time in jail/prison was like. He did 3, almost 4 full months in the pokey, and had his lawyers make appeals every month he was in there, to try and get out early or whatever. I don't know which prison he was confined to, but it would be interesting to know how he fared in the day-to-day.  Anyone had any luck accessing the actual sentencing transcripts?",belgeselsever,1f3ozej

Brian Peck was notably convicted of child sex crimes in 2005 and notoriously would  openly discuss his correspondence with the infamous serial killer of young men, John Wayne Gacy while  he was on death row. He also received paintings from him. If records exist of these paintings, I am  requesting those as well.

"Victorious wasn't a good show Even as a preteen, the dialogue and jokes always felt forced, cringy, repetitive, and gross to me. And I frankly cannot fathom how people manage to listen to Cat's voice for more than two minutes without shutting off the TV. Cat Valentine in the final two seasons is infinitely insufferable and calling her annoying is the understatement of the century. It's astonishing that Cat of all characters received her own spinoff.  One of the show's major flaws is the writers having the belief that characters being dickheads = funny. This was also a noticeable issue in other Dan Schneider shows. Jade being as bitchy as possible for no real reason was rarely funny to me as a kid.  Now I'm in no way denying that this show has positive aspects. The acting is great especially from Liz Gillies, Daniella Monet, and Leon Thomas. I loved the sets and overall aesthetic. And every once in a blue moon this show can actually be funny. But IMHO, this show had more negatives than positives.  I don't mean for my opinions to ruin the show for fans. These are just opinions coming from some random guy on the internet after all. But if you also weren't able to enjoy the show, I'd be interested to know your reasoning for why this show wasn't entertaining to you.

Did Drake get invited for any interviews or big podcasts?   Also, why do you think this topic is still so sensitive? Dan Schneider isn’t as big as he used to be and Brian Peck is just a dialect coach, but why do you think it was harder for this documentary to get attention than, for example, the metoo mouvement?   I know that Drake is the only “bigger star” and other people such as Amanda or Ariana are pure speculation, but didn’t the metoo started with a minor person and then others came forward? Why people are still afraid? From what I got from the letters, the people who supported Brian Peck back then aren’t really major players in the industry or are just forgotten by this point  I’m not the age group for Nickelodeon anymore, but I’ve thought it was still a big kid channel.

"Do you think child stars are intentionally set up to fail from the content in the shows? May be thinking too deep into this but it seems like kids shows are unnecessarily bizarre and silly and sometimes I wonder if it is intentional by the creepy producers in order to set these kids up to fail so that when they are finished with these shows they have a hard time being taken seriously in future roles and have to either oversexualize themselves to break out of their image or fall into drugs and get preyed on by other creeps in Hollywood. Even in the last 20 years the evolution of the humor and the set design has become so crazy like I know this isn’t the best example considering what happened but Drake and Josh had a relatively normal looking house even though they still had a huge super cool room the colors were normal and the living room was realistic, kids shows now have these super colorful houses with the most random stuff inside and I’m sure there are studies that show kids are more engaged to shows with bright colors and wacky situations but honestly as someone who grew up when this newer shows were playing and older shows were being rerun there was no difference in fact I enjoyed the more realistic shows more. Even family sitcoms were more enjoyable than kid shows when I was  like king of queens, everybody loves Raymond, Malcolm in the middle, fresh prince. They may have had a few more adult jokes every once in a while but most of it was kid friendly and not so silly that the actors were left feeling humiliated like Jeannette talks about with iCarly. I still enjoyed shows like iCarly but I think some of the silliness was unnecessary for the humor to still be good. I feel bad that these kids think they have hit the jackpot when they get cast for a kids tv channel because they will be famous but when their time runs out and they have to move on to adult roles their resume seems worthless because they have only been silly characters even if they have the talent to do other things. Does anyone else feel this way?   Not to mention how many of the silly things they have to do have creepy undertones but this is already a long rant so that is for another day.",belgeselsever,1fkk7og

"Soledad O’Brien episode 5 I really appreciate that this documentary kickstarted a conversation I and many others have been part of for years, a conversation that is much bigger than Nickelodeon, and I feel for all the victims who spoke out and the ones who didn’t or can’t anymore.   But I want to point out, as a journalist, I appreciate Soledad O’Brien. Approaching an interview like this takes a lot of finesse and thoughtfulness. I think she respectfully, professionally and ethically asked the hard questions we’re all thinking while also asking questions that humanize Drake Bell and allow him to tell his story on his terms. I like how she’s able to be frank but also sensitive about this subject. It’s just refreshing to watch a reporter like this, it’s actually so important and needed to even get stories like this out there to begin with.   My heart really goes out to all the victims seen and unseen and I’m glad there is a team out there from this doc and many other reporters who haven’t lost sight of the REAL TRUTH and their commitment to reporting FOR THE PEOPLE. It takes the courage and sacrifice of the victims to tell their stories and efforts of the press to provide them a media outlet. And both are constantly challenged not to do so.   The conversation is not over!!   EDIT: P.S. just wanted to add that Schneider’s interview that was featured in ep5 (I watched in full length). is BS!!

I’m not saying PizzaGate is real and I’m not suggesting wild things like Queen Elizabeth being the head of a child exploitation ring farming children for adrenochrome, but it does seem that Hollywood or the entertainment industry at large has a somewhat cult like obsession with the violation of children. Even just the sick allusions to sex and innuendos that are exposed in this documentary… for me I lost the plot when the boy was being licked by dogs.  Who is it for? Is there some elite or Kabal that desires the corruption of children and the subliminal corruption of their audiences?  Growing up I had a real aversion to the Nickelodeon shows because they always felt off to me and some of the content was just gross and downright stupid… I loved the Amanda Show however but the rest felt inane and weird to me. Now I know why it never sat well with me. I have always been a very “aware” person and as a kid I had a 6th sense for “creepy” behaviour.

"Benji Gregory It's rare to find a kid that was involved with the media in the 80s that didn't have drug and mental health concerns.   Benji's death also reminds me how Adam Rich died not long ago. I met Adam Rich when he was in his role on 7 is Enough. We were kids and I felt totally  betrayed when I found out his name wasn't really Nicolas. Kids were routinely deceived on sets to get them to ""act"" accordingly.   Hollywood has been called a cult many times. High control groups, cults, and organized crime all blend.  Benji had a Twitter account below the radar linked to his Instagram where he wrote that he hopes Trump commits suicide like Epstein.He had a license plate that says depresion, ordered custom sneakers that say bipolar, and his x account handle is needle_xchange.   I am surprised at the request  people to donate to Actors Equity Union in lieu of flowers. He hasn't acted since the 90s. I seriously suspect that he experienced abuse with the media people. The actors that played the parents on ALF always seemed pretty nice. Still, we know too well how much predators lurked.     I'm sorry that it has to be after someone dies. Like that line from the Big Chill, ""They throw you a big party on the one day you can't come."" In spirit though, we remain.   I hope that there can be more support groups for survivors of hollywood. Competitiveness in media and drowning out inconvenient discussions can lead to isolation. The public has beliefs about a set and you know things they don't. There should be more spaces for actors to come together and talk. That should also include kids that were hidden behind the scenes. Adult survivors need that support as well. We can say things as adults that maybe we couldn't say then.

"Who's Responsible? (My Thoughts) I've honestly gone from finishing the show to watching YouTube posts about this problem again to make up my mind overall. Obviously, we mostly know who's to blame, but some of the people who were interviewed on the show (I feel), should also be blamed.   Let's start off with the parents. ""They're gonna think I'm a bad parent,"" mom; Need I say more? Also, I take it that none of the kids understood the adult humor they were presenting to people watching those shows, but their parents were watching those kids, right? So, I'm sure that they understood it. They probably thought that this was funny and was too focused on their kids being famous, to think anything of it.  Next, the writers. They made me so angry. If I remember correctly, one got fired, and one quit. But the thing is, when you knew these dirty jokes that these kids were presenting to other kids and you wrote it inside the script, you should've quit then and there. Both of them! The woman only left nickelodeon when Dan Schnieder was treating her badly.  Overall, I've watched this show months ago, so I don't entirely remember the whole thing. I would love to hear if you disagree or if you feel like more people who weren't named responsible were. Or, if you have anything extra you want to say, I'm all for it.tothink",belgeselsever,1dbfv0d

"Drake Bell, Justin Beiber beef So in light of quiet on set and the recent lawsuits against Diddy I thought it was worth discussing an angle I previously hadn't seen.  Obviously, Beiber has not spoke out against Diddy. I'm not even suggesting anything predatory necessarily happened to him. Only that there might have been rumours flying around Hollywood and that Drake might have believed them.  Is it possible Drake saw Beibers success and believed the rumours about what went down at Diddys house and felt some kind of way about it?  Like Drake exposed his abuser and felt like he'd been blacklisted.  He may have seen Beibers success and believed something had happened to him and he that was being rewarded for his silence. Like Beiber was playing the Hollywood game in a way that he wasnt able to.   I can see how that could have been a catalyst for the beef to start. Especially, as it was pretty one sided.

We as an audience are not owed a story that will hurt someone who is already a victim.   I especially see this happening to Amanda Bynes. Apparently she was approached and had a breakdown at just the thought. Someone like her, who has tried to speak out before and was treated worse for it, may never be in a place where she can talk about it again. It's her right to protect her peace, however much of it she can have at this point.

"Drake Bell was charged for inappropriate texts, not sexual or physical abuse or photos A lot of people have posted allegations about Drake Bell as fact in reference to the 2021 criminal charges against him. But assertions aren't automatically reality and accusations aren't immediately fact. Bell was never charged with sexual assault. He was charged for inappropriate texts to a teenaged girl. The investigation revealed that he didn't and couldn't have assaulted this specific person. He did do something **very wrong** with his texts to her, and he pleaded guilty to that and *only* that.    Bell told his story in the recent *La Verdad* podcast at [  At 1:20:36, Bell says:  >*About two years ago, I'd been talking with somebody on Instagram that later turned out to be underage. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. There were charges brought against me because this person had claimed that I had done all of these horrible things physically, and was sending inappropriate pictures and all these types of things. I was investigated for 18 months.*   >   >*They took my phone and my computers and subpoenaed all of my social media and everything. To which they found that none of that occurred. But because I had been talking in a way that I shouldn't have been before the age had come to light, they were able to bring charges against me.*   >   >*And then, they -- \[the accuser\] made a statement in court and said that I'd done all of these things. And the media picked that up and ran with it. And said this is what I plead guilty to and this is what I did. And the entire world thought that I was some monster.*   >   >*Which was really hard for me because I was being called -- by the entire internet and media -- what Brian is.*   >   >*The New York Times reported that I was a registered sexual offender and that I had plead guilty to sexual assault. None of which was true.*   >   >*I plead guilty to these conversations, nothing physical, and it was even brought up in the trial that this is not what this case is about. It's not a sexual assault case. He's not pleading guilty to anything physical or anything sexual. But the media only took the first half of my trial and put that all over the news because that more salacious and that was going to get more attention.*   >   >*I had engaged in certain conversations and that was what they charged me with. I ended up doing 200 hours of community service and two years of probation.*  The sentencing video for Bell's case is here: [  In the case and as summarized in the video: Bell's accuser said that he sexually assaulted her twice at two performances at fan meet and greet events, and sent her nude photos and threats. Many have taken the accuser's allegations as fact. I have done so as well and I regret it.  In the video, Bell's lawyer refutes the allegations in a highly factual manner. Bell's lawyer points out: the girl filed a police report with her allegations. Police subpoenaed Bell's social media account access, personal computers and phones and devices, as well as his accuser's, and also questioned the accusers' friends and family.  They determined that Bell had been corresponding with the girl in text and their interactions included lewd and sexual messages. Bell had not known her age or that she had been the same fan he'd met at several meet and greets (although her writing style and photo should have indicated she was young and likely a minor). Bell sent the girl no photos and never attempted to meet the girl in person.  When the girl told Bell her age over text, he texted back a flirty message, ""Hurry up,"" expressing a desire for her to turn 18. After this message, he blocked her (which I'd say was the only sensible thing he did).  While Bell did indeed meet the girl at fan meet and greets, the girl's family and friends said in interviews with police that Bell and the girl were never alone together, and there was no opportunity for Bell to have carried out any of the physical assaults described by the girl in her accusations or victim impact statement.  Note that in the video, Bell's attorney summarizes the investigation and its conclusions in this way. **At no point does the prosecution object** to his descriptions nor does the judge find the attorney in contempt for misrepresenting the investigation's findings. We can take the summary as accurate since the prosecutor doesn't object to it.  My opinion:  **Bell committed a serious wrong in texting what he did to this girl,** even if he didn't commit the other crimes. He did not know her age, but as a former teen heartthrob and a musician with young fans, he *should* have known that his fan mail could come from underage parties.   I am disappointed by how too many Drake Bell fans whitewash his texts or deny that they were inappropriate. They were a solid foundation for the charges of child endangerment and disseminating material harmful to a minor. By Bell's own admission: ""I had been talking in a way that I shouldn't have been before the age had come to light, they were able to bring charges against me.""  What he texted was wrong. But it was not sexual assault and it was not physical assault, and while he blocked her far too late, he did block her. That indicates that there is some sense of right and wrong there.  Bell was flirtatious and made an immature little girl think a celebrity would be her boyfriend (deliberately or accidentally), and it seems to me that when she found out he was engaged to be married, she used his messages to inflate his actions into assault in an attempt at revenge. That was wrong too.   **But Bell was an adult, and Bell should never have been texting that girl.** Bell's case is a textbook example of why celebrities need social media representatives to handle their accounts for them, respond to non-consequential ones, and work with their client to review to serious messages.  Given the photo and how the average 12 year old would write, I think Bell should have known he was in contact with a juvenile. I think he must have kept himself willfully ignorant of her actual age by never asking for it until it came out.  **Why did he do this?** Why was he texting and flirting with this girl? Especially when he never intended to meet her?  **It's certain that Bell surviving sexual assault seriously screwed up his view of relationships and boundaries.** Survivors sometimes become self-destructive because of their emotional wounds. Bell may have sought validation in this girl's immature adoration.  He may have sought control in his interactions with this girl with a flirtation confined to his phone as a way to reclaim some of the power that Bell's rapist stole from him. Also, trauma survivors struggle with impulse control and decisionmaking. Emotional responses can override rational thoughts.   **Bell's actions were disordered and confused:** he didn't try to meet the girl in person and eventually blocked her, yet he responded to her messages and sent one even after learning her age, and just before he blocked her. This speaks to a present but severely damaged moral compass.   Bell's sense of right wrong may not be broken, but it has been unfortunately warped by the abuse he endured, the humiliation he experienced, the ongoing impact of his trauma, and his alcoholism and drug addiction.  There are other accusations against Bell from an ex-girlfriend, Melissa Lingafelt, regarding domestic abuse. I don't know if those are true or not, but **in this specific criminal case,** the accusations of physical and sexual assault are clearly not true. However, the accusations of grossly inappropriate texting are true, and Drake Bell pleaded guilty to the texting and has paid for his crimes.  That doesn't mean anyone has to support him, but no one should misrepresent this criminal case of inappropriate texting as a criminal case of sexual assault.",belgeselsever,1bsbebz

"Kimmy Robertson is a sick individual Drake said that the worst letter out of the 41 written to the Judge in defense of Brian Peck, was Kimmy Robertson’s.

An outrageous, overtly gay, oversexed person with no idea what he was doing to Brian, Brian’s family, and Brian’s friends.”  Kimmy is calling Drake, a 14-15 year old at this time, an, “oversexed person.” That is a child being accused of tempting a grown man and being described as an extremely sexual kid.

"The media is ignoring Brian Peck I've noticed a little something.

It would take TMZ like 2 seconds to find him and swarm him like they do with every single celebrity or person involved in tabloid controversy, but NOPE. There's nothing. They're purposely just letting him wander free without any accountability or anyone even confronting him about his crimes. I'm not saying I approve of the sort of stuff TMZ does, I'm just saying if they're gonna do that, why not do it to someone who deserves it?? If they can track down JK Rowling's abuser in a completely different country, I'm sure they can confront Brian Peck.

"I strive to be as good a parent as Drake’s girlfriend’s Mom. Out of the whole wretched documentary she was a bright spot. She really looked out for him, let him know the situation was abnormal, she called his Mom about it, and she took Drake to her family’s therapist.  Had she not done that the abuse may have gone on longer. She saw something, said something, and did something based on her accurate suspicions. Kudos to her, she is a fantastic Mom and an everyday hero. Not just to her own kids but her kids partner, too.",belgeselsever,1bp9r7d
"My opinion on Drake Bell took a 180 after seeing this. I felt really conflicted about him because of the whole “disseminating harmful material to a juvenile” charge and subsequent guilty plea. When my mom told me to watch this documentary and what happened to him, it shifted my view of him. Two things can be true at the same time-he can be a survivor of abuse who went on to perpetuate the cycle. I’m glad he’s got his life together, is sober, and seems to have a lot of self-reflection and knows that what he did was wrong. I don’t know, I still feel a little conflicted, but I’m glad he’s getting space to be allowed to open up about his abuse. There are no perfect victims. Idk, is it just me with this opinion?",belgeselsever,1c03nvc
"Updated/additional information on Brian Peck since Quiet on Set So, I’ve been watching Drake Bell’s recent interviews and I follow Obiscure Nick on twitter (check out their page! They’ve been following this all for years:  and I decided to make a list of updated/additional information that’s been given to us about Brian Peck and also Drake Bell because I feel like a lot of people don’t know about these updates.  1.) Drake Bell has changed his mind about people in the industry (ADULTS btw. Drake Bell was not referring to the child actors he worked with. He was referring to producers, directors, etc.) not knowing about his abuse despite him not telling anyone (Sarah Fraser, Yordi, Roberto, Drake Bell’s twitter) - he specifically changed his mind about this after finding out about and reading the letters. When he did his interview for Quiet on Set, it was prior to the letters. He now believed that many Hollywood elites knew and that he didn’t realize he was surrounded by people who knew he was the John Doe and still supported Brian Peck.   2.) Brian Peck did not serve his full sentence (Yordi)  3.) Drake Bell saw Brian Peck AFTER Peck’s release at a restaurant. Brian Peck was sitting at a table SURROUNDED by teenage boys (Yordi)  4.) Dan potentially lied about not having anything to do with Brian Peck being hired at Nickelodeon. Dan apparently hired Brian Peck for a show he created called “Guys Like Us” in 1998. On this show, Brian Peck played “Happy Pants the Clown” (Alexa Nikolas and Eat Predators uncovered this and are going to go over it on stream)  5.) Drake Bell said that Brian Peck would give him alcohol months prior to assaulting him. So, Brian Peck would throw parties at his house with his ADULT FRIENDS, give a 14 year old Drake Bell alcohol, and then have him sleep over (Yordi)  6.) Drake Bell confirmed that alcohol was used during the assaults and heavily implied that drugs were used multiple times and that the assaults got way worse after drugs were used (Yordi)  7.) Drake Bell and friends of Drake Bell have said that major media outlets in USA do not (or cannot?) interview Drake Bell. This is why he’s only going on famous Mexican podcasts or smaller American podcasts. For some reason, he's off limits for interviewing despite Quiet on Set being a trending topic. The media outlets making articles are basing their information on other podcasts interviewing Drake Bell but will not interview him themselves (Sarah Fraser) This in addition to the New York Times retracting their statement from 2021 lying about Drake Bell being a registered sex offender paints an interesting picture about the media.  8.) Drake Bell and the journalists behind Quiet on Set said that it was a struggle to find any news coverage online about the Brian Peck case OR the other Nickelodeon pedophile cases—especially articles from the early 2000s. Articles only started popping up after An Open Secret. So, these cases were buried intentionally (Sarah Fraser)  9.) Drake Bell reconfirmed that he struggles with memory loss (Yordi, Roberto) and that he blacked out a lot of things from his teenage years. Apparently, he reconnected with his ex girlfriend from the early 2000s and when she brings up events, he can't remember them. He also said he blacked out faces from the court room from his head and it wasn't until the letters that a lot of the memories came back to him. That probably explains his change in opinion after the letters.  10.) Drake Bell told his girlfriend at the time about the abuse before he told anyone else (Yordi) and she was most likely why he reported Brian Peck. Apparently she would go on dinners and stuff with Drake Bell and Brian Peck (these are the memories Drake seemed to have blacked out). Brian Peck didn't like her and tried to convince Drake Bell's mother to stop Drake from seeing her  11.) The investigators at the time believed that Brian Peck had multiple victims (someone found the original report)  That's all I can think of. So, if people are confused about conflicting information, just remember that the interview for Quiet On Set occurred almost a year ago. Drake Bell seems to have had pretty bad dissociative related memory black outs due to trauma and is unraveling the memories in real time.   Feel free to add additional information if I missed any.",belgeselsever,1bq0owy

"John Wayne Gacy I need to know who else’s jaw dropped to the fucking floor when it got to the clown painting/John Wayne Gacy pen pal letters?  AND THE FACT THAT NO ADULTS THOUGHT THAT WAS WEIRD? It just turned into show and tell.  The moment the guy was explaining the clown painting my husband (criminologist) immediately said “I bet you it’s a Gacy original and he admired JWG.”  Edit to add:  Gacy was arrested in 78 (Peck was 18) and was executed in 94 (Peck was 34), after 16 years in prison.  Imagine the kind of relationship Gacy and Peck had via pen pals because Gacy didn’t start painting until he was in prison. It also most likely means that Peck reached out to Gacy and initiated the relationship.",belgeselsever,1bmdhyx

"The bathrooms After watching the Luminosity podcast, one thing I can’t stop thinking about is Drake’s associations with bathrooms. He says that he often views bathrooms as a safe space and for the longest, but he never knew why, he just went with it. He would find himself sitting on the floor of his bathroom doing work, lying in there with pillows and blankets, just always finding comfort in a bathroom. It wasn’t until recently that he made the realization as to why. Drake explained that he loves bathrooms so much because that was the only safe place at Brian’s house. The bathroom was the only place he could excuse himself for a shower or using the restroom, and the only place where he could lock himself in. He would hide from Brian by staying locked in the bathroom.   His girlfriend at the time reminded him of a story when Drake was supposed to hangout with his girlfriend but Peck refused to take him there. The girlfriend and her mother got in the car and drove all the way to Brian’s house demanding for Drake. They had found him hiding out in a bathroom at that time.   It really breaks my heart to hear what he was going through at only fifteen years old. I don’t know why that one stuck with me so much. He just wanted to get out so badly but didn’t know how to. He was so afraid.   Edit: I realized I never shared the podcast he talked about this stuff. It’s in [this podcast]( but please listen with caution, it can be very triggering.",belgeselsever,1c3n2mb
"Haven’t been the same I don’t know about you guys but I haven’t been the same ever since the last episode.  I mean I've watched documentaries before about child abuse/exposing pedos ext but this felt so much more personal particularly because I'm a 90s kid and I had a really difficult childhood so I found escapism through watching my favourite shows on Nickelodeon/Disney, particularly The Amanda Show. For at least 30mins I knew I was guaranteed to be happy and to know that the kids who were bringing me joy during my tough times were going through so much abuse is really devastating",belgeselsever,1bmwvkd
"I think this new episode was a disservice to the actual documentary I hate to say this but this new last episode seems very stretched. Everything is adding on the original show of course, but I have to say that the anger over “only” two African Americans was drama over nothing with substance. If we are going to run with that then why not be upset over not having native Americans, each gender of Asians, Indians, etc.  I think these people in this episode wanted their extra 15 minutes of fame and it’s unfortunate.   I loved this documentary and it was SO informative of the abuse in child acting and of course the horrible trauma Drake Bell experienced. Those episode just wasn’t “it”.",belgeselsever,1byl0fd

Possibly an unpopular opinion but I just need to say it. Finished watching Quiet on the Set last night and I am actually infuriated by the lack of focus on the real subject matter. I'm not saying Dan didn't do anything wrong because he did but there was 3 episodes focused around him and only one on the true victim that truly suffered on the set. I feel they should have focused more on why Brian only got 16 months and was able to work at Disney after. Also they should have dropped all 41 names of the people who wrote letters to support him. I feel they went the total wrong direction with this documentary and the main focus was lost. May be an unpopular opinion but Dan should not have as much hate as he does when he didn't do anything close to what the other 3 men have done.,belgeselsever,1bk714i
"What the hell is wrong with the adults in this? Specifically Brandi’s mom in E2 A grown man sends a video of himself jerking off to your 11 year old daughter and you don’t call the police because you’re embarrassed you let her email him?   What kind of logic is this.   My father is a pedophile. I wasn’t the one abused but my story growing up was fucking horrific so to see that there are adults like Brandi’s mother that exist, as well as the writers on the show that were afraid of losing their jobs and did nothing absolutely disgust me.   I no longer speak to my mother but I will always respect her for calling the police on my father and never turning back even after 23 years of marriage... Not the make any of this about me but just came here to say shame on every adult in this documentary that allowed these things to happen to not only their own child, but others to come.",belgeselsever,1bnydd2
"Grooming kid viewers The more I look into all of this, it seems less and less about pushing boundaries or hiding sexual innuendos for the heck of it, and more and more of calculated content creation for pedophiles while simultaneously grooming child actor and the viewers - a lot of this content blurred the lines of what is and isn’t appropriate conversations and behavior, especially between children and adults, the fact that they had a child rapist actively featured in scenes and blatantly talking about and playing with phallic objects is beyond disturbing and evidence that they at minimum didn’t care about the influence this content would have, and at worst, used it as a way to maximize their predator reach into the psyche of kids…  I feel betrayed and used… there is a real level of influence and manipulation going on for all viewers, many of whom were just at puberty age and highly impressionable at the time, and unable to distinguish what was ok or not - they broke a real trust that this was all fun and games, a trust that they established - this content blatantly attempts to normalize child porn and groom all children involved, on both sides of the scene - and every adult let it happen. Nickelodeon knew it, supported it, profited out of it. I wouldn’t be surprised if they recognized the potential for money and directly invested/produce underground child porn.",belgeselsever,1boejqc
16 MONTHS ????? i’m just FLABBERGASTED and disturbed that Drake went into detail about the abuse and his abuser got 16 months? because he got some dumb letters?  Then the letters saying “brian was tempted” so fucking infuriating. reminds me of people saying “she asked for it” or “what was she wearing” when discussing womens SA.   I find it hard to believe these people writing letters had “no idea” what was going on like they tried to showcase when they have come out and given statements defending their letter now that’s it’s come to light. idk i’m just fucking mad and heartbroken for them all.,belgeselsever,1bq2xfs

"A few things that stood out to me the most about this documentary: 1. How many of sexual innuendos flew over my head as a kid, 2. How Nickelodeon was the perfect breeding ground for all this to go down, and 3. How no one thought twice about Brian Peck being pen pals with a serial killer. Being born in the early 90’s I grew up watching All That, The Amanda Show, Keenan and Kel, I mean quite literally I watched all of the programming. I was a bit dumbfounded watching the clips back that were so blatant in their sexual innuendo’s. All of those jokes completely evaded me and flew over my head…I never picked up on it. Anybody in this subreddit actually pick up in these jokes as a kid? Or was I just completely sheltered?? As an adult they’re just obvious. I never watched iCarly or Victorious because I was transitioning into high school at that point and had moved on to MTV. But those clips with Ariana Grande had my jaw drop.    Nickelodeon truly was the perfect breeding ground for sexual harassment, sexual assault, discrimination etc. Not only can instances such as these be written off as “a joke” but having a ‘super-wacky-goofy’ work environment, where it’s not always encouraged to be professional, paired with a code of silence (that permeates the entire industry in general), it’s no wonder this all went down. Children will emulate what they see in front of them. Not only that, they may not speak up when they feel uncomfortable or supported. How Nickelodeon had such oversight seems almost negligible.    Lastly no one batted an eyelash at the fact that Brian Peck, a guy who was working with kids everyday, was corresponding with a serial killer?? I am absolutely astonished by that. There is something ethically and morally wrong with that.",belgeselsever,1bnmzma

"Brian Peck Had More Than One Victim IMO I have a very hard time believing that Drake Bell was the only child that Brian Peck sexually assaulted.    Does anyone know of any other child SA allegations against him?    Honestly hearing what Drakes father said about Pecks mannerisms around other child actors leads me to believe it’s a possibility.  Bottom line, I highly doubt what happened to Drake Bell at the hands of Brian Peck was an isolated incident.  Edited:   Speculation naming of potential victim removed.",belgeselsever,1bvy9to

"Tik Tok’s issue with romanticization Ok so I’ve been on TikTok for a while and something I’ve come across is when something gets popular on there of course there will be the conspiracies, and the people who disagree but something I have noticed as of recently is people making sad edits of  Amanda Bynes Drake Bell The iCarly cast The Henry danger cast Etc  Which wouldn’t be weird but they are making them in the context of what it’s been filled through the documentary and people will be leaving comments like “do you think they told each other about their assault” like no.

"Schneider People are too fixated imo on whether Dan Schneider actually assaulted any of his child stars to the point where they’re haranguing them about it. I think it goes to show that there’s a certain cultural relish for pedo hunting that has very little to do with wanting victims to recover and live happy lives.  There’s almost this disappointment about the stuff that’s revealed when it’s not “bad enough”. He made children uncomfortable with inappropriate jokes and put them into inappropriate situations and fucked with their mental and physical health. He failed to safeguard them against actual predators. I don’t need to know any more about him or his private motivations to know that’s fucked up. He sexually harassed adult women too, which is also awful.  I know people want some kind of legal accountability but it’s got to feel bad for people who were brave enough to speak up about what they went through if it’s all being kind of tossed aside because it’s not the evidence of outright molestation they expected. (Or it is but it’s not from the guy the public takes a certain amount of pride in having “caught.”)  I know people have good intentions for the most part, idk.

Amanda Bynes, Ariana Grande, and every other actor don’t owe you anything! They don’t have to share their story or make a public statement. Everyone jumped down Josh Peck’s throat because he didn’t publicly acknowledge Drake just for him and Drake to explain that Josh had just reached out privately like a normal person.   All the speculating and harrassing people accusing them of having NDAs and straight up demanding they tell you about their trauma for your own self gratification and nosiness is so nasty and weird.   If you want to be helpful and supportive, lift up the voices of those who were already brave enough to come forward and others as they choose to share their stories at THEIR OWN PACE. But until then just leave them alone. These are real people and specifically real people that you DON’T EVEN KNOW!

"It really bothers me how much body shaming Amanda Bynes gets Since watching the doc I've been going on a deep dive on Amanda since she's been quiet about the allegations and in general won't really talk about her time on TV (which is her absolutely her choice and she shouldn't be pushed to ""tell all"" if she doesn't want to and especially before she's ready - people need to respect her privacy and boundaries).   But based on all the people constantly bringing up her body/appearance on social media, I think it’s no wonder she wants to stay out of the spotlight. She already had a ton of body image issues as a young girl which is such a shame because she was (and still is) so pretty.   Amanda Bynes has been through a lot. She’s had a mental breakdown and struggled a lot with mental health issues and drug abuse. Almost every youtube video about her ‘downfall’ is flooded with comments like “she used to be so cute” “she was my crush but now ew” “she used to be a 10 now she’s a 3” .   I almost wish youtubers would just stop making videos about her for this reason. Even with good intentions I don’t think people realize harping on her appearance so much does more harm than good and I wish they would think about how she feels and how constantly showing ""before"" and ""after"" pictures of her at her lows might contribute to her continued mental health struggles.   Also, it shouldn't need to be said that people are allowed to change their looks/style. Constantly mentioning her weight/eyebrows is bad enough but ragging on her just because she likes to wear wigs/change her hairstyle? Ridiculous. A lot of women like wearing wigs, for a variety of reasons. Most people in their late 30s also aren’t going to look like they did when they were in their teens and 20s. Bodies change, the effects of the types of prescription medications she's taking are guaranteed to affect appearance.",belgeselsever,1bwkh4p

"People v. Brian Peck This is something I wanted to point out. As a paralegal, I was immediately impressed when the producers stated they are the ones who requested the court to unseal the letters of support written for Brian Peck. Unsealing court documents isn’t a 1 step process (especially in light of a very sensitive court case such as CSA). You have to establish legitimate reason for the records to be unsealed.  The other thing that caught my attention was during Drakes interview, the interviewer asks if anyone from Nickelodeon, like executives, reached out to him or talked to him after Brian’s arrest. This was a clear fish to try to get drake to say “no one one reached out” but instead his response was Dan Schneider was the only one.   2 things regarding his response: 1: I don’t believe Nickelodeon KNEW he was the victim. They would not of known who to reach out to. He was minor and every document will be sealed if it contained his legal name and his name will only be referred to as John Doe in every public record. It was very clear that Drake NEVER went public with the story until now. He said multiple times he was left wondering if they knew it would be him and he held everything inside. He even said he’s not sure many people knew. This is also clear at the end of episode  2 when the Amanda Show director even asks the interviewer: “it wasn’t a child on our set was it?” And she says yes leading to Drake’s reveal.   Not that Nickelodeon is innocent in any way…but there is no way they would have known it was Drake unless his story went public. They only would know their employee, Brian Peck, is being charged. Not the victims name.   2: HOW did Dan Schneider know it was Drake then? My suspicion is either Brian maybe told him shit was going down to see if he could get support or Drake told him directly due to their relationship. If so, that really shows the power dynamic Dan had over these children that they trusted Dan so much that he even knew before representatives of Nickelodeon if he was the only one who reached out to Drake.",belgeselsever,1bkcv2l
"Things they left out of the documentary… 1. Icarly. There were no members of icarly willing to speak up about Dan or any on set behavior which is interesting. I remember hearing a story years ago about how T-bo was made a main character because there were no black actors in the show, and he wasn’t originally in the Michelle Obama episode until he complained and they wrote him in.  2. Gibby - there was a failed pilot for Gibby, and also he was shirtless all the time, makes me wonder if that actor was comfortable doing so.  3. Victorious - online videos (famous creepy ones of Ariana) were not approved by the network because they didn’t have to be. Makes you wonder who wrote those videos…  4.

However, in the last 24 hours I’ve noticed a trend to connect this to the whole Q, Pizzagate,”Sound of Freedom” everyone-I-don’t -like-is-a-pedo crowd, and it’s a touch disturbing.   What happened at Nick, and what has been documented with other actors/tresses since Hollywood began in the 30s is awful. There IS a rot in the entertainment industry that does need to be addressed. However, the aforementioned crowd that is latching onto this  don’t actually care about exploited and SA’d children, they just want to use this as an excuse to adjunct their version of what is happening and use it to end *all* entertainment they don’t like,control what is left, and that is rather frightening.  If they actually cared, they would laser focus on churches, not *just* Hollywood, who they believe is responsible for the end of a Christian controlled nation and most social ailments of today.  Downvote me to hell, but childhood SA is a culture wide problem that is *heavily* represented in church settings.

"This article from NY times about Drake Bell with details from court documents [  This old article includes a few interesting things.  *But a transcript of Mr. Peck’s sentencing hearing in 2004 quotes the  victim, who is not identified, as saying, “I have to live with this for  the rest of my life. And let me tell you, it’s horrific.”*   *Mr. Peck said he felt “deep and profound remorse” for his actions and  took responsibility for them. He said he found the victim to be an  “extremely talented” working professional who he considered “equal to me  and my friends.”*   *At  the hearing, Mr. Bell, then 18, described not wanting to be alone at  night. “The things that he did to me,” Mr. Bell said of Mr. Peck, “I  don’t think anyone in here could have ever possibly imagined.”*  *“Whatever  he gets,” Mr. Bell added, “he doesn’t have to live with the knowledge  of a 41-year-old man all over him for the rest of his life.”*  I find interesting that Peck considered Drake is equal when he was 15 and Peck 41.

"Dan is a red herring Am I defending Dan? No. I think he’s a weird misogynistic person who hates women and loves to embarrass them. Do I think he’s a child predator? Based on the documentary, not really. There’s a literal John Wayne Gacy admirer free on the streets of LA, Jason Handy is locked up AGAIN for the same crimes (not to be released until 2038) and no one is talking about it, but instead we’re riled up about a man with a foot fetish.  Unpopular opinion probably: I don’t think Dan is any different from the creeps in Hollywood that work on adult programming. After hearing that he wasn’t creepy to only children but just all women in general was, as bad as it sounds, a relief. He gives off “underdog incel finally won and now he’s going power crazy,” not “pedo who managed to make his way up the ranks.”   I feel like there were so many bigger fish to fry but the series came off as just a Dan Schneider hit piece. Drake Bell’s story was just a glimpse of what Nickelodeon (and the entire industry) is hiding but instead they decided to document the least problematic of the offenders. I especially didn’t like how they used Jennette’s memoir about her mother and the mental struggles she endured to bring up Dan. That book had very little to do with him and A LOT to do with the horrors of child fame, which is what I thought this was going to be about.   Children’s entertainment is HUGE and I think Dan is a red herring. It’s a festering ground for pedos but no one in the industry besides the victims talk about it. It’s easy to point fingers at a man whose crude humor belongs in adult programming and whose behavior matches textbook workplace harassment. He ended up in children’s entertainment instead, and no one told him that an environment full of kids and teens shouldn’t be exposed to his antics cause they were too scared to lose their jobs, and the executives were blinded by the cash cows he kept creating to hold him accountable. When he stopped making them as much money as he used to with shows like iCarly and Drake & Josh, that’s when they bothered to care. 2017 is around the time children’s TV started to lose to YouTube, and remember there was a lawsuit filed way back during the Amanda Show, yet nothing changed. They knew settling would be more cost effective.   Edit: I’m hearing a lot of “he raped Amanda Bynes”…when was that mentioned?",belgeselsever,1bn1yxj
"Drake Bell is a Prime Example of the Long-Term Effects of Child Sex Abuse Tbh, after seeing online sources (including his 2021 hearing) and the documentary (also, some comments on other posts gave me some things to think about and try and find another side to the story. Admittedly I was probably a bit biased), I think there’s a big gray area here. I support Drake in his journey in bettering himself and healing. It sounds like telling his story publicly was a big step in his healing process. He was battling a lot of demons, but while it’s fine to be compassionate when it comes to his trauma, we cannot forget how harmful is behavior was when he was under the influence and how badly he fucked up the past 2 decades.   Now, SG (the girl he was sending inappropriate text messages to), I’m very skeptical of her story because there are some holes in it (edit: the inappropriate photo allegation was definitely a lie). That’s not to say he should’ve been let off the hook because he was in fact sending a minor inappropriate text messages. He was guilty of that, but that’s all. He also plead guilty because he wanted to get it over with.   On the other hand, many of his exes, such as Melissa Lingafelt, have come out and said he was incredibly abusive. That’s where the he-said-she-said is much more evident. I know Drake has been kind to fans over the years, but it’s important to remember that we don’t know what Drake is/was truly like when there were no cameras around, especially when alcohol came into play. Drake himself admitted that he has hurt people when he was drunk.  When we think about his actions these past 2 decades and what we saw in the documentary, the abuse was definitely the foundation for a very troubled and very harmful adult life. Drake should’ve gotten stronger mental help a VERY long time ago. Would I say Drake is an angel? No. But I don’t think he’s inherently a demon. His head was fucked six ways to Sunday. At the very least, he was an awful boyfriend and he had no business driving, let alone dating with where his mental health was at. He had so much shit to work through. I don’t think it’s wrong to support Drake Bell where his trauma is concerned. I still do. But it is wrong that people have automatically assumed all his accusers are lying just because we learned that he himself was a victim. And whether or not they are in fact lying, it’s clear that his nice, friendly demeanor was hiding a very troubled, traumatized, damaged young man who made bad decisions and engaged in self-sabotaging behavior.   That being said, I’m truly happy that he really is trying to better himself (after all. He’s got a son) and has owned up to the fact that he made a lot of bad decisions and hurt people, including himself. It doesn’t make what he did ok by any means, but it’s great that he’s working on improving himself as a person. We can have compassion for Drake and commend him for trying to better himself, while holding him accountable for his actions at the same time.",belgeselsever,1c0wnld
"Does anyone else just think about who Drake could have been if none of this shit had happened and get really sad? I know this isn't necessarily, like, a productive discussion so much as it is just me having Feelings™ so like, mods feel free to remove this at your discretion, but like. I feel like Drake was genuinely so talented and its just *unfair* both what Brian did to him and how its affected the trajectory of basically his whole life afterwards - whether that be the way Nickelodeon responded to it (or didn't, as the case may be), his own \[alleged\] past abusive behaviour, his addiction, or just the amount of trauma that he still has to deal with. Its fucked up to have so much of your life destroyed by the shitty things a monster did to you as a child. He should have gotten therapy right away. It also should never have happened to begin with. He was failed by so many people, all of this was avoidable, and its such a fucking tragedy.",belgeselsever,1c45aqs
"“He tempted Brian” is such bullshit. I want to put this out there for everyone (even though it’s common fucking knowledge): It does NOT matter IF Drake had “tempted” BP. Because BP was the adult. Drake was a kid. And as an adult, BP had the responsibility of telling Drake no and saying it’s inappropriate. So regardless of what Drake “did” to “tempt” BP (according to the support letters), it was BP’s responsibility to shut it down because again, he was the ADULT. And for these support letters to say that BP was “tempted” by a child and thus is the reason he made the choice to horrifically abuse Drake is such bullshit. And it angers me that they said this about a CHILD.   I pray that Drake gets the help he needs to recover and heal from all this because it’s so horrible and traumatic.",belgeselsever,1c40ipt

Most of the shows had good premises but we always thought the jokes that we now know came from Dan were just too stupid and random. And the in your face way they were delivered made them worse.

"People who did the bare minimum to stop an abuser shouldn’t be praised as a hero Jerry Trainor, an adult actor who played Spencer on ICarly with Jennette McCurdy. Social media has framed him as some sort of savior when there’s literally no evidence of him protecting those kids from Dans abuse. He apparently would make jokes and try to distract him from bullying the child actors. If he witnessed these children being abused, what he did wasn’t good enough because those kids were still abused. I’m also not singling him out just pointing out TikTok’s hypocrisy. Do I think he’s a good guy, probably yeah. But to write fan fiction about someone because you need a hero in this devastating story is weird.   Also the video clips of him are interesting because people are really spinning the narrative.  In one video, Dan is calling the underage cast of ICarly “cute” and when he gets to Jerry, Jerry says “ew, don’t do it”. People think he’s saying ew don’t call these children cute when in actuality he’s telling Dan not to call himself, Jerry cute.  Another video is of the ICarly cast and Dan having a group hug and after they back away, Jerry turns his back to Dan to apparently block Dan from Hugging Miranda Cosgrove but in reality he’s just went to hold onto Miranda’s arm not intentionally “pushing” Dan aside.  None of the videos are truly showing that he intentionally put him in between Dan and the Kids. He might have been like an older brother figure to the cast because that’s what his character was, but he didn’t do anything to help those kids.",belgeselsever,1bsbza6

"Can we talk about trauma for a minute? Licensed therapist here! I’ve been lurking around on this sub for a bit, and I’ve noticed a lot of posts asking questions about trauma and PTSD, especially in regards to Drake Bell. I was hoping I could share some of my knowledge, as well as some resources, to help build some more understanding and awareness of how trauma affects people.   Spoiler alert: *I am not Drake Bell's therapist.* I’ve never met him or talked to him, either in a personal or professional capacity. I am sharing general knowledge about trauma and how it presents from an evidentiary perspective.  **What is PTSD?**  To offer a vast oversimplification, PTSD is a mental health condition that can occur when a person experiences a significant traumatic event(s) that overwhelms their abilities to process and cope. The body goes into a ""fight, flight, or freeze"" (FFF) response, and it never really turns that response off. (If there's any interest, I can also share how this process works. I love to geek about biopsychology.)  One thing to keep in mind is that everyone who experiences trauma and/or PTSD will respond differently. Even if a set of identical twins went through the exact same traumatic experience, they would still respond in very different ways.  Common PTSD symptoms include:   * Intrusive memories and/or flashbacks - I imagine everyone is familiar with this symptom, I think it's one of the first ones that comes to mind when people think of PTSD. In case you're not, people might have vivid memories of their trauma, to the point where it feels like they are experiencing the event all over again. This can happen as a result of a trauma trigger, or a reminder of their experience, or sometimes for no real reason at all. * Nightmares - this one is self-explanatory. Sometimes it will be a dream about the event, sometimes it will be a metaphor for the event, sometimes it's the event with some different details. * Avoidance - especially of triggers, but also of other things that might be perceived as stressful. Many people might also self-isolate, or prefer to only be around a few trusted people. Others might fear being alone, and will cling to relationships that aren't meaningful or healthy, because it feels safer than feeling alone. * Dysregulation - this is the term we use to describe the difficulty controlling strong emotions (emotional dysregulation), and that feeling of being stuck in FFF mode (physical dysregulation); people might react strongly to something that seems like it's not a big deal, or they might be too blasé about a situation that actually is dangerous. They might feel tense, have higher levels of fatigue, headaches, GI problems, and other physical symptoms. * Dissociation - if you're not familiar with dissociation already, it's kind of like ""zoning out"" and ""getting lost in thought."" Most people experience dissociation at a lower level (you've almost certainly had the experience of driving home, zoning out, and then asking yourself ""wait, how did I get here?""). There's a higher level where some people can go into this for hours or even days at a time; they might say or do things and have no memory of them later. * Depressive or anxious symptoms - depressed and/or anxious mood; insomnia or hypersomnia; difficulty focusing or concentrating; and rumination, which is a fancy word for getting stuck thinking about something too much; etc. * Co-occurring Substance Use Disorders - this isn't exactly a symptom, but many people who experience PTSD will struggle with substance abuse. Drugs and alcohol help people feel like they're dampening the FFF feelings. * Impaired social functioning - like I mentioned with avoidance, many folks will have trouble socializing ""normally"" after experiencing a trauma. Many of the symptoms listed above make it difficult to engage with others in a comfortable and natural way. And most other people around them either won't have had similar experiences, or they won't communicate about them openly (this tends to be culturally frowned upon), meaning that they feel alone, even with others around.  In addition to PTSD, there is another term that isn't technically in the DSM-V, though it should be (and hopefully will be whenever we move to the DSM-VI): Complex PTSD, or C-PTSD.  **What is C-PTSD?**  C-PTSD can occur when people experience chronic trauma, especially in childhood. It includes the more severe expressions of the symptoms I listed, plus additional difficulty with maintaining healthy relationships, identity formation, more extreme emotional reactions, feelings of shame and guilt, and low levels of self-worth. Folks with C-PTSD are very likely to struggle with trust, especially if their abuse was perpetrated by a parent, relative, or other trusted adult. They often lash out at loved ones and/or push them away.  People can become developmentally ""stuck"" at the emotional age they were at when the traumatic event happened. This is because different parts of the brain will develop differently, due to the influx of stress hormones released by the body. People might maintain some childlike behaviors or coping mechanisms, struggle to regulate emotions appropriately, and have difficulty making informed and independent decisions.  Their voice might also sound younger than they are (Gypsy Rose Blanchard is a great example of this).  ***Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)***  [*The ACEs study*]( *was a large study that was originally done in the 90s to help asses how important and impactful childhood trauma can be on a biopsychosocial level. I won't go super in-depth here (I linked an awesome TED Talk that does under the ""Resources"" tab, so if you're curious, please watch it!) but the TL;DR version is the more trauma a child experiences = the more likely they are to have disrupted neurological development = the more likely they are to experience behavioral problems and abuse substances = the more likely they are to experience health issues like cancer, heart disease, lung disease, immunological issues, etc.*  *The idea that trauma and mental health don't affect our physical health is totally false, and it's so important to be aware of these issues. The earlier the intervention, the better the outcome can be expected.*  **Survivors of Sexual Abuse**  There are some specific challenges that survivors of sexual abuse might face. They often need to feel more in control, especially in sexual situations. They often struggle with feeling ""dirty,"" ""lesser than,"" or that no one else will ""want them"" because of what they've been through. Physical boundaries can be very sensitive, and sexual intimacy can be triggering or difficult.  *On the opposite end, some folks will become hypersexual, and over-rely on their body and appearance. They might feel like that is ""all they're good for"" or what makes them valuable. They might have difficulty identifying the boundaries of what is sexually appropriate and what isn't, because the person who abused them taught them that these boundaries aren't as secure as they thought. This is especially true if the person who abused them was a trusted adult.*  Dissociation and feeling ""disconnected"" from your body is very common, too. This is a defense mechanism that helps the mind feel safer when the body can't escape physical danger, or when emotions themselves start to feel ""unsafe."" This is part of the reason why substance abuse becomes a problem, is a craving for this disconnection from the body.  **How can you be supportive?**  If someone in your life tells you they have experienced sexual abuse, *listen to them fully*. Be gentle and understanding with them. Don't ask them any blaming questions (""how much were you drinking?"" ""why didn't you leave?"" etc.) or ask for specific details. Let them share these if they want to. Respect their boundaries, especially physical and sexual boundaries. Consent is very important in helping them feel safe and comfortable.  Not that anyone here needs to hear this, but just in case: Don't blame them, and don't say or imply that they just need to ""get over it."" That's the quickest way to lose a friend and make them feel even worse.  Let them know you're there for them and that you care about them. Let them know they can always reach out, and try to check in with them from time to time and make sure they're okay. Ask them what they need, and give it to them if you can.  For more info, you should check out [RAINN's ""How to Help a Loved One"" page]( There are some more great tips on here to help you feel prepared.  **Healing From Sexual Abuse**  There's no easy answer for this one. Everyone will feel and respond differently, because every individual and their experiences are going to be unique to them. Overall, the best odds are a combination of talk therapy and medication, but not everyone will need to take medications. Talk therapy using CBT and DBT have been effective, and EMDR has had some great results, too. Recreational forms of therapy can also be beneficial.  There is no timeline for healing. You could go to therapy for a few months and be fine, or you could go to therapy for years and still be struggling. Everyone is on their own schedule, and the only person that gets to decide when they feel ""okay"" is the person who had the experience.  **What if you've experienced sexual abuse?**  If you've had your own experiences with sex abuse, I am so sorry about what you went through. Please know that it was not your fault, and you did not deserve that. If you don't have one already, you should consider talking to a therapist. Ideally, you'll want someone licensed, with experience working with survivors of sexual abuse. You might also want to check out RAINN (link below) for additional resources.  **As for Drake Bell...**  Drake has described experiencing many of these symptoms, either in the doc or in the subsequent podcasts. I've really enjoyed hearing him talk about his experiences in therapy, and it sounds like he's really been finding it helpful. Additionally, he seems to be very good at expressing himself in a creative way (both of which are considered ""protective factors,"" which are basically exactly what they sound like), and as far as supports go, his dad seems like an awesome guy, and when he talks about his love for his son, it's brought me to tears. I would be really hopeful that he feels like he can can get to a place where he feels ""healed,"" whatever that means for him.  I don't think he owes us any more details than what we've already learned, but I am glad he's been so transparent, and I hope others gain confidence from hearing his story. I have also really enjoyed hearing about his recovery, and I hope this also proves to be helpful in showing others that this is possible for them, too.  **Sources/Resources:**   \* [NAMI has a pretty thorough and easy to understand description of PTSD]( as well as many other mental health conditions. If you want accurate and easy to understand info on mental health, NAMI is a great place to start.  \* [RAINN]( has some excellent resources, including a crisis and chat line.  \* [Nadine Burke's TED Talk on the ACEs Study]( goes further into discussion about how trauma affects a child's development, physical health, and their overall life outcome.  \* [The CDC's webpage on the ACEs study]( is a great overview of the study's data and what it means.  \* “The Body Keeps the Score” by Bessel van der Kolk is an awesome and very informative book about the history of how PTSD came to be recognized, how trauma physically affects the body, the theory behind C-PTSD as a diagnosis, and some of the ways we can treat these conditions.  \* ""A Practical Guide to Complex PTSD: Compassionate Strategies to Begin Healing from Childhood Trauma"" by Dr. Arielle Schwartz has some excellent info on C-PSTD specifically.  &#x200B;  I hope this helps someone! ❤  &#x200B;  **\*\*Edited to add the two paragraphs written in italics, I realized I had left out a couple of key pieces!

"Drake Bell is Atoning For His Crimes Which Is More Than We Can Say For Brian Peck What happened to Drake is far worse than what he actually did.  I’m not saying it absolves him. Yeah, Drake messed up in his life and made some bad choices for sure, but my understanding of his situation was that he flirted with a girl online and sent her some racy pictures, not knowing she was underage. He broke it off when he learned her real age which she took very badly and had a vendetta. Maybe she had crazy parents and blamed him so that she could distance herself from any shame, wouldn’t be punished or branded a “whore.”  If something else comes out, I’ll update my thoughts. As I understand it, it’s more of a he-said-she-said. Not nearly as bad if you ask me.  I’m sure that due to our culture’s history of downplaying abuse towards minors, and everything that was coming out about bigger guys like Weinstein, Cosby, Louis CK etc, when the press got wind, they interpreted the story in the worst possible way, doing irreparable damage to his reputation. A lot of misinformation was printed. And a lot of people bring their own baggage when they interpret a more ambiguous story.  I am saying that even if Drake was guilty, it was for something far less severe and he actually did his time and served his probation. He owned up to his mistake. He even served his full time, which is way more than can be said about Brian Peck. And with the public against him for so long and bringing up all his misdeeds at every turn, I’d say he paid his debt with interest.  Brian Peck was a convicted abusive rapist and p3do guilty of physical and emotional abuse on many levels. He was one step removed from being a serial killer in his own right. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was. There’s no way Drake was his only victim.   Our help for trauma recovery is terrible even for mild stuff. How could someone reasonably recover from something like that so quickly with no hiccups having so few real resources, especially has a public figure subject to more severe scrutiny and more exposure to leeches and predators?  I’m all for accountability and responsibility but Drake seems to really be taking it. I’m personally willing to forgive anyone who does that and not brand them with their sins if they are truly atoning and trying to do better.  I wasn’t the girl in that story and can’t speak for her. Just an audience member who likes Drake’s work. Whether she forgives him or not is up to her. I’m willing to forgive Drake since he owned up to his own mistakes and failings in such a big way and really working on healing.  It’s crazy how people will treat Drake’s crime as Brian Peck level, but not actually prosecute the actual Brian Pecks or their enablers.",belgeselsever,1c0ufor

"Going after other former child actors takes away from the real perpetrators I think it’s been enough said that going after other former child actors to speak on the abuse that may have happened to them is sick. People commenting nonstop and coaxing them, as if we are owed their traumas for entertainment, in the guise of “for the good of everyone”. In reality it is more out of sensationalism than out of genuine concern.   But also, villainising some on the speculations of taking hush money, when they themselves might have also been victims. I’ve seen too many comments like x and y sold themselves for fame, they are not taking the side of the victims for not speaking out, they are phony, etc., as if they were willing “participants” of the abuse, or had any agency as children.    (And even if they did take hush money, I don’t see it as a reflection of them enabling the horrific things that happened? Some probably took it as consolation. Knowing that the system was too broken and too corrupt at that point, one could come to the conclusion, that might as well get something for the trauma endured or the parents might have made that decision for them.)  One of the grossest comments I have seen, with many people even agreeing, was someone like Ariana having sold herself and even seduced adults for fame. Also always contrasting her with Victoria who allegedly turned down Dan and thus didn’t have a successful music career. It was bordering slut shaming… slut shaming a child and victim. Another one is Josh, for not being close to Drake prior and now has reached out after watching the documentary. And then Amanda, who has already gone through so many things. And so many others that are being badgered about this.   My point is, going after other former child stars and potential victims is taking away from the point of the documentary, and the real perpetrators. Instead of going after Brian Peck, Dan Schneider, and many other ADULTS who were complicit, you are going after people who were already failed by the system and the adults that were supposed to protect them.",belgeselsever,1bl039e

"Dan Schneider Knew I think what Drake may not have realized (as I watched his remarks on Dan, specifically Dan’s support) is that Dan already knew what was happening, during and/or even before it happened. Someone on ticktoc raised the point that a small person like Brian especially in the pecking order would have to feel safe and backed by a more powerful person to feel emboldened enough to execute his heinous crimes and thoughts. Whether or not Dan outrightly knew, from one pervert to another he knew.   I’d also like to add that I think Brian Peck had gotten away with molesting the more vulnerable boys. Drake states that his family never relied on him for financial support and he also had a very active father who was outspoken about the pedophilliac tendencies of Brian he observed. To this end, I think he viewed Drake as a challenge-as we see with how he targets him over the course of years and destroys and infiltrates trust within the family.",belgeselsever,1bmtdib
"Stop shaming potential victims for not speaking up In a recent podcast interview with Sarah Fraser, Drake Bell talked about how another documentary reached out to him in the past about speaking about his childhood sexual abuse, and Drake said no. The creators of that documentary then shamed him for saying no and basically said that “people like him were why bad things keep happening”. The experience left Drake Bell feeling really anxious about speaking out and it took a long time before he was comfortable speaking out for Quiet on Set.  So, we can all look at this past situation Drake went through and go “oh that’s disgusting!” so… why are people doing the same to other potential victims/survivors? If the celebrity has come out and said the allegations against Dan Schneider and Nickelodeon are false, then go ahead and drag them. But shaming potential victims for not speaking up just feels… wrong. They aren’t evil for not speaking out. They might not feel ready right now or they might never feel ready and that’s okay.

"Drake talked on a podcast ""Josh worked on The Amanda Show, so he saw and knew what was going on. But I appreciate that he reached out to me privately and didn’t go straight to the media because he was there with me and saw what I was going through.”  “I don’t think he knew specifics, but there were people who worked on the show that knew who it was. He just knew how sensitive this was for me and after watching the documentary, he learned so much that I had gone through and I think he was just so sensitive and made sure to reach out to me privately rather than just going straight to social media.”   “I think Brian was able to pull the wool over a lot of people’s eyes and paint a picture that was a far cry from reality.”   So people on the Amanda show knew that something was very weird and no adult was able to help this kid?",belgeselsever,1bu6epb

People pick apart scenes that dont necessarily have any deep or hidden meanings. Its obvious that Dan has put in numerous of sexual jokes into his shows. Im not arguing with that.

Amanda Bynes Watching the documentary just made me feel bad for everyone involved especially Amanda Bynes. She was my Nickelodeon crush when I was a kid but its just to sad to see her current state.

Do you think she is genuine in that statement or is her parents fault that she is at the state she is at right now? I hope she is mentally and physically doing well.,belgeselsever,1brrwic
"Is it just me or is there not enough attention on the Drake Bell situation? I’ve been seeing so many YouTube videos and TikToks talking mainly about Dan Schneider. I completely understand that he’s the biggest name in this situation outside of the child actors. And don’t get me wrong Dan is absolute scum, a terrible person and a creepy fuck. It just doesn’t feel like there’s really enough focus on the proven pedophiles that worked for Nickelodeon.  Even in the documentary, the fact that there were 3 registered sex offenders working for Nickelodeon at the time was so quickly talked about and kind of brushed past I think.   EDIT : I’m coming from an outside perspective, I’ve done a decent bit of research but I’m not trying to say the documentary/media outlets aren’t talking about Drake and the underlying issues with Nickelodeon as a whole. I just feel like the content covering it is being suppressed, and without looking for it you see mainly Dan focused content probably due to subject matter and censoring.",belgeselsever,1bubsbe
"My research into Brian Peck's background, including new information I found about him that hasn't been reported on before. (Long post) I've seen many people question where Brian came from or how he as a Z-list actor had such influence/power to basically being an American Jimmy Saville so here's some stuff I found. This is basically about understanding the why, I also found a lot of stuff that hasn't been brought up previously.  **Early life.**  [  In this interview Peck talks about his childhood. He confirms he was an only child. Says he developed a weird, vivid (probably perverted) imagination in his youth and this led to him wanting to be an actor. He also loved horror and built models of movies monsters as a child.  [  He was reportedly born in Indiana but may have moved to California as a teenager, he talks about his 18th birthday happening in Los Angeles.   He also claims he went to high school with Doug Benson, who did grow up in California and attended Grossmont High School in San Diego, so presumably that's where Brian went to high school. (Source: Love Horror interview)  [  Side note, I'm pretty sure in one of the defence letters the guy talked about Peck and him being friends as children but I can't find it, perhaps I'm mixed up with another case?   [  Brian was a theatre major at USC (University as Southern California) he describes himself at the time as ""*a spoiled preppy guy going to an expensive college in the theater department. I was more likely wearing Sergio Valente jeans and a lavender polo shirt with my nicely coiffed brown hair""* Patrick Bateman vibes.   **Early Career**  Will not go too much in depth as this is stuff you already know. His first role was The Last American Virgin when he was about 22 (Where he met his closest confidant, Kimmy Robertson) this is what he looked like back then.   [  Brian had a rift with his agent, who he felt kept putting him up for shitty roles (which wasn't good for his raging narcissism). His agent wouldn't put him up for Return of the Living Dead bc he didn't think it was right for him   Interestingly enough, he got the role in ROTLD because of Kimmy Robertson who was up to audition for it and suggested him to producers personally and they decided to cast him based on her recommendation. Brian fired his agent after this.   Brian was extremely enthusiastic on set, and turned up on his days off just to hang out which made the rest of the cast and crew fond of him. He also helped out in the art department for fun and also played extra roles if needed. This led him to get guest roles in all future Living Dead movies.   He also was close with Kenny Myers, prolific SFX makeup artist, who he wrote a script with but Kenny stopped working on him with it and he pitched it to producers on his own (they didn't like it), perhaps a rift between them. (Source: Uneeda interview)  [  This interview is crazy because he skirts right over the rape scandal. The interviewer asks him what he's been doing after ROTLD, this is his response. Conveniently no mention of The Amanda Show and a very suspicious ""Since 2005...""   *I have continued acting here and there, wrote and directed a little film titled “The Willies” in 1990, and shortly after “Return” became an acting coach and dialog coach helping the actors with their lines on the show “Growing Pains”. I have done that job many times since on shows such as “The Mommies”, “Boy Meets World”, “What I like About You”, several Nickelodeon Network shows and films like “Holes”. Since 2005 I have also been a producer on the films “Outlaw Trail”, “Forever Strong and “Bitch Slap”.*  This is also interesting bc he isn't credited on The Mommies on his IMDB page, this was a 1993-1995 show.   **Other interesting information**  [  Brian confirms he was out of prison in August 2005! Meaning he served less than 10 months of his 16 months sentence. He also tells a story about a clerk at a hardware store (He doesn't fail to mention the clerk was a male of about 20 years old) who asked him ""why does the name Brian Peck sound familiar to me?"" when he saw his credit card, Brian was bricking it and the clerk said ""Oh, you were in the living dead!""   [  Also would like to note this blog post from 2017; they took down their interview with Brian after being informed of what he did which they genuinely didn't know about. They warn others not to interview him.   In the Uneeda interview, he (possibly) alludes to his relationship with Drake. Don't have exact date, but he was working on Holes at the time so presumably 2002-2003, so this is likely about him.   *One of the actors on a Nickelodeon show I worked with heard about it, how good it was and that I was in it. So he came to my house and we ordered pizza and watched it.*  Shameless.",belgeselsever,1c275pr

"It's interesting to think the current and next generations of child stars won't be on Nickelodeon or Disney Channel... They're going to be (or already are) on YouTube, TikTok, and whatever videos sites take off in the future. Go ahead and laugh all you want at the notion of ""influencers"" and family vloggers mattering, but the biggest child and teen personalities on YouTube probably have more fans than the young stars of ""Raven's Home"" ever did.  These sites (and streaming in general) have replaced basic cable in the minds of young people. My mother works with kids, and almost none of the kids she's worked with in the last decade have a strong connection to Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, or Cartoon Network. (Don't forget, a decade ago was 2015, just after the streaming disruption really took hold.)  Obviously, I'm simplifying things here, and those networks are trying to keep their names alive on the streaming services their parent companies own. Nickelodeon and Disney haven't stopped making sitcoms with kids, but most of them are reboots, and none of them have had the impact of the originals. The ""All That"" reboot (remember that?) sure didn't create any stars.  Maybe that's a good thing... but I'm not sure that being a famous minor online is automatically better. I just read [an article on Vulture]( about the parents of online child stars moving to other states in order to avoid laws requiring them to not spend all the money their children make. In general, adults making their children the primary breadwinner of a household is a dangerous move---that's what first spoiled the relation between Macauley Culkin and his parents, to name just one example.  TLDR: The heyday of Nickelodeon is behind us, but the new age of child fame will retain most of the old pitfalls.",belgeselsever,1j4lj3x
"Was “Amanda please” a word play on “a man to please”? Or are we just reaching? i recently saw a tiktok comment claiming that “amanda please” is just a play on the phrase “a man to please.” my initial reaction was that this is a reach and a little ridiculous, but then when i considered the fact that schneider shamelessly named the character penelope “taynt”, and that her character was always saying some variation of “i’m looking for amanda please” “i’m trying to find amanda please” “where’s amanda please” it *does* seem somewhat plausible to me that it was intentional. either way, i’ll never be able to hear “amanda please” the same again.    so what do you guys think? just another creepy, sexual joke woven into the amanda show, or just a coincidence that we’re looking into too much?    edit just to be absolutely clear because apparently my post was very very confusing...   the fact that “amanda please” sounds like “a man to please” is an undebatable fact. whether or not it was intentionally done is what i, and many others, are speculating.    the idea that dan schneider would happily name the character penelope taynt but would absolutely never ever in a million years also give that character inappropriate catchphrases is a logical fallacy imo.    if you disagree that’s fine but acting like this is some malicious, nefarious, evil conspiracy theory is just weird and disingenuous.    personally i have been really appalled by people demanding statements from potential victims,  making this whole thing into entertainment etc. that is not what i intended to do with this post in any way shape or form. it is **a fact** that these nickelodeon shows had a slew of inappropriate, disturbing, sexual jokes in them. i was just suggesting that “amanda please” could be one of those jokes.",belgeselsever,1bndsme

I’m talking specifically about Amanda Bynes and Drake Bell who both famously went totally off the rails. I realise DUI’s etc are the fault of the individual, but I’m talking more about orchestration of online and offline smear campaigns against these people in order to perhaps discredit them. A few years ago Amanda was consistently ridiculed and publicly humiliated due to her personal problems, which the press always managed to get wind of. Drake mentioned in the doc that he noticed totally fabricated articles popping up about him which seemed to come from nowhere.

Brian’s incessant phone calls in the story Drake told suggested to me that there was an important arrangement that Drake was missing.   And most importantly is the sweetheart plea deal that Brian got. With those charges, catching less than 2 years would suggest to me that he was given a favorable deal in order to make it go away without a trial that would create a lot of noise and implicate co-conspirators.

It was really sus that Dan just seemingly knew it was Drake that had been abused by Brian, right?! Like, Drake talks about Dan reaching out to ask him almost like Dan was being supportive, but there's nothing that really suggests that he was supportive after that... that he reached out to ask if Drake was the victim seems more like Dan was tryna navigate who was ""safe"" to operate around and was checking if his assumptions that Drake was no longer a ""safe"" victim were right or not. From what Kyle Sullivan said about him questioning the All That cast, it sounds like Dan was looking for whistle-blowers, rather than victims to support - if that makes sense... it's just left me with so many questions and such a bad taste, and I don't understand how nobody is questioning it more tbh, including Drake! Also that Dan approached Drake to question that at all was just so unbelievably inappropriate anyway. He was supposed to be a minor protected by anonymity!

I know this is a difficult time, but is it really in his best interest to go so public with all of this trauma so fast? He only went to rehab LAST YEAR. That’s so extremely recent that I’m starting to worry that the reality of going so public maybe hasn’t hit yet. I just hope he has a good support system and is doing as well as he can be in this situation.

"Drake's podcast appearances make his mom's actions more understandable I watched the doc recently and came to check if a new episode would come out and saw the post on the front page. I was also confused by his mom, but after listening to some of Drake's post-interview talks I understood her better.  I think it's important to understand what she was thinking so that we can avoid the same traps and keep our own kids safe. The info is mostly from [this podcast]( and the Not Skinny but Not Fat podcast.  I'll phrase this in terms of questions I asked myself and the answers I learned.  Did Drake's mom push him into acting?  * No. Drake's mom was financially independent. Drake's dad found the audition advertisement (while in the waiting room for marriage counseling) and suggested it to Drake. He stepped back in his career to support Drake's, which is what Brian took advantage of.   When Drake asked to cut off his dad because he thought he was stealing from him, why didn't Drake's mom check the financial logs?  * The logs sound complex and, this being the early 2000s, a lot of it was probably done through cash and checks. Drake's dad was paying for rent, headshots, agents, and more out of Drake's salary. Unless Drake's dad took very careful notes this could quickly become financial spaghetti.   Why did Drake's mom trust Brian?   * Drake had already been over to Brian's house several times with his dad and with friends. Drake felt comfortable with Brian and at his house, and even after cutting off his dad Drake hung out with and slept at Brian's many times safely before the abuse started. This was a case of a family friend and mentor turning abusive after gaining the parents' trust.  Why was Drake's mom too lazy to drive Drake herself?  * She wasn't, but she lived an hour away in Orange County, owned a small business, traveled for work, and had 2 other children to take care of. Brian started by offering rides and led up to offering to let him sleep over.  Why did Drake's gf's mom figure it out so quickly when Drake's mom didn't?  * Drake's gf's mom took longer than depicted in the documentary. Brian personally showed up to the gf's home several times. Drake's gf began asking him why Brian was so attached to him. Her mom didn't like it but still allowed it and Drake, Brian, and Drake's gf all hung out together occasionally.    * Also, Drake consciously hid the abuse from his mom. He thought that if his mom noticed any problems and found out he wouldn't be allowed to act anymore.  * On the day the gf's mom questioned him, the gf was actually the one who ripped the phone out and started demanding that Drake tell her what was going on. That's when her mom came out and asked to speak to Drake in the kitchen.   Did the therapist figure anything out?  * Drake hid the abuse from the therapist as well (which makes it more understandable that he was able to hide it from his mom). The abuse continued and he continued to date his gf until Brian wanted a role on Drake & Josh.   * At this point Drake confessed to his gf who encouraged him to tell an adult. Drake finally called his mom who immediately called the police.    Does Drake still have a good relationship with his mom?  * Yes he says that they have a great relationship and that she is one of the few people he can trust. He doesn't resent her and he doesn't think his dad does either. He thinks she may have been able to do more but it's things that are easy to see in hindsight and not at the time.",belgeselsever,1buy9zn
"Jonathan Brandis connection? So, watching the documentary I couldn´t help but to think back to the 90s actor Jonathan Brandis and his death by suicide in 2003. To this day there's no real explanation as to why he did it. His father has said Jonathan had symptoms of bipolar disorder, and I remember the idea of it having been caused by some sort of medication he was taking could be a factor as well. People said he was depressed because he wasn´t getting work as an adult man, and that after his huge popularity as a teen in the 90s he just couldn´t take having been cast aside by the industry.  However, what I was thinking is he may have been carrying some dark experiences as well. Admittedly these are rumors that have been doing the rounds online for a while but, it is said that he and Leonardo DiCaprio really didn´t get along/didn´t like each other. Leonardo DiCaprio called him a rival or competitor at some point, and people actually criticized him for talking about Jonathan's death in an insensitive manner at one point. The really creepy rumor is that apparently Brandis commited suicide the day after attending Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday party (November 12), and some say something unknown happened there that pushed him to the edge.   Strangely, the connection between the two actors has never gotten much attention even when people discuss the details of Brandis' death. On the one hand it seems odd that Brandis would attend DiCaprio's party if they didn´t like each other, and on the other it is very creepy that he seemingly got to his breaking point on the next day.

"Positives of last episode If you go into episode 5 expecting it to be an epilogue in follow-up to the original documentary, rather than a fifth installment of the documentary, it is really quite good.  This episode gave the actors whose interviews were recorded over a year ago the opportunity to reply to the public response.  Drake got to address his post-interview revelations about the impact of the trauma on his life, all the criticism of his mom, and his current relationships with people who defended of Peck.  We got to hear a heartwarming story of Bryan and his mom overcoming an estrangement that so many parents of young actors never get to have, *as a result of the documentary*.  We saw how the documentary inspired others to speak up about their experiences of discomfort on set.    The piece on racism and advice for young black actors was also very important.  Nickelodeon has always had lots of young black actors in their shows, but so what?  When the black kids on set were expected to just be grateful to be there, and punished for speaking up or having parents who speak up, its just more of the exploitative dynamic that should be called out.  I loved what Bryan’s mom gave for advice:  take the opportunities, but also be willing to walk away if you have to.    I find it kind of disturbing that so many people are simply calling for more salacious stories, and seem disappointed that this episode wasn’t more scandalous.",belgeselsever,1byynq1

"What did Drake Bell do? From the documentary, a lot has been unearthed about the very unfortunate past of Drake Bell. After watching a couple interviews with him after the documentary came out, I want to better understand what allegations were made against him, and who made them.  The most common story I’ve run across thus far is that Drake Bell engaged in a sexual relationship of some kind with a minor. However I’ve also heard this claim be disproved numerous times, with Drake claiming the two had never had any kind of personal contact (exempting his concerts that she had attended which occurred years after the messages were exchanged), and that he had cut off contact with her the moment he came to find out that she was a minor. I have also heard the allegations she made against him, with her saying he sexually assaulted her numerous times at multiple concerts and sent sexually explicit texts and messages while knowing her age (though this could not be corroborated by any of the individuals who accompanied her to the concerts).  To me this seems like a pretty cut and dry case. The girl had a history of lying and stalking and no images were found on either device after a 3 year investigation. I understand that he plead guilty to child endangerment (NOT sexual misconduct) because his lawyers advised him that it would be the lightest sentence and the least sensational. The story was then misrepresented by the media (the NYT has retracted several of the statements made about his status as a sex offender).  Now what I’m confused by is I’ve seen so many comments be made about Drake Bell being a predator. Am I missing something or have people simply been mislead by the media? I feel so terrible for the guy to have so much of his adult life constantly be reported on in such a negative light - especially now knowing what we know about his adolescence.",belgeselsever,1bnqjo7

Sumner was also the one that brought in Dan. There was a video made by Michael Bower who was a child actor on Saluate your shorts in the beginning of nickelodeons. He stated that one of the higher up of nickelodeon, who he wasn't 100% sure he did anything, so he didn't want to mention his name; the higher up took Michael and a Co star to places and eventually invited them to his hotel for popcorn and ice cream. They were excited and felt comfortable so they went but the man brought out alcohol and the co star contacted his parent and they came to get them..... he did mention that this man was the one that brought in Dan......

"Brian Peck supporters…UGH!! I wanted to give those stars a hug, especially Amanda Bynes (she deserves the world) and Drake Bell. I honestly can’t remember the last time I’ve lost so much respect for people all at once until I watched this documentary.   Kimmy Robertson was especially VILE!!! Textbook victim shaming right there. Children don’t “want” or “ask” to be violated!!! They’re either forced or manipulated. Even if Drake “came onto him”, Brian would still be a predator for engaging in it! It’s called GROOMING!! Drake was a CHILD! Brian was an ADULT! No matter how much she wanted to spin it, Brian still SA’d Drake. Homosexuality is not a disability or illnesses. Brian had no less impulse control than he would if he were straight. It’s scary and infuriating that her level of delulu actually fucking exists.   Joanna Kerns’ letter and her claiming that she was “misinformed” and wouldn’t have sent her letter if she “knew what she knows now” made me feel like I just got dumber. Like that basically translates to “if I had known I was gonna be exposed for supporting a pedophile, I wouldn’t have sent that letter”. Otherwise, she’s fucking oblivious. I mean, what “misinformation” do you need to come to the conclusion that a child “tempted” a filthy grown ass man?! Stupid af.   These 41 supporters clearly believed that Brian was being inappropriate with a child. They just didn’t want to. They wanted to believe he was somehow a victim!! Yeah I can’t imagine how much he “suffered” when he was when he was actually staring justice in the face for touching and raping a child.   Also, manipulating and stalking a child, turning him against his father when he was trying to protect him, and robbing that child of his innocence in the worst possible way is not a fucking mistake or “misjudgment” as Taran Killam called it! He calculated the fuck out of this. Literally nothing Brian Peck did warranted anything less than jail time, so they can all fuck off with probation. Even if Brian beat around the bush, he still admitted to having sexual contact with a MINOR! I mean, come on. Anybody in their right mind would know that all you need to hear is “I was inappropriate with a minor” to know what a disgusting lump of shit that person is and how deplorable it is to support them. “i DoN’t CoNdOnE wHaT hE dId”. But you were willing to forgive him for crimes that weren’t yours to forgive.   Even the supporters who have expressed remorse publicly still have given Drake no apologies whatsoever, not after court or after the letters were released (edit: I know about Rider Strong apologizing to Drake, which is awesome. Kudos to him). Brian taking them on a trip to La La Land doesn’t excuse the shit they said, especially when they couldn’t be bothered to get the facts first. People like them are part of the reason why Drake (like other child stars) never got the justice he deserved.",belgeselsever,1btc159

"These letters get worse and worse I see a lot of people bringing up more letters, and I wanted to bring attention to the letter Thomas DeSanto wrote in support of Brian. Some of the things he says is quite disturbing.  He writes, “It was my observation that Drake was dealing with a lot of personal issues and Brian was someone he could talk to. Drake seemed to be acting one way in front of his family, and another around his friends, co-workers, and classmates. This included having lunch with Brian, Drake, and someone Drake referred to as his boyfriend, yet he was unable to introduce his boyfriend to his family. Drake also seemed to be very fearful of his father and unable to communicate with him whatever sexual issues he was going through at the time.”  This just makes me wonder how much Brian was skewing these stories to these letter writers. Why would Thomas explain that Drake had a boyfriend and was scared on telling his family? And another example like Kimmy’s where Drake is being described as “sexual” at only 15 years old.   Thomas also states that if he ever had children that he would have no issues with leaving them under Brian’s care, which is utterly concerning.",belgeselsever,1c17x8s
"Absolutely heartbreaking… I remember having a biiig crush on Drake Bell as a teenager – had posters of him hanging everywhere in my room and watched every interview with him. I've known him mainly from Drake & Josh since this was the only show being aired in German tv (we didn't have The Amanda Show or at least I can't remember).  –– Spoilers if you haven't watched all episodes yet ––  Watching ""Quiet On Set"" with Drake Bell, revealing what had happened to him, was absolutely devastating to hear. I can't believe that this, along with so many other things that probably are still in the dark, happened behind the scenes. It breaks my heart listening to him recount the events. He was such a big part of my childhood, and this has really opened my eyes more to what really goes on in this world. I know I probably shouldn't feel so emotionally invested in this, but ""Drake & Josh"" was a significant part of my childhood, so thirteen-year-old me is shocked to her core.",belgeselsever,1butxjb
Dan Schneider Shows He makes shows that cater to two audiences at the same time. Children and pedophiles. That’s why his shows had such good ratings they were bringing in a whole new crowd that Nickelodeon wasn’t use to but they would do anything to keep the extra views so they didn’t care how they were getting them. I seen Alexa Nikolas talking about how some clips from his shows can be found on child p*rn websites and that’s very telling. He new exactly what he was doing. On the amandaplease website he has videos titles “Amanda’s body parts” “Amanda’s feet” a game called “name that body part” with pictures of then 13 year old  Amanda. Thank god all of the video links have been broken but the titles and website can still be found. Dan new exactly what he was doing the whole time. He worked with and was friends with pedophiles.

"Overall Incredible Honestly, I had a mother that grew up knowing the industry and wasn’t shy about pointing out what lurked in the darkness. She struggled when I took my first headshots because she knew what happened in the background.  I remember I was around their age (most of the cast being interviewed) (and of course I had a major crush on Drake Bell) and my mom saw him on TV and said, “there’s something wrong there - something’s going on with him”.  Of course as my crush I shrugged it off but then years later when other things hit the media, my mom used the term “hurt baby”. And suddenly I had an idea of what she meant.  I saw the documentary and the worst part about the last episode was giving most of the credit to the others joining with their little insights. There were hurt babies there - not just hurt feelings.  He’s my crush even more now than then for being strong and healed (just) enough to try to help others. Pain like that takes a lot of healing - and it’s never over. I know that well.  I don’t think this documentary could’ve happened without that sort of bravery and necessary sacrifice of pride (no disrespect to any other person in the series). I hope this opens the eyes of everyone that’s seen it but overall I hope people that really endured do get some sort of closure. And those that caused that pain never get the opportunity to cause it again.",belgeselsever,1bzf2wx

Tbh, I think it’s very important that we touch on diversity (or lack thereof) in this industry, but I feel like they could’ve used some stronger examples, if not elaborated further on what made certain parts racist. Otherwise, it just sounded as if they were reaching. Also, I think they should’ve started with the racial diversity discussion and interviewed Drake towards the end. I don’t think we should dismiss the trauma of other Nickelodeon stars because of how dark Drake’s story is, but he was molested by a well-respected (at the time), powerful (and also manipulative) figure in this industry! It doesn’t mean other former Nickelodeon stars weren’t traumatized, nor does it mean that their trauma is invalid. Drake’s is just different and the darkest. Not to mention, up until episode 2, we had no idea that Drake was the John Doe from Brian Peck’s case in 2003. His story was very prominent in this documentary! Also, I would’ve liked to hear more from Shane Lyons, assuming there’s more to it than Brian Peck telling him a dirty joke. They should’ve given him more time to express his thoughts and tell his story. This episode just felt rushed and pretty dry. Furthermore, it could’ve been structured better than it was.

"Every adult on the set of the amanda show is to blame I’ve been thinking about this, and how Brian Peck basically calculated a smooth transition into Drake’s life. He swooped him in his reel by showing an interest in Drake’s interest, old film, and opened a door into Drake’s every day life. He was basically hovering over Drake all on set and even helping him get costumes on for bits. Drake’s dad AND a producer on set said that Brian was a very “touchy feely guy.” The video of young Leo with Peck was the same behavior he had with Drake. Constantly touching him, and never leaving his side. Dan had a feeling Drake was involved in Brian’s case and Drake said it was probably because Brian’s grooming of Drake on set was so obvious. Drake was only 14/15 at the time of this, he was only a child and had no idea that the behavior Brian had was inappropriate. But the adults knew of this very well. Drake’s dad knew, producers knew, and Dan knew too. Drake’s dad tried to step in but it didn’t go well, I don’t know why Dan didn’t bother to get Brian to stop if he had a feeling something was up. Dan was the most powerful person in that room, he could’ve easily got a handle of the obvious situation, so why didn’t he?

Now, after watching the doccumentary, I can´t stop but to wonder if Drake was scared of saying anything because he was aware of Brian's affinity for a serial killer- from what we hear, Brian was all too happy to boast about his friendship with Gacy and show off that painting and the letters he had from him. I don´t know if Brian would explain people who Gacy was and what he did, but even if he didn´t, people would've found out, right? So, they suddenly would be in a situation in which they know they are in close contact with the friend of a serial killer, someone who likes and admires a murderer, and that may have had, I imagine, a hand in keeping them scared and quiet, because they had no choice but to be around him because of their work?      Moreover, how many victims are still silent because they're scared of more serious consequences than merely losing their jobs? I'm not saying Brian is or must be a killer himself, but he's obviously a seriously disturbed individual and to a victim's mind, it probably wouldn´t be much of a stretch to think they themselves might be in danger if they make an enemy out of him?      &#x200B;",belgeselsever,1btll8u

"Brian’s friends need prison time Does anyone wonder what ever happened to Brian’s friends, and who might they be? Brian’s friends were pedos as well, because Brian talked to them about Drake. They showed up to the strawberry festival with Brian and all of them creepily followed Drake around. Plus, on Drakes birthday, Brian’s friends (which I don’t understand why they were invited if it was supposed to be Drake’s party), left extremely inappropriate and graphic messages in their birthday cards to Drake. Not to mention the night Drake was at his girlfriend’s house and he was supposed to be with Brian at Disneyland, Brian’s friends were also there wanting Drake to come. The little pedo posse that Brian went around with creeps me out, and how he got them in on being interested in Drake. It makes me grateful that Drake got out of that situation when he did, because it probably would’ve only gotten worse. I just wish these friends were outted too, I’m sure they’re out being total creeps to this day.",belgeselsever,1bswl13
"Why didn’t they talk about more? I don’t mean more explicitly go into detail of what happened, but genuinely there was more to some of these stories that they didn’t mention.   For example, the [vine]( Jeanette McCurdy posted once addressing Dan and how she knows he watches her vines. The last second is her saying, “look what you’ve done to me.” I remember when this was posted, this was how I fell into the Dan rabbit hole which was why I was so happy this documentary was being made. And because that vine was such a turning point in our public perception of Dan, I’m surprised they didn’t bring it up.   Surprised they didn’t bring up the Zoey 101 rumors that Dan was the one to get her pregnant as well, but I suppose that could get them sued. However I do wish they let Alexa Nikolas share how horrible of a working environment it was like Jamie Lynn Spears asking her sister to bully her, which Britney then talked about in her book and apologized for.   On the other hand, I learned a lot about the writers room and heard from folks who I never heard from before and was happy they felt safe to share their story and I thank them for that.   I’m wondering if there’s anything else you may know that wasn’t brought up in the doc.

"Soledad O'Brien The tone of the interviewer in episode 5 was the reason I stopped watching after 15 minutes. Her tone, and the whole style of this episode was such a departure from episodes 1-4. It felt like I was watching a news channel in the 2000s. The number of times she said stuff like, ""we'll be right back"". Right back where? I'm streaming this show online 🤣 Maybe they wrote this episode differently because it gives the actors time to reflect, since the doc came out. And I understand it's probably been a long time since they filmed episodes 1-4. But from the audience's perspective, we've all just binged episodes 1-4 in quick succession and episode 5 came out a couple of weeks later. It's as if the writers didn't even think about the audience's perspective. And they somehow forgot that viewers are streaming this show online, not watching on the 6 o'clock news.

"Leo DiCaprio: the missing link ? After finishing Quiet on Set, I decided to do a deeper dive into the early careers of some of the people more briefly mentioned in the series. It seems that they drop in that video of Leo and Br*an but almost never mention it again. Seems odd considering this mention is used as a comparison to how Peck treated young boys on set such as Drake Bell. It seems to me that a potential conclusion we could draw is that Bell was not Peck’s first victim, but rather the only one who would come forward. This explains why out of the several heinous crimes Peck was charged with, he is only convicted of two most related to Bell, though bell claims that in a recorded phone call, he gives a “full confession.” It seems this is then a “admit what you can’t deny, deny what you can’t admit” scenario, in which he knew the Bell crimes could be proven, but others who wouldn’t come forward could be swept under the rug—can’t prove, so it didn’t happen, right?  Overall, I don’t say this to speculate wildly, but rather shed more light on the insidiousness and coverups that are already evidently at play here. DiCaprio’s wiki bio demonstrates that he had many of the same vulnerabilities that Bell had early in his career — a deep desire to work in entertainment met with the immense pressure of being the sole breadwinner of the family.",belgeselsever,1bio6cj

"Perception versus reality my friend So after watching the documentary and various other interviews with Drake Bell, I felt like writing this to invite others to reflect on a couple things.   I was a huge fan of Drake Bell when I was a teenager. I loved Drake and Josh, and I loved Drake's music; I lost my Mom at around the time It's Only Time came out and I remember listening to it and Telegraph a lot, and the songs really helped me through those tough times. I thought he was so cool and talented and handsome; I basically wanted to be him.   Eventually I started hearing about the DUIs, the tantrums on stage, the rumors about him being on drugs, being unstable and hard to work with...I was still understanding because I figured he had issues I just didn´t know about, but I did start becoming a bit disilusioned as a fan, to the point I was like, ""Oh yeah, Drake Bell... I was very into him years ago"". Then came the accusations of grooming, which was of course very sad to hear. And now that the documentary is out, I am reminiscing a lot about what he and his music meant to me, but also about how our perception of people can sometimes be very off.   What I'm getting at is that, other than the obvious things one concludes after watching the documentary, such as the need to protect children better, to bring justice, to change things in the industry and in society as a whole, etc, there's a couple lessons we can learn from this. One of them is that we should not be so quick to idealize others, or think of their life as perfect or charmed; I wanted to be Drake Bell, but now I realize being Drake Bell was not only not easy, it must have been a real nightmare at one point. When I watched his show or listened to his music, it really made me happy, and never imagined how much pain and rage and shame he was living with. The grass is greener and all that. Perception versus reality like he told Josh. We just never know what other people are going through. Sometimes, those people we really wish we could be, would perhaps wish they could be us to escape the horrible things in their actual, real life.   The other lesson then is to be compassionate to others, for the same reason; you just don´t know their struggle. Sometimes a small act of kindness can make all the difference for someone who doesn´t see anything but darkness at that moment. We have no idea how, in what way our actions, words, or creations impact others. Drake will likely never know how much his songs helped me during my late teens, when I was grieving. I wish I could tell him that in person. I'm sure I wouldn´t be the only one. I have no idea if he would care (I like to think he would), but all the same; we all have the power to change someone's life for the better in ways we can´t even imagine. Many times it will be unknowingly, but why not also try to do it knowingly, when we can.   So yeah, just my two cents...",belgeselsever,1bvgnuu

"I Can’t Rewatch any Nick Sitcoms Now Growing up I absolutely adored All That, The Amanda Show, Drake & Josh, Zoey 101, and ICarly. Like most people, I also aspired to be a Nick actor and be able to go on the sets and star in a sitcom. As I got older, I heard all the rumors and speculation of the undesirable work environments and practices at Nick. The hearsay was bad enough but, it’s a whole new level for all of it to be undeniably confirmed. I can not even begin to fathom the emotional toll the actors have and are still trying to shift through from their employment with the network. Watching this documentary really made me come to the realization of how perverted Nickelodeon was. I always remember thinking Nick was the more rebellious sister network to Disney. But after watching this doc, they would BLATANTLY “toe the line” between child friendly and straight up making content for mature audiences. Like when you really compare Nick to Disney sitcoms there were SO MANY innuendos when their targeted audience is such a young demographic. I know it’s not entirely uncommon for kids shows to have subtle adult themes and references to make it indirectly palatable to all audiences (for instance SpongeBob is marketed to children under 8 but has a “don’t drop the soap” joke) but Dan and the other writers REALLY took it to the extreme. I don’t think I have to give any further context because I’m sure any Nick viewer can recall an innuendo from any of the sitcoms in their body of work that was out of line. I was so heartbroken both watching and hearing Drake Bell and his father relive that devastating trauma (I’m sure we’re all aware of Drake Bell’s controversies but I feel like it’s very acceptable to sympathize with what happened to him when he was an innocent minor) and I think if the tv executives had a moral compass at all they should really pull the plug on the network because there’s far too much suffering attached to it. Nickelodeon and even some of their parents ALL failed those child stars and it’s super depressing to know they were enduring this while filming for our entertainment",belgeselsever,1bl9wd1

Look at Shia LaBeouf (Even Steven’s) Lee Thompson Young (Famous Jett Jackson) Orlando Brown (That’s so Raven) Aaron Carter (guest star on Lizzie Mcquire and also in a ton of specials) …… and those are just the ones I can name off the top of my head",belgeselsever,1bk89tq

"The Wall Between Brian Peck and Dan Schneider IMO one of the reasons why people try to compare Dan & Brian's offenses is because the documentary separated them in story telling, rather than intertwined in their history.  [  ## Two Pickles in a Pod  Early in their careers, both Dan & Brian worked on sex comedies, *Last American Virgin* and *Hot Resort*. Both films were written by the same person. Dan later worked with Brian's co-star and admitted to having a crush on her in a [2004 blog interview]( about *Better Off Dead*.  Their paths would cross in 1993 in ABC's *Home Free*, where Dan was part of the main cast and Brian was an extra. After working as a writer in *All That*, Dan [briefly left]( Nickelodeon to make his own show, *Guys Like Us* at UPN. Brian was also in an episode as Happy Pants the Clown. And in 2002, LA Times cited Dan & Brian running [comedy boot camps]( for kids while working for Nickelodeon.  ## Who hired Brian Peck?  Tollin/Robbins Production was not involved in Home Free & Guys Like Us where Dan and Brian Peck worked together.  In Dan's [youtube video]( he claimed it was Tollin/Robbins Productions who hired Brian Peck. In the Hollywood Reporter [exclusive]( it clarified Dan did not hire Peck on *All That*. Sources at Paramount said Brian Robbins (of Tollin/Robbins) was not involved in hiring Peck at Nickelodeon. This distinction is important because Brian Peck also appeared in Dan's first show as creator: *The Amanda Show*.  *The Amanda Show* ran between 1999-2002 and lasted 3 seasons. However it presented multiple problems each passing year. For one, splitting the salary of female writers Jenny Kilgen and Christy Straton where the issue was reported to the union. And in 2000, Jenny Kilgen sued the show's production company alleging [gender discrimination, harassment and hostile work environment]( Dan was said to behave inappropriately in the writer's room, asking female crew for massages and showing pornography from his computer. Raquel Lee left the series in the beginning of the 2nd season. In the Quiet on Set documentary, she talked about being neglected by the show when she raised her concerns about being disrespected & demeaned as a child actor. Then in [2001]( Brian Peck's abuse against Drake Bell began. And finally in 2002, Amanda Bynes, the star of the show would decide to leave Nickelodeon to start in a new show What I Like About You at Warner Brothers.  (Brian Peck appeared in 2 episodes of *What I like About You,* and Dan Schneider wrote one episode he appeared in: [S01E02](   Despite Amanda's parents firing her manager at Tollin/Robbins in [2003]( Tollin/Robbins continued producing her show *What I Like About You*. Based on Taran Killam's [Vulture interview]( he said he shared the same manager as Amanda. Goldman was hired by Tollin/Robbins in [1997]( then moved to Power Entertainment in [2004]( taking Dan Schneider along with him. And in 2010, People Magazine reported that Amanda was [spending a lot of time]( with Dan and his wife during the plans to emancipate her from her parents in 2003.  Also in 2003, two employees who both worked on The Amanda Show and All That were arrested for child sexual abuse.  Tollin/Robbins were still credited as executive producers on All That until 2005 but the collaboration between the network and the creator halted after. These series of events seemed to have severed the production company's relationship with Nickelodeon and also Dan Schneider.  ## ""Drake & Josh"" and the Letters of Support  After Brian Peck was arrested, *Drake & Josh* continued to be developed with now Schneider's Bakery producing. Here's where things become peculiar about Dan denying hiring Brian Peck.  Three people who wrote letters of support for Brian Peck, also worked on *Drake & Josh*:  * Beth Correll * Kimmy Robertson * Taran Killam  Both Kimmy and Beth would use their letters to testify against Drake:  * [Beth]( I must admit that I was surprised >!\~redacted\~!< behavior after hearing of this case and the charges brought against Brian. Nothing seemed to change in him at all. On set, he continued to be playful with other cast members and crew. He was always talking about his band and music and appeared to be excited about his future, the show and his musical career. He even moved into his own apartment. On more than one occasion, while watching her son perform on the set of >!\~redacted\~!< mother, Robin, would say to me, “Look at him. I’m so proud of how mature and responsible he is.” * [Kimmy]( I had the misfortune of working on >!\~redacted\~!<  TV show. I’ll make this short… I noticed this young man kept asking me about Brian and generally being “sleuth-like”. I also noticed no gay male ie: make-up/hair, or P.A. want to be alone in a room with him  Kimmy worked with Brian Peck since his first movie, *Last American Virgin*. While Beth worked with Brian on *Boy Meets World*.  Beth wrote 2 letters. The first was dated June 17, 2004. And the second one, containing the quote above was written October 5, 2004 - a mere two days before Brian was [sentenced](  [Taran]( did not have an extensive relationship with Brian compared to other letter writers. He wrote them when he was 22, before his career took off. According to [SNLinReview]( it was Dan who got Taran an agent while he was still at UCLA. In his case, he not only owes Brian, he also owes Dan. On top of also sharing the same manager as Dan.  Not only did Kimmy, Beth and Taran worked on a show created by Dan Schneider, they were also under his production company: Schneider's Bakery.  When asked whether Nickelodeon executives reached out, Drake said only Dan was there for him. And Dan said Drake's mom asked him for help to write her letter to the judge. Dan seemed to be a confidant for mother and son, but did he also know Brian Peck's friends and supporters were on set?  ## Child Actors in the Courtroom  The story doesn't end there.  In Quiet on Set episode 5, they played a clip of Will Friedle from the [Pod Meets World]( podcast stating:  >(Brian) then asked us to support him and go to court with him, which a lot of us did, and we're sitting that courtroom, on the wrong side of everything, of course having no idea of this, filled with child actors. To the point where the victim's mother turned to us and said, ""Look at all the famous people you brought with you ...""  In this [interview]( with the producers, they talked about the reason why not all letters of support were made public. They said:  >They didn't release the names of folks who were minor when they wrote. They redacted the names of minors who wrote the letters.  And in the [KCRW interview]( the host mentioned Nickelodeon stars.  We do know that Brian made friends with a lot of people. But Drake [also said]( this:  >... many people turned away and said no I won't write a letter ...  Through the course of investigating Dan Schneider's inappropriate behavior on set & sexualizing kids on screen, the documentary found out about the letters of support from sources who rejected supporting Brian Peck. They raised questions on what conditions the minors were put under, and if there were undue pressure or influence involved in making them support Brian Peck.  ## That's All  There was little to no coverage of Brian Peck throughout the years, up until the documentary [An Open Secret]( named him to have abused a Nickelodeon star in 2014. And the [Daily Mail]( put him back on the news in 2015. And in [2017]( Dan Schneider would post on [his instagram]( a signed poster of All That season 8, filled with messages of appreciation:  >Oh Dan - You can dip my pickle in dill juice any time! I owe you!!! xxoo Love always, Pickle Boy aka Brian Peck  For someone who is desperate to disassociate himself from Brian Peck, he had no problem reposting this for the public to see. Even more curious, is how Quiet on Set never used this information. And instead placed a separation between Brian Peck and Dan Schneider, as if they never interacted, as if they were never friends.",belgeselsever,1ca6q6b

"Dan Schneider knew what Brain was doing to Drake I’ve seen so many people say they think Dan knew what Brian was doing to Drake. I think people are forgetting that people are 3 dimensional.

Dan probably heard the news about Brian and thought about the fact that Brian was really close to Drake and decided to check in on him. Yes, is it weird that a grown man was hanging around with a teenage boy and no one really batted an eye? However this is Hollywood and normalized (while it shouldn’t be) and thats why no one thought much of it.

Drake has also said in a recent podcast that there were things he would film with Drake and Josh where he would try and change his lines or how a scene goes to make him feel more comfortable but do it in a way that doesn’t make it obvious. It would be more of a “it would be funnier if I said this or did this.” Makes you wonder what those instances were.",belgeselsever,1c4wuwp

I was really invested to see what Shane Lyons had to say, and he had one gross experience that he shared about Peck, but I thought there would have been more on that.   To be honest, they would’ve been better off making the episode the same style as the other episodes and just using all the cut content from the original interviews. From what I saw, there was a lot more interesting discussions from the cut portions of the original interviews that I would’ve liked to see more of.

I am from Oklahoma originally and I met Brian through an actor friend I was visiting one summer while still living in Oklahoma. Brian believed in my talent as an actor and encouraged my decision to move to Los Angeles and pursue this dream I had.  I have been consistently working in Hollywood for all the 14 years I’ve lived here. And I can easily say that Brian is one of the reasons why I have been as successful as I have been in this industry. Brian has a love and passion for this industry unlike I have ever seen. He is also very intelligent and knows the way this business works. I was lucky enough to have been graced with Brian’s guidance, uncommissioned guidance I might add, and support in pursuing an acting career. Brian has helped me work on audition material and has been almost an assistant to me since I began working and never once did I pay him for any of it. He does these things because he enjoys it and he likes helping people. No agenda. I owe alot to Brian for his time and energy in being a mentor to me through not only figuring out how to fit into this business but also how to be a better person in life. I don’t mean to dramatize this but I am speaking wholeheartedly about a man who’s heart is pure and no matter what you’re talking about, his intentions are always good. He has such an amazing capacity to care about people. This, I find, is very rare. Especially in Hollywood. Brian genuinely cares about other human beings.  While on jobs, he works with tremendous responsibility and professionalism. Brian is one of those people who if he says he will meet you at 9:00, he is there at 9:00, I don’t care if its work or lunch on Saturday. Brian is the one who scolded me when I tried to park in a handicap spot just to “run in real quick”. He MADE me move my car. I remember we actually got into an argument about it.  He is also one of the few people I would trust with anything. He has my utmost confidence. It was Brian who urged me to write thank you letters, who encouraged me to be thoughtful and give wrap gifts not only to cast members but the crew as well. Keep in mind, none of these suggestions from Brian were about “networking” or for my own self-gain within this career. They were simply about being kind, generous, thoughtful. Brian taught me how simple that could be and how rewarding as well. It was Brian who taught me why I should be interested in what is going on in the world. It angered him to no end when he found out that I had never voted before. Brian is a wonderful, loving, funny human being who has never, EVER, made me feel anything less than lucky to be in his company.  When I first heard the news of Brian’s arrest I couldn’t breathe. I could not believe what was happening. It was unimaginable. I’ve known Brian for 14 years and never once did I ever see any sign of him being capable of something like this. I have lived at his house for months and shared hotel rooms with him and never once did he ever make me feel compromised or uncomfortable in any way. I don’t know what it would take to have something like this occur, but whatever it is, it is extremely out of character for Brian.  I know Brian very well and I know how much he has suffered since August of 2003. Brian is a good person with a very healthy fear and respect for the law and, I assure you, what Brian has been through in the last year is the suffering of a hundred men. I don’t intend to victimize Brian, nor would he ever wish that, but I do feel compelled to shed light on the fact that he has learned his lesson. I guarantee you, the earth would fall from the sky before Brian would even think about doing something like this again.  I hope that you consider what I’ve stated here in your judgment. I owe to Brian Peck alot of who I am and who I am proud to be.  Sincerely,  James Marsden",belgeselsever,1boyqth
"Different perspectives: Drake & Josh Hey Guys, I’d love your thoughts on this…  So in light of the documentary I found Drake’s Podcast with his wife where they talk about Josh-the way he relates to drake, Josh’ reboot script etc.   And I think I glean a little bit of a sense that Josh didn’t have the best of times (due to his teenage insecurities back then) whilst Drake:   1. Found comfort in the series because he was literally living his dream (acting, wrote the theme song, his music was featured in S3-4)  2. His happiness was almost solely dependent on the series because everything else was turmoil (trial, trauma, family divorce/tensions etc) so he had a very heightened reference point of happiness and that’s the mis match.   So for Josh, Drake literally represents a time in his life that he’d rather forget. For Drake, Josh is the better part of his formative years and as a teenage guy-was never really (taught to be) attuned to what Josh was going thru and Josh most def couldn’t perceive whatever Drake might’ve been going through.",belgeselsever,1bnmldr

"The Pod Meets World episode just comes off as one big attempt to deflect blame. 90% of the podcast is literally the therapist, Will and Rider talking about how THEY are the victims/groomed and rarely touches about taking accountability about what they did. A small portion of the podcast talks about what Drake did and the monster that Peck was. How did they somehow turn this issue into about them about how they are victimized ? The classic mark of a narcissist is someone who makes others stories about themselves and turn themselves into a victim. This comes off as incredibly tone deaf and seems to be an indirect or just direct attempt to absolve them of responsibility by focusing on the fact that they were groomed.   In addition, they seem to harp on how this might make look Boy Meets World or Hollywood look bad ? Like it’s so bizarre to me that of all topics to discuss this is what they choose to focus on ?    I’m happy Rider apologized to Drake and got closure but dear lord these guys are not brave heros or anything. They’re two dudes just trying to cover their asses because they knew they were going to be exposed.  The therapist is a hack job btw if you do some research on them.   And lastly and most importantly, they were in their 20s when they wrote these letter. People have agency and can think for themselves, being manipulated is not an excuse nor explanation of why they wrote those letters. No amount of manipulation can convince a reasonable person to defend pedophilia (remember Peck admitted it to them that he did it). The reason they wrote those letters was because morally they thought it was ok and they were complicit with it.    And before preemptively say I’m not thinking with nuance, bullshit. I’m well aware of shades of grey, these guys aren’t as bad as mardsen or others but they’re not people that should be absolved of blame. They’re barely better than the others that don’t speak up, and we all know they’re doing this to control the narrative. Again, they were not only complicit but they supported pedophilia through their letters. The Dan Schneider and Peck stuff has been pretty well known since 2017 or so, well before this documentary. Not to mention they were approached by the documentarians and refused to speak on it but instead decided to make a whole podcast episode devoted to talking about it on their terms to shape the narrative.  Anyways sorry for my rant I know many will disagree but I do not understand all the defending people do of these guys on this sub. These guys did a shitty thing, approved of pedophilia (being manipulated doesn’t take away any accountability), and then preemptively released a podcast with a hack therapist in order to shape the narrative to deflect blame from what they did.",belgeselsever,1c5g0q1

"Drake and Josh I was happy, if not a little surprised, when Drake Bell talked about how Drake and Josh was an outlet for him, only because part of me is shocked he even wanted to continue acting after his ordeal. (Though it does make the current wedge driven between him and Josh even sadder in retrospect.)   Even still, I don’t know if I’ll ever watch scenes from the show the same way, considering the backdrop of him trying to pick up the pieces afterward. So dark and heartbreaking.  Growing up, it always seemed to me like he had your typical teenage moodiness (outside of his characters), but I’m realizing now that it was probably trauma talking. :(",belgeselsever,1bj3xkl
"Burn DEEP in hell Brian Peck🤬 My heart really aches for Leonardo DiCaprio and especially for Drake Bell, you don’t do that stuff or even say that stuff to or about a teenager. His fucking comments about Leo who at the time was a teenager made me literally throw up for a few minutes, and I hope one day everyone especially Drake gets justice and someone blows a certain someone’s brain’s way out.

"Fact-checking some of the Leonardo DiCaprio child actor rumors With the mention of Leonardo DiCaprio working with Brian Peck in episode 3 of *Quiet on Set*, I've seen a lot of folks discussing other docs/podcasts that have mentioned his connection other SOs while he was a child actor such as the Beyond the Blinds [episode]( ""The Childhood Bermuda Triangle"" and the documentary [An Open Secret]( Leo & his circle have more or less been my Roman Empire for a while, so here's a mini break down of things I've been able to debunk/found backing sources for:  **1. Leo worked with Brian Peck on Growing Pains**: obviously that one's true. See video footage from the doc. Leo has never commented on his experience working with Peck, positively or negatively.  **2. Leo and Tobey Maguire (his childhood best friend) were managed by other SO, Bob Villard**: some of this is true.  * Tobey Maguire was managed by Bob Villard when he first started acting around 12-14 years old. Bob wrote about Tobey in [this letter]( after a former client/friend of Tobey's, Christopher Pettiet passed away in 2000.    * *""I met Chris a good 10 years ago, when he was best friends with Tobey Maguire, to whom, in my bumbling fashion (and for sad lack of Tobey having a better offer) I was makeshift manager. Chris was hip and cool and rich at that time and the most flashy and successful of a young trio of actor/friends centered by Tobey and bookended on the other side by Leonardo DiCaprio...""*    * [Caption]( for a photo: *""Chris and Tobey went to Hawaii with me, and fought each other every day over who got to decide what do what and when!""*    * Other photo [caption]( *""Chris, Tobey and Leo as kids, about 14/15 years old, when Chris was ""The Big TV Star,"" Leo's greatest moment was the direct-to-video ""Critters IV,"" and Tobey wished anyone would hire him for anything.""* * Leo worked with Bob Villard for a lot of [photo shoots]( but I haven't found specifics on what role he played as a manager/agent/publicist/etc. * Neither of them have commented on their experiences working with Villard.  **3. Leo & Tobey worked for another SO, Marty Weiss**: this was brought up by the Beyond the Blinds podcast, and I haven't found any evidence they worked with him (and Marty Weiss is very active on social media and he's never mentioned them).  **4. Leo & Tobey lived at their manager's homes when they were child actors**: I haven't found sources indicating this outside of BTB (not saying they don't exist, I just haven't come across any). Leo described in interviews & speeches that his mom used to drive him to auditions before & after school almost daily, and he's talked about always being very close to his parents (BTB mentions this too, but they play it off as ""that's what all child actors say""). I swear I once read an interview where Tobey mentioned getting groceries from his neighbors & manager when he was young (his family struggled with money & homelessness growing up) but I can't track that down, and I definitely have not read anything mentioning him living with his manager.  **5. Leo was the breadwinner of his house because of his acting as a kid**: Leo's mentioned in interviews that being able to make money was part of the appeal to acting as a kid and he did grow up in lower-class neighborhoods. That being said, his parents had jobs and were not financially struggling, so it's not like they depended on his paychecks the way other families would.  **Smaller nit-picks**:  * The Beyond the Blinds podcast describes Leo being ""like 14 or 15"" when he was on Growing Pains. He was actually 16/17. To be fair, Leo looks very young as a teenager, but I mean you can Google his age and do the math. * Kinda irrelevant, but the BTB hosts misuse the term ""trauma-bonding."" To their credit, the way they used it (two people bonding after going through a traumatic situation together) is how it's commonly misused, but it's not its actual definition (a victim growing an attachment to the abuser)  **Tldr**: Some of the claims people are saying about Leo's experience as a child actor are true like him & his best friend Tobey working with some registered SOs as kids, but I haven't found supporting evidence for other claims like them living with these people and neither have commented about their experiences with them.  \*\*Edit for spelling",belgeselsever,1bmtesp
"HIMYM exposing Dan 13 years ago? So I will just say that I am at an age that I grew up with the Amanda Show and never actually watched that much of Victorious or iCarly, but I recently watched the documentary and some of the scenes that were shown in earnest as scenes from kids’ shows really brought to my mind Space Teens episode of How I met your mother that was aired around 2011-2012.  Do you guys know it ? Do you think it was intentional poke at Dan or just a general joke about tv show from Canada not translating to US market…?

"Im disgusted and heart broken ITs really devastating to think this wonderful part of our childhoods looking in from a particular lens was such a fun, joyous, safe, and even envious part of our lives. Meanwhile it was a horrific and damaging point in the lives of the kids on the other side of the screen. I feel absolutely horrible for these actors. I hope Drake Bell continues to mentally heal from this and is given great opportunities for his life. As well as Amanda Bynes. Someone protect her and help her please! her talent outweighs A LOT of actors that are thriving in todays society and she deserves better! She deserves help and idk who in the industry has already tried to help her and I get its her choice to refuse but shame on everyone! in the industry that could and doesn't! Shame on all those actors that wrote character references for a situation they had no fucking idea of. shame on any judge that could give such a slap on the wrist to a child RAPIST that fucking confessed! Im absolutely disgusted with the world right now. Why is this so fucking common??? WHY! oh maybe because child rapists dont have to serve life in prison for sticking their DICKS in children! so its must not be that big of a deal to continue the trend! great!

"I think one of the worst things that Dan did was shown in how he sexualized the underage characters on screen, but most tween/teen shows do that and I want to discuss how it’s a big problem Okay so I was actually watching a “what’s wrong with Girl Meets World” YouTube video by Tronn and it talked about how weird it was that they were justifying basically grooming between Maya and Josh (characters who were a middle schooler and a junior in high school). But what spiked my spider senses was when a short clip showed of Riley spraying her love interest with a hose, and after just watching quiet on set show Ariana being sprayed with water I was kinda on high alert. Now it is important to say the boy was fully clothed and not in a bikini like Ariana but it really got me thinking. One of the biggest issues with kids shows is how love interest are portrayed and how it lends to inherent sexualization of minors and puts the child actors in danger.   Since boy meets world is already discussed here I wanted to talk about the character of Shawn and Rider strong. Shawn was made to be attractive and it is shown in a lot of dialogue of him being a ladies man at the age of 12. Which is odd but whatever, the issue is that they have scenes of him shirtless or making out with Angela and it’s like “um okay”. And then the whole thing with rider being a minor making out with the actress who was almost 30 at the time. Then we can talk about topanga. The moment she developed she was really really sexualized and yes by the time they got married the actor was an adult but think about it from a writing perspective. You’ve been writing this girl since she was 11-12 and seen her grow, now the moment you turn 18 you are writing scenes begging for the character to show her butt, or her implied to be nude waiting to have sex???? Weird.   Let’s go back even further to saved by the bell. My sisters got really into it because the way thought both of the main boys were cute but it was difficult for me because that main girl was so clearly taken advantage of by the fact that the actress parents didn’t have an active role in her life. There is no reason that a poster of a little girl in a bikini should be on a show. It’s weird.   Disney also has its problems. Remember when London and Maddie made a “now strip” joke and they played an oooooohhh sound from the audience. Remember when they had Selena Gomez at 16 kissing a 27 year old on another Cinderella story. Or fast forward and young Ross lynch is shirtless for a lot of Austin and ally (and yes they were set in Miami on a beach but the other male characters who was not meant to be gawked at had his shirt on the entire time). Or even more recently with HSMTMTS, Olivia Rodrigo being a minor in a relationship with an adult (yes he was 19-20 but still) that translated into real life and negatively affected her (see driver’s license). I blame this all on the company.   As someone who was a child before and only watched shows for guys I think are cute, you don’t have to have slow motion shots or suggestive jokes to make kids tune in. You shouldn’t cast a kid for sex appeal. You shouldn’t talk about real children’s body parts. You shouldn’t have kids be partially nude, particularly for “fan service”. You shouldn’t have kids kissing adults for romance (HSMTMTS learned their lesson and didn’t have the next underaged girl kiss the lead until she was of age and people still loved the ship and it didn’t hinder the story much). Do better Hollywood",belgeselsever,1c6wktn
"Jamie Lynn Spears I think Quiet On Set is an important documentary for our times, arguably the most impactful to the children of the 90s. Every character, actor, and show I immediately knew. As we got older we saw  many of those actors in the news/social media/ movies/ fashion/scandal/ etc.   Is it just me, or did Jamie Lynn Spears drop off the face of the planet? The only time I have seen her in the media was when she was pregnant.  Other than that, I have only seen people speculating about her, and of course I Brittany has always been in the public eye.   Did Jamie choose to drop out of the public eye? Is she living a good life? Is she okay? Is she acting? Working on a business?   I just thought it was odd how little I have heard of her compared to the other actors and it made me curious.  (Or maybe I’m just oblivious)",belgeselsever,1bsv5mf
"Was it the times? Having your child spend the night with an adult? I'm 36. I have 3 daughters 15, 7, and 4. I would never ever ever ever ever ever let them spend the night at an adults home (adult had no kids). EVER !  But as I have been trying to process ""Quiet on the set"" all day, it blows my mind thinking and remembering how lax some of our parents were about sleep overs and trips with adults when we were kids. I mean,  even after being warned about Brian Peck and requested of his ex to not let Drake be alone with him, his mom still felt comfortable enough with the idea of Drake spending the night at Brian's home.  I understand these kids spent long hours with these adults throughout the day on the set but it still makes 0 sense that the parents would still put this much trust in to these people and  be okay with the idea of their kids going home with these people and going with them overnight.  We saw it repeatedly on ""Surviving R. Keply"" the parent so desperate for their children to attain fame they were just handing their kids over to him unsupervised.   I don't get it.   Then this line of thought made me start to dwell on my own childhood. Born in the late 80's, grew up in the 90's . I have memories of staying the night at my parents adult friends houses without my parents. And these friends had no kids. So it wasn't like a play date sleep over. I remember it usually always being my mom's single friends. I only get bits and pieces of one memory. I also was thrown off balance a few years ago when a ""image"" or I don't know if I can call it a memory, popped into my head of a young me on a bed at a male adult friend of my mom's home. I do not know, where this came from. I do not know if it's my brain playing a sick trick on me or my brain showing me a flashback of a memory. I don't let myself think on it. I chalk it up to an intrusive thought and hope it's totally fictional.  I'm feeling highly uncomfortable just typing this.  My point of this post is to discuss the possibility that this trend of kids spending the night with adults was something that was a regular and acceptable thing among these parents or not? Just the times, as they say. Was it? If so, why?!  I mean,  remember the documentary about the creepy neighbor that kidnapped his neighbors daughter. Prior to that her parents let him take her on trips. It's on Netflix. I forget the name of it but he was manipulating the parents and had separate intimate relationships with them .  Why were parents so trusting then? Why do you think they did that? Child actor/singer parents and regular parents. Why?   Our generation of parents would never ! Are you kidding me, like Benedict Cumberbatch could show up and ask if my girls could spend the night and I would be like, ""Bro you are one of my favorite Avengers and all but hell fucking NO! Get the hell out of my house! Start running my husband is headed down stairs with the gun! Your cape ain't gonna save you today!""  So my mind is blown and I feel like I just learned about awful things that happened to a friend and I'm like, "" Why didn't his mom protect him?!"" That's what processing this feels like, most of us grew up watching and adoring these kids. They were our age. So it's like learning our friends , the ones we watched on TV every week, we just found out horrible things happened to them and no one prevented it.   We didn't know these kids personally . But it felt like we did. Now we are learning all this and it's gut wrenchingly devastating. So I'm rambling trying to process.  And have so many ???????????",belgeselsever,1bktggr

These fans have also missed a huge point of this documentary - these children/ people were exploited and emotionally manipulated. I would say that fans are doing the same just to satisfy their own hunger, curiosity and sick obsessions with true crime.   These actors/actresses were forced to do things they don’t feel comfortable doing, and yet here are the fans asking Drake for more detail, or demanding other potential victims to come forward. What makes them think this is supportive behaviour and that any person would be comfortable with that?  Drake came forward because he was ready, but being ready to share his story doesn’t mean that anyone listening is entitled to anything more than what he chooses to share.   Imagine how hard it was for Drake to even reveal himself, and you guys want… MORE? Imagine how this is affecting the other victims? Fans are part of the problem. Really people.

"Children should not be actors until there is major reform. If we think about acting itself, it’s the art of becoming an identity outside of yourself in order to tell a story. Basically, actors are temporarily abandoning themselves and their reality.  It can work for adults most of the time because they’ve established their own sense of self that they can return to. They know who they are and that grounds them. However, some have still struggled to recover from particularly dark roles or from method acting for an extended period of time.  Kids cannot do this. Not with the way things happen in the industry today. Not without significant restrictions and safety measures.  Their brains are in a vulnerable state and they do not have a stable sense of self yet. This opens them up to so much psychological damage/trauma. What happens to them when they reach adulthood?  I think we’ve seen enough to know.  And what’s worse is children learn from what they’re exposed to. So whatever is happening on set and whatever they’re being told is what will be embedded in them. They never had a chance to know anything else. Abuse is normal right? Until they begin to know life outside of that world.  At the very least, extremely limit hours on set during filming. Allow extended periods away from these projects. Require parental supervision for everything. All table reads/meetings are recorded.  Absolutely no sexual innuendo or undertones. Even then… there’s still a risk.  And this goes for vloggers too.  It’s so crucial to let these kids be kids and keep them safe while they really need it. Those years can affect the rest of their life.  Thoughts?",belgeselsever,1bj82ho

I have been on a bunny trail now for hours and I came across this Reddit post from 8 years ago by a former child actor who was SA'd while filming a popular sitcom, along with other child actors on set. It is insane how much was going on in the early 2000s that went unreported. He states he used opiates to cope. Not sure if they're seeked help since it's been 8 years.

"I am so proud of those who have spoken out. I only wish they didn't have to. So over the past year, I've been hearing quiet rumbles about the child abuse in Hollywood, especially pertaining to Nickelodeon. I've even seen a couple YT videos about it. But like so many, I had absolutely no idea just how far it went. Of course child abuse in Hollywood has been a ""thing"" since it's earliest days, but you want to think and believe that these modern day children's networks are a safe places for kids. Unfortunately, they are anything but. I also knew nothing about what Drake has been through, both as a child, his struggles as an adult, or the charges lodged against him.  And though he was wrong to be texting with a minor (whether he knew or not), I commend him for owning up to it and putting an end to that relationship.  Because of the charges lodged against him, I do understand why people would have mixed feelings towards him. However, I am proud of him and all the other victims and witnesses who have come forward to speak out about the abuse they witnessed and endured. As a survivor myself, of rape, it's very hard to speak up, and the damage that abuse does to you, both in the short and long term, it can't even be described. We live in a culture that is designed to blame the victim so the abuser can go free, and it's such a shame that none of these children had anybody they felt they could safely turn to. Especially those like Amanda, Brandi and Drake, who's parent's were essentially forced out.  Although both Schneider and Peck were both behind some of the greatest kids shows of my generation, I'm glad neither of them work with Nickelodeon anymore. However the fact that Peck only got 16 months is maddening. The man deserves life in prison where he can no longer be a threat to other children.",belgeselsever,1bqcwyq

My weird talent was contorting my body in a way (kind of like a cobra position in yoga) and feeding myself a spoon that was held in between my big toe and second toe 🤦🏻‍♀️ honestly kind of hard to describe. Curious if anyone else remembers this or submitted a video too. This was literally recorded on cam corder and sent by mail. Obviously now wondering what happened to these videos… 🤢",belgeselsever,1bmckft
"Why is no one standing up for Amanda Bynes. Amanda has been in many of our childhoods and early adulthoods. It discusses what people are making it look like what she is saying. I think if any of us a blind items reader or a Sloan watcher on YouTube know about the RUMOR of Dan impregnating Amanda and forcing her to have an abortion when she was just 13, and that is purportedly the reason she cannot get or stay pregnant to this day.   It is sick and vile all of the tiktokers that are taking this blind item and PersanLA27 Twitter account as fact. Some have even said that Amanda has spoken about this. Amanda, in her own words, has said that she is not PersanLA27; this, of course, can be taken with a grain of salt as she was in the conservatorship.   Stop using Amanda as a tagline, clickbait, and a source to throw more vile shit at that disgusting man. Unless she speaks out of her mouth on video or makes a statement at a LIABLE outlet, stops bothering her, stops paparazziing her, and stops demanding she tells her story. She is very vulnerable and in a very dangerous mind frame right now. As a survivor if sexual assualt it is disgusting what people are putting in her mouth for clout.",belgeselsever,1bl9p2u

"If you choose any follow up interview to watch this is the one I seriously had not given Drake Bell a thought since D&J ended in the early 2000s. I've lived under a rock the last 15 years and had no idea about his legal troubles or anything pertaining to any Nickelodeon stars honestly. Kinda surprising considering I am heavy into true crime. Last year I did read Jeanette McCurdys book and when I saw a preview of Drake speak on QOS I decided to watch and wow.   I watched 5 days ago and since then I have fallen so far down the rabbit hole I can't figure out how to climb out. I have watched every YouTube video and listened to every podcast available that discussed QOS, Brian Peck and Drake Bells legal trouble. My mind feels totally scrambled. I'm not sure the point of this post except I did want to share the above video as I found it the most thorough/comprehensive and raw of the MANY I have watched.   I think what bothers me the most about Drakes story as a whole is the fact that he ended up being accused of crimes he had actually been the victim of. As a SA and abuse survivor I just cannot imagine being accused when you are the real victim. Not only that but the legal system, Hollywood, and  media largely swallowed the story of Brian Peck being a convicted child abuser. Meanwhile they extrapolated the comparatively minor charges Drake was facing into something so much worse.   I know this is a hot button topic but I DO believe there are people who lie about sexual assault. If there are people out there sodomizing children with forgein objects why is it so hard to fathom someone lying for revenge/attention? I've read/watched everything available pertaining to Drakes child endangerment charges and it seems pretty obvious most, if not all, of that girls story had no basis in reality. The New York times took that girls victim impact statement as the word of God and reported that Drake had been charged/convicted of sexual assaulting a minor and was now a registered sex offender. Neither of which happened.   So yeah, I'm just a nearly 30 year old stay at home mom sitting here screaming into the void. Join me if you would like, I could use the company.",belgeselsever,1bzczck

"Can we talk about this letter? This is the most messed up Brian Peck support letter in my oopinion. The actor who wrote it is less famous than some of the others in the headlines but JFC read this it's sickening.  Allow me to paraphrase- this letter writer saw a child with little to no support system find a parental figure in a man now *convicted* of being sexual *to any degree* with that child.   I don't care how ""misinformed"" you were about the details of the case.   You should find zero sexual anything okay within a PARENTAL-esque relationship. And then to use that to say, well see, it's okay that he had sexual relations with said kid because, you see, he was a FATHER figure to him and the kid had no real father around. Not just that it's okay, but it actually *excuses* his abuse of the child to such a degree that I'm now using this as reasoning to the judge as to why this guy should get a reduced sentence.

He said he didn't have a negative experience, nothing happened to him, he didn't hear about anything happening to anyone else and he can only speak to what he knows.

"I talked to my therapist about Drake. Today I had therapy since I am a SA victim & my therapist who specializes in it, I told her about my PTSD (I get flashbacks and nightmares plus anxiety etc) since I have been having reoccurring nightmares of my incident. I then told her that I watched this documentary with my mom & when Drake was talking about the incident & how his body language was full of anxiety, I cried during it.   She asked me how I felt about it and I said it felt like a happy cry? Like even tho it was sad but I could relate to him since I got molested when I was 13 turning 14 by an older guy and then my rape when I was 20, so it felt like I wasn’t alone especially when I was a teen. But I felt angry for how the justice system failed him because he was a minor, Brian Peck had 16 months but only did 4 months & then worked with Disney even tho he is a sex offender, then to read letters by celebrities who victim blamed a minor when he couldn’t even give consent, heck even “If Drake wanted to” it’s still statutory rape because he was a minor. Then seeing how his friends are like “Well my kids are ok” it’s like ??? So?? Maybe he did but your kids kept it quiet because they don’t want to get shamed or you might think you know a person but you don’t. I got raped by a guy I went to high school with, like you can’t trust anyone.  Plus my justice system failed me so I could relate a lot to Drake’s case a lot and it makes me sad and felt very empathetic towards him.",belgeselsever,1bq5nkk

"New Drake Bell interview Didn't see this new interview with Mayim Bialik here so I thought I'd post it. It's a really good one.  She was careful with her questions and quickly changed the subject when he started to get emotional. They even had a kind of support dog there, which was really sweet I thought.  An interesting thing he says is that being contacted by the documentary and just *knowing* it was going to come out (before he agreed to participate) was one of the things that he thinks contributed to his breakdown in 2023.  **The interview:**  [  Sorry I've no idea why the linked video starts at a certain time instead of at the beginning.  P.S. I had no idea the actress for Amy from The Big Bang Theory was an actual neuroscientist. Really cool.  **Edit**: a few other interesting points, regarding the documentary:  When asked about the producers' response when he called them and told them he had changed his mind and didn't want to be a part of it after all (after the first day of recording his interview), he seemed unwilling to say, seemed to me their response wasn't too great but he didn't want to speak badly about them, not sure what impression others got.  He doesn't seem to think the documentary was very fair in depicting life on set for children as so negative, when talking about how safe and protected he felt on the set of Drake and Josh.",belgeselsever,1i01wzd

"Devon Werkheiser’s podcast was so insensitive to the documentary & his weak ass apology is weightless. From Cine+ : “ DRAKE VS NED  Devon Werkheiser, Lindsey Shaw and Daniel Curtis Lee who starred in “The Ned Manual” for #Nickelodeon made some jokes on their podcast about the documentary “Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV” where they accuse the chain of hiding abuse from their young people actors for years.  The guys from The Manual of Ned on a Tik Tok live commented that none of that ever happened on their set and joked saying. ￼  ""Daniel, we told you to never talk about it."" Go back to your hole Daniel and give me your holes. Sorry, we shouldn't joke about this. ""We really shouldn't,"" Devon said while laughing.  This came to the ears of Drake Bell, who gave his testimony for the documentary. This one fired at them outraged and angry, saying:  “Ned Manual this is wild... laugh it up guys... Laugh it off... Give me your hole?!!

He was never involved in the scripted shows where the problems occurred and he even said he never met Dan Schneider and Double Dare ended before Schneider arrived so he had nothing to say on him. This goes back to people saying if someone who worked on Nick never experienced anything negative or in this case weren't even there when the bad stuff was happening why do they need to speak out?

"Finally saw An Open Secret and one of the commentary was how Brian Peck immediately admitted guilt and whether he or the studio didn't want the investigation to continue It mentioned Nickelodeon by name and referenced a famous child actor. It also showed a court document where the crime occurred in 2001.   Same person said how it was the child's choice to remain anonymous to continue working - which is an unfair take. Especially when the co-founder of a SAG committee (who opposed doing a PSA on a similar case) said it was to ""protect"" the child's identity and how it can stigmatize their career. Doesn't really sound like a choice but an ultimatum that is beneficial for a studio that doesn't want to have a reputation for employing pedophiles.   An Open Secret also involved a similar case that had a recorded confession and conviction. And like Brian Peck, only served a couple months in prison and went back working in Hollywood after. Unfortunately this part of the story was overshadowed by the Marc Collins Rector (DEN) and Bryan Singer news.   It's like a PR mindfuck given how Singer had a minor role in the documentary but took up all the headlines, essentially veering the focus away on proven cases of CSA in Hollywood (Marty Weiss, Brian Peck, Bob Villard). Especially with what happened to his accuser afterwards who got sentenced with a crime.    Makes me wonder what will happen to the reputation of Quiet on Set in the long run.",belgeselsever,1brhljl

"The most important story in this series was forced into a side story Drake's experience and even Katrina's with Jason Handy were more significant than the general abuse from Schneider(at least as far as what was presented in the documentary and with evidence).  Yet those actual horrific crimes against children took the backseat. The agenda of this entire docuseries was specifically aimed at Dan Schneider, and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with them having a specific target. However I do find one aspect of it borderline upsetting.   Drake very clearly has a positive view of Dan Schneider and looks back on how Dan was the most caring/supportive person he had on set. Which, causes me to really question the relatively small spotlight they gave to the WORST instance of abuse at nickelodeon.. did they cut much of that focus because it actually made Schneider look a little better and more human?   And do not misunderstand me here; I am NOT trying to say ""well Dan doesn't seem so bad after all!"". That's not what I'm getting at here. He's still an extremely demented and abusive person just based on the actual evidence we have, and that doesn't even take into consideration the speculation about Amanda Bynes being impregnated by him at 13. If that ever gets confirmed, it's obviously at the very least on par with what happened to Drake. I'd say it'd be worse considering an abortion was possibly involved as well.   My only point is: did Drake's(and Katrina's) abuse get overshadowed by *relatively* much tamer abuse, due to this documentary being aimed solely on Dan Schneider? Because ultimately, Schneider's issues THAT HAD EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THE DOCUMENTARY, was simply inappropriate back massage requests, manipulative/cruel behavior, and sexual innuendo involving children. All absolutely terrible things. Absolute nightmare boss. But still isn't on the same level as the aggravated s3xual assault that Drake sustained.",belgeselsever,1bl2jqo

5th episode seems very mediocre I was so excited for this episode but it really was disappointing.  I felt like the interview didn’t ask a lot of questions I was hoping she would ask especially when talking to drake about Amanda bynes. The lil music video added in the episode was kinda weird and I hope this doesn’t come off the wrong way but I didnt care for Bryan and his mom’s interview on this episode. I feel like they are really trying to push the race theme and there probably was times when they faced racism on the show but with the info they shared it just feels like a reach.  When him and his mom watched an interview clip of a cast member from the Amanda show they said it was racist. I don’t think spitting in someone’s face is racist it is disrespectful for sure.  But on the segment they’re referring to Amanda would spit in everyone’s faces when she talked. It looked cheap and just a quick money grab.  Like why wouldn’t they keep it the same?

"Support letters for Brian Peck from Beth and Rich Correll. Beth Correll wrote TWO letters of support - one dated June and the other dated October.

Apologies if these have already been posted, and also for the crappy quality - I could only find tiny versions of them and had to zoom in.   I feel like these letters are almost more damning than any of the others - perhaps not in their audacity regarding victim blaming Drake as some of the others were (Kimmy Robertson wins on that front) but Beth Carrell worked with Drake regularly for four years after the abuse took place. HOW was this allowed to happen after she supported Brian so openly? And also why did she write two letters?

He said, ""Oh I jump-started the careers of Kenan and Kel."" So they talked about us being overlooked and then he overlooked us in his answer.   ___  **On whether they talked to Dan recently**  Samuels: I got a phone call. He reached out a week before the documentary aired. He asked if I could give a quote of support. .... He knew I was in a documentary for a year. And he was like, ""Oh, I love Gio. She's great, she's nice, great.  She could tell my side."" And I don't know what you want. I don't know what possessed him.   ___  **On Dan saying there were layers of approval to his skits**  * Lyons: When you have a cult of personality in any work environment, inevitably it's ripe for toxicity. We get into their sphere and their orbit, and no one wants to disrupt what's happening, above or below.   * O'Brien: Dan said he had many, many layers above him. He had a boss and his boss had a boss.  * Lyons: Well, it sounds like the farmer that blames the tractor for the poor harves, it's like ""Not me, man."" You shirk responsibility, it's pretty simple. When you're not at a point in your life to take ownership of the mistakes you made, the first thing to do is to shift the blame to someone else. I think the lessons that hopefully the perpetrators highlighted in this film can learn, is that ultimately what needs to happen is them learning and everyone else learning too. If they can't do that, then there's no chance of them actually growing or changing or evolving.",belgeselsever,1byp8ne

"Why was Brian Peck not charged with multiple counts of rape? It strikes me that although Peck was charged with 11 crimes, he was not charged with rape. Based on what we can glean from the scant detail publicly available and what Bell said in the doc, it would seem that Peck could have been charged with multiple counts of rape. Instead it seems that he was charged with a bevy of lesser offenses and then was able to plead to only 2 of those.  I wonder if it would have been the same if Peck had abused a 14 year old girl instead of a boy. I also wonder if the victim-blaming we see in some of the support letters (one suggests that Bell was so promiscuous that men avoided being alone with him) played any part in that.",belgeselsever,1bqgsrw

"Anybody else think it was odd Drake’s abuse case against himself was brushed over quickly? I’m not sure if any of you have read the victim testimony from Drake’s 2021 trial where he pled guilty to a felony charge of attempted child endangerment & a misdemeanor charge of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles but it was pretty harsh in my opinion. The grooming was claimed to have started at 12 until the sexual abuse started at 15 but because there was no evidence of the physical crimes he was only prosecuted for the text messages proving all of this. Anyways, I just found it rather interesting that this case was kind of brushed over very quickly with his statement that he took responsibility for his actions & what he did. It is absolutely horrendous what Drake went through with his own abuser, I am not downplaying that in any manner but I just would think for someone who went through that, you wouldn’t want to put someone else through it. Yes I completely understand that the cycle continues itself but I more so feel like the documentary portrayed that event as a slap on the wrist when it was MUCH more than that.

"Something I haven't seen acknowledged on here The era of live-action sitcoms on cable starring kids has quietly died down.  No, I'm not saying Disney Channel and Nickelodeon have completely stopped making sitcoms with kids, but they're producing fewer sitcoms than ever before. This is reflected in their schedules; today, the only sitcoms airing on Disney Channel are reruns of a show that ended years ago, and the only sitcoms on Nickelodeon are part of Nick at Nite. That's a big change from how things were 10 or 15 years ago.  One can't credit the docuseries for this recent development. Fact is, the ratings for the kid cable channels are horrid these days because children have stopped watching cable. They would rather watch Netflix, or play video games, or spend time on YouTube or TikTok or Instagram. As a result, both Disney and Nickelodeon are being more careful about how they spend money. (Nick, of course, continues to rely on SpongeBob, and Disney is banking on animation with international appeal like Bluey.) It seems sitcoms aren't as good an investment as they once were.  I suppose this is a good thing, although a part of me is bummed to see how insignificant these networks from my childhood have become. There was a time when I thought my children would grow up watching them. Now, I'm not sure these channels will still be around in another ten years.",belgeselsever,1c1n9tv

"Amanda Bynes and Mean Girls Alright so I want to know if anyone else remembers this rumor/story that began going around when Amanda Bynes was beginning to push to move beyond her sketch comedy projects with Nickelodeon (All That and The Amanda Show) that her camp made a big campaign to have her cast for a project that seemed completely perfect for her. That the two extremely talented female writers/actors from SNL, Tina Fey and Amy Pohler were making this movie about and aimed at teenage girls.. that since Amanda Bynes had spent the last several years as the wunderkind of Nickelodeon’s sketch comedy, she should be a total shoo-in for any of the roles.   Ultimately, the comedy written for Mean Girls was very much not the style of comedy that Amanda Bynes had been doing.. it wasn’t prat falls, silly/goofy faces and reactions, or very physical at all. It was dead pan comedy, sarcasm and teenagers being hilarious without intending to be hilarious. And that they passed on casting her..and that it fractured her relationship professionally with Dan Schneider for basically telling her she was as good as anyone on SNL for years, but being seemingly snubbed by the SNL cast and writers when they make a project specifically in her age/gender as “not what they’re really looking for” and Dan Schneider and co. not being able to push her through regardless.   And honestly looking back, it’s true she *wasn’t* right for Mean Girls and it was such a juggernaut of a hit. I can only imagine how she felt that Disney’s golden girl Lindsay Lohan was cast and that Nickelodeon aka Dan Schneider didn’t do enough to get their long standing and popular star into legitimate film opportunities that would be huge hits after she’d just done Big Fat Liar and What A Girl Wants.

"Sugar and coffee I’ve been watching clips of all that and the Amanda show and I’m really questioning some of the skits. Sugar and coffee was a skit mentioned in the doc so I watched some of them and it doesn’t sit right with me. Aside from how the sugar would end up looking by the end of the skits (which Kyle mentioned) it’s an extremely exausting skit to perform as they’re both running around, screaming and jumping which they would have to film MULTIPLE TIMES for different angles/bloopers but I’m mostly questioning how it was ok to have young children drinking large amounts of coffee and eating pure sugar which would likely make them extremely hyper then exhausted . That’s not healthy at all for even some adults to be doing multiple times and must break some child labour laws. It’s also so unsafe for it to be pouring gallons of sugar and liquid at them which gio says they would sometimes CHOKE ON!  I just don’t understand how this was ok to film and how no higher ups or parents questioned it  The sugar and coffee was real by the way Lisa confirmed it.",belgeselsever,1c4yiy2

"Dan Schneider’s Creepy Self- Inserts Dan Schneider had a disturbing number of (sometimes literal) self-inserts in his shows.  Usually in the form of a dark-haired funny fat guy.  Himself in the jacuzzi on The Amanda Show  Himself and some other creeps on a poster in a girls locker in Victorious with the caption “So Hot.”  Josh on Amanda Show/Drake and Josh. One of the first episodes is one of Drake’s girlfriends secretly flirting with him. Though the interesting conflict and Josh Peck’s great comic timing makes it less obvious, the direction on Susan acting overtly seductive is pretty suspicious.     Mark on Zoey 101, this lame guy Quinn obsesses over for some reason and has no chemistry with and dresses overtly sexual to win back.     This schmuck on iCarly giving Sam a foot rub. Someone posted the pic in another thread.  This may not be exact but Penelope stalking Amanda could be a form of this.  Chase pining after Zoey seems like a bit of a stretch considering how it’s a real teen experience/feeling, but it’s possible as well.  There’s definitely some incel mentality in him.

"Double-entendre in children's shows I think there are two issues to consider:  1. Using double-entendre in kids shows so that adults having to sit through it are also entertained is a long-standing tradition. And of course it's in the nature of comedy writers to think up such things as inside jokes. These go back to Punch & Judy & other puppet shows, old Hanna Barbara & Merry Melodies film cartoons originally shown in theaters and modern cartoons like super friends. It becomes different when you're using kids as the medium for such jokes but the full awareness of that was not understood at the time. 2. In the 1990s people were just not as cognizant of many of these themes that came out of the minds of Hollywood writers. Pornography may have been universal (once it hit videotape) but not nearly as ubiquitous as today. So even if the parent saw it and it reminded them of what it could be they didn't immediately conclude it was intentional. Today people are much more sensitive to such parallels and if they happen there's no question but to see that it was intentional.",belgeselsever,1c8tquu
"Nickelodeon Accountability I’ve been thinking a lot about this since watching the doc. We all know Dan Schneider is at fault for creating an environment that harmed the people and children around him. It is even rumored he SA’d some himself.   But here’s the thing they don’t outright say in the documentary - *Nickelodeon* as a network, themselves, didn’t care about the pedophiles that worked there, or Dan Schneider’s work environment, or his writing that constantly sexualized the children on these shows…. Because they were getting amazing ratings. That is why nobody intervened. Because everyone was making money, because of god damn *ratings*   And the ratings were so much better than anything else for two reasons.  1. It was a kids network and there weren’t a ton of options for kids to watch at this time   2. Pedophiles tuned in to watch and Dan created a whole new audience for kids shows   Nickelodeon NEEDS to be held accountable and I hope they get sued for their inaction and utter despicable handling of these heinous pedophiles.

"Why I think the docuseries is presented the way it is, and my take on it as a whole. I'm going to preface this by saying this is my opinion and all speculation. Also sorry in advance for the extremely long post.   My husband and I watched this the night it came out, and my hubby was like ""why is this about Dan, while also being not about Dan?"" And It made me think and I was like I think it's because Drake is the only one willing to fully speak about his experience with Brain who had the ability to do what he did under Dan. The other point I made was that drake possibly didn't have a bad experience with dan(as he had nothing really negative to say about him) because Dan could be a pedo, but there is a very real chance he could only have pedo feelings for girls. Drake knows he has no right or evidence/proof to say for these other victims, that Dan was ""in fact"" a pedo, so he only expressed his story which is the correct choice to make. You can't go after Dan without SOLID evidence, and also he made it hard for them to do so when he traumatized them and they broke publicly for the whole world to see- they then became less credible amongst society, I mean look at how many people to this day still believe drake bell actively set out and slept with a girl he knowingly knew was underage? Vs what we now know is the truth. Idk obviously just my opinion but I really think this is why they went about it the way they did. To just at least try to blemish Dan's name a bit more to help for when the others are ready to speak out.  Also- A few things we could learn from the Nickelodeon documentary:  1.) We need to protect both our daughters AND our sons, and teach them of the dangers of the world. 2.) Mainstream media is not to be trusted, they warp the story and from what it looks like recently, try to make potential victims look crazed, unstable, or worse. They ruin their reputation and credibility. Please do your part to stop the misinformation that has no factual proof. Don't just share everything you see, research it, find evidence and then you can present the information. But until then please stop, especially with Amanda bynes. 3.) Seriously, keep an eye on what your children are exposed to. A lot of the weird scenes discussed in the show were scenes that as a child I even thought was weird, like wow these adults really think we think feet are that funny? I don't blame parents for not knowing then, but there's zero excuses now to be ignorant about what your kids are watching.  4.) Give these child stars a bit of grace, stop yelling at them, and stop assuming every person is a victim and needs to speak up. It's really gross how people are treating these celebrities, and yelling at them to come forward, or even worse telling them how terrible of people they are for not sharing their stories and that it's their fault people got/are getting hurt. That's a disgusting take. It's the abusers fault not theirs. Give them some freaking peace and a safe space so that if they do have a story they could feel like they will actually be heard.   Lastly, be kind, take all information with a grain of salt, trust your gut, and put in the extra work to keep your child safe as the bad people of the world are working just as hard to hurt someone.

Would a better time to have done it be when they worked together on Spider-Man? Absolutely. Should he never do it out of fear that sheeple will accuse him of trying to redeem himself? Absolutely fucking not. It’s better late than never.   Should they have not addressed it at all on their podcast given there were lots of listener questions about it?

"Do Some of the Drake and Josh Episodes Feel Weird to Watch Now?? Okay, really disheartening to learn the traumatic events that occurred to Drake Bell when he was only fifteen years old. I think the time frame was that Brian was harassing drake on the set of the Amanda show, and towards the end of the show is when the physical abuse took place. Drake had to endure the torture for six months before finally speaking out to his mother and authorities about what had been going on. Brian had been arrested right before the production of Drake and Josh. I think it was only a year later, so after the first season, is when Drake was attending the court. Dan was fully aware of the fact that Drake had been SA'd, as Drake said he had told him when he was asked about it.  So, I was looking back on some of the episodes from Drake and Josh, and there are some that give me an icky feeling for Drake and what he was told to do in the show, even with Dan knowing what happened to him.  &#x200B;  **Season 2, Episode 5: Pool Shark**  This is the episode in where Josh is surprisingly good at pool, and Drake uses it to his advantage to hustle people for money using Josh. When Josh finds out, he decides to teach Drake a lesson by playing pool at some biker club place and trash talking all the older guys, where eventually two men, who are Josh's camp counselors, play them in pool in order to scare Drake into admitting hustling was wrong. I thought this was weird because the whole time Josh played, the two large men stood on either side of Drake tauntingly. Not only that, but when Josh won, the two men pin Drake and Josh against a wall, one of which had a hand essentially on Drake's throat. Looking back on that episode now, I just get a weird feeling about it. Some of that filming had to of triggered Drake a little.  &#x200B;  **Season 2, Episode 10: The Fan**  Luckily, this episode is no longer available on streaming services. There are a few episodes that you are unable to watch, and when I looked it up it said it had something to do with ""vague licensing issues"". This is the episode where one of Megan's friends, Wendy, develops a crazy parasocial relationship with Drake and claims to be his number one fan. She ends up stalking him, getting jealous of him on a date, creates posters and shirts with a photo of him asleep that she sneakily took, starts rumors that him and Drake are dating, and even calls him ""baby"". This is incredibly weird considering how Brian Peck calculated all of the interactions with Drake, and even developed an interest in old film to gain his attention. And he was often stalking Drake around the set of the Amanda Bynes show and being very touchy with Drake, even helping him put clothes on. Now, while I think the obsession this very young girl develops with Drake is weird, I think one of the things that weirded me out the most was that Wendy climbs up the window the Drake's room and gifts him a jar of pickles. What's weird about it is that when Brian Peck was on the Amanda show, his character he was most known for was 'Pickle Boy', a man who always had a large tray of pickles and gave them out to people. When this happened on Drake and Josh, it was more of a thing where it's like, ""oooouh,"" maybe in terrible taste.  &#x200B;  **Season 2, Episode 14: Honor Council**  In this episode, Drake is falsely accused of putting Mrs. Haifer's car in her classroom. He is suspended unless he can prove his innocence. Drake and Josh appeal the case in something called, Honor Council, which is essentially just a high school version of a court room. The entire time majority of the people there, Judge included, do not believe Drake and are against him for most of the trial until Megan finds evidence to prove it was Mindy. Now, keep in mind that this was in Season 2 which was aired in 2004. Brian Peck was charged in 2003 and plead no contest to two of those charges in 2004. Which means the filming of this season was around the time Drake was attending court. I know this might not of been something Dan knew, but I think it is a little odd to have Drake essentially be in a court again, especially with everyone against him saying he is lying. Maybe a showcase of poor timing, but I don't think that was the best thing for Drake at the time.  &#x200B;  **Season 4, Episode 1: Josh Runs Into Oprah**  Basically with this episode Drake forgets Josh's birthday and upsets him. Drake tries to make it up to him by getting him tickets and backstage passes to see Oprah. When Drake tells Josh about the tickets, Josh gets overly excited and actually kisses Drake on the lips. This one was probably the most disturbing of it all. Some people had said that Josh kissed Drake on improv, and it was actually supposed to just be a hug. Which, in turn would make it worse if the kiss was something Drake was not even expecting. But I find that hard to believe because when Josh kisses Drake, Megan snaps a photo of it on her camera, which leads me to believe the kiss was written in the script, because why would Megan have a camera ready to photograph them just hugging? Dan is really weird with having them kiss. But with Drake wanting to keep his situation a secret, I can see him not speaking up about his discomfort on it and confuse his co-stars. But even with that aside, they're supposed to be step brothers in the show, why would they ever need to kiss? Super weird to watch back.  &#x200B;  **Season 4, Episode 14: Steered Straight**  This is the episode in which Drake and Josh are repeatedly getting in trouble, and their parents are tired of it and want something to change with them. The two officers that bring Drake and Josh home offer to put them in a Steered Straight program, which is just a rip off of Beyond Scared Straight. With this, the boys will be arrested and processed to scare them into not wanting to disobey again. However, this plan turns for the worse when the cop who is escorting them to the station, responds to a robbery call, and the criminal steals the car with Drake and Josh in it. To avoid trouble, Drake and Josh convince the criminal that they are also dangerous criminals, and gets the criminal to take them back to their house to rob it. When the two get in their room, they try to call for help, but are finding trouble to dial when they're both still handcuffed. Ultimately, Drake takes the phone in his hands behind his back towards his butt and bends over so that Josh can lean down and use his nose to dial the numbers. This one might be a reach, but I feel like it's just an odd situation or position to put them in. I can see this being something uncomfortable to act out.  &#x200B;  Some of these connections may seem like reaches, but these are just the few that I picked up on while rewatching that I thought would be weird to have Drake act out knowing what he was going through around this time. I know that a brand new episode of Quiet one Set is releasing soon, and that Drake Bell makes a return in it. I wonder what more there is that Drake is going to talk about. And I really wonder if he would share if there were any moments while filming Drake and Josh that he felt uncomfortable.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;",belgeselsever,1bs1vqh

Or can they get out of them? Do you think we’ll hear from more people? I wish everyone who had a “crazy” phase or had to hide the effects of the darkness they endured could be vindicated and explain what happened to them (if they wanted too yknow).

"I Feel Guilty, For me seeing Drake bells father cry at the thought of what his son went through made me feel nauseous, and somehow guilty, im not sure how to feel after watching it, I fucking hate Dan and Brian and the fact Brian got only 16 months is WILD and the fact DNA's harassment kinda went untouched he just got kicked out after what over a decade of abusing his power. I feel so guilty for enjoying these shows when Drake said he doesn't even remember filming Drake and Josh a show that had such a profound impact on my childhood, all of that I feel so guilty knowing Drake went through so much abuse and trauma and that other little girl, who emailed her that perverted video and the man took a boy to the Nick parking lot. not even to mention the drug abuse and drinking that kids **LITERAL CHILDREN** were exposed to alcohol and emotional abuse on ICarly, in Jeanette's book.   knowing these kids' biggest issue was if they were going to have to get drunk to keep their jobs or get sexually abused beyond belief when in reality their biggest worry should been, what's the script today? or what homework do I have? makes me feel so filled with guilt and grief for even enjoying and shows.

"Why is everyone so focused on Brian, but no one is talking about Jason as much? I definitely feel Brian’s getting the attention he deserves as he is a free man in one of the 3 houses he owns on that block (in the court documents if you look there’s 3 addresses all on the same block, coincidentally it looks like one on opposite corners, almost like a look out? then the middle house which looks like it’s the front but you really get to it from the entrance and on Google maps it sort of looks like a compound.  And they’re the only gated like heavily gated properties on the block)   Anyways I feel Jason was the POi until we all were shocked like Virgil end of episode 2 then the very traumatic final episodes that follows.   Which i feel has taken our focus on Jason as well, not even gonna get started on Brandi’s mother and also why does she speak on Brandi like past tense?  Jasons in West Virginia in his nice house a few blocks away from his mother’s house which is where he probably hiding now.   I can’t imagine seeing that video he sent Brandi and sweep it under the rug.  Like… what.. you didn’t.  Call. The.  Police. To keep her’ in acting.  Like whoaaaaaaa. Yeah. No.  He woulda went to jail or hell that night. Lbvs.    The end of episode 2 did make me forget about Jason for a while too but I watched it again with my gf and then I researched Jason’s file and his diary and OMMMMFGGGG..   As a man and a father to a 9 YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL… who has a nephew that looks like Drake.   I don’t get how these men are alive let alone free.   I don’t condone violence or hate or anything at all.  But I don’t care where I’m at if if I see one of them including Dan, someone going to sleep if not worse and I won’t even be able to control it.

I also understand it’s not that black and white, and if my child was an actor that is a complicated world to navigate.

"Boy Meets World Podcast's Attempts at Damage Control When you read the [letters]( that Rider Strong & Will Friedle wrote in 2004, they didn't mention the victim and focused more on making character statements about Brian Peck as their friend. Other letter writers were far more abhorrent at victim blaming. Had Rider and Will just issued an apology admitting fault, it could have leveled the backlash against supporting a convicted pedophile. Instead they put out a podcast ahead of the documentary, where they ended up saying worse things.  ___  **Timeline Reference:**  2003  * August 19 : Brian Peck was arrested * August 20 : LAPD [report]( announcing Brian's arrest  2004  * June 20 : Date on Will's letter    * Rider Strong (December 11, 1979) would be 24 years old and Will Friedle (August 11, 1976) would be 27 years old * October 7 : Brian Peck was sentenced   2024  * February 5 : The Quiet on Set trailer drops * February 19 : Pod Meets World talks about Rider & Will's involvement with Brian Peck    * Episode  2/19/24 on [Spotify]( and [Apple]( Podcasts * March 17 : Quiet on Set Documentary airs * April 6 : Drake Bell said he talked with Rider Strong privately and has forgiven him  ___  ## Podcast Ads and the Press  The podcast played ads, and most of them were iHeart & true crime podcasts. One of which was Variety Confidential. ""A true crime podcast that dives into Variety's historic archives to explore stories of sex, money and murder in the entertainment industry.""  The podcast was prefaced with this disclaimer:  >We saw no signs of this behavior and we're not victims ourselves.  The podcast hosts warned their listeners that Variety might participate in clickbait journalism. Here's some of the headlines:  * [Variety]( Rider Strong and Will Friedle Detail Alleged Manipulation and Grooming by ‘Boy Meets World’ Guest Star Brian Peck * [USA Today:]( Will Friedle, Rider Strong allege grooming by 'Boy Meets World' guest star Brian Peck * [Deadline]( ‘Boy Meets World’ Alums Talk Grooming, Manipulation & Brian Peck’s Child Sex Abuse Case * [People]( Boy Meets World Actors Detail Past Friendship with Guest Star and Convicted Child Abuser * [Entertainment Weekly]( Boy Meets World stars discuss former friendship with convicted child abuser costar: 'It's awful'  The language was fairly neutral and even implied Rider and Will as victims of Brian Peck. Variety didn't label Brian as a pedophile, but a guest star. People and EW labeled Brian a child abuser, instead of a child rapist. And being friends with a child abuser doesn't necessarily imply they supported and defended him. Lastly, none of the titles mentioned writing letters of support to a convicted pedophile to reduce his sentence.  Compare this to the Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher coverage:  * [Variety:]( Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis Wrote Letters in Support of Danny Masterson Ahead of Rape Conviction; Kutcher Called Him a ‘Role Model’ * [Deadline]( Danny Masterson Sentencing: Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Giovanni Ribisi & Others Praise “Good Friend”, Ask Judge For No Prison Time For Convicted Rapist * [People:]( Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis Among 'That '70s Show' Stars Who Wrote Letters in Support of Danny Masterson Before Sentencing  Variety Confidential and Pod Meets World are both iHeart Productions. A Variety ad played during the podcast. Variety gave the the Boy Meets World cast a positive headline. And yet they told their listeners it was Variety who would be casting them in a negative light.   Not only did Rider and Will got paid for this episode, they also received positive press and admiration from other people. They did not get any type of backlash like Mila and Ashton did.  ## Guest Therapist  The episode featured Kati Morton facilitating a therapy session as Rider and Will process their friendship with Brian Peck.   Kati was the therapist in Shane Dawson's videos about [Jake Paul's]( ""sociopathy"" and Eugenia Cooney's eating disorder. Kati has been accused of being [unethical]( . And in a 2018 [Buzzfeed]( article admitted she was unfamiliar with antisocial personality disorder.  >""He came to me and said, 'Hey, I want you to read and learn as much about sociopathy and antisocial personality disorder.' I don’t know much about it, so I started reading research articles,"" she recalled, adding that she found the condition ""fascinating.""  This is how the Pod Meets World introduced Kati:  >... we have reached out to an expert family therapist, Katie Morton. Katie has been on the forefront of the mental health movement since twenty eleven, demystifying mental health myths and replacing stigmas with understanding ...  ## Conspiracy  For the most part, Will & Rider reflected on how they were fooled by Brian Peck's charm and what they were thinking by writing those letters. However near the end, the podcast dropped this line:  >This is like a classic thing that's you know, the satanic panic of the eighties. You have like the Repressed Memories movement, Pizzagate, like right, Florida book bannings, like right now, it's like there's like it's a moral panic with pedophilia that is such and you know, there's a reason for it.  These were loaded buzzwords that's associated with discrediting victims. Dumping these terms within the context of admitting fault for defending Brian Peck was suggesting a completely different signal to their listeners.  Drake's case was reported to the police, went under investigation, acquired evidence of Brian Peck **admitting to sexually assaulting a minor**, got convicted and had to register as a sex offender. And journalists have copies of the 41 letters of support for a convicted pedophile.   So why did they bring up the [Recovered Memory Movement](  Child sexual abuse happens within families, in schools, at church, in workplaces - including the entertainment industry. It is also severely under reported. By raising concerns about a a moral panic, they tried to prime their audience to disbelieve an incoming documentary about child actors being abused on set.  They also painted Hollywood as a potential victim of false accusations:  >I feel like I oftentimes like Hollywood gets pushed back, and I think pedophilia becomes an easy way to sort of like target Hollywood and like, you know, say like, oh see, it's a **den of iniquity.**  They also said when it comes to pedophilia it's something everyone can rally  around but murder can sometimes be justified. But in 2004, they did justify Brian Peck's offense as being a victim of jailbait and that's why they supported him.  They were also worried about tarnishing bad people's reputations:  >Why are we talking about it, why are we bringing it up now? ... I watch a lot of people behave horribly during Boy Meets World. Like I watched grown ups do awful things. I'm not tarnishing their reputation.  The ironic thing here is not naming names would be fine if they were holding predators accountable behind the scenes. But what happened in this case was they conspired to support the abuser instead of the victim. They secretly planned an act that harmed a victim, by using their celebrity to persuade a judge to give a reduced sentence to a pedophile. And they kept this a secret for almost 20 years.  ## Public Relations  The podcast was made for PR reasons and they admitted to it:  * ""it will rise to the top of like one of the most talked about facts about us and our show, and like, okay, so what's wrong with that?"" * ""I don't like the idea that like we are you know, affecting the cultural memory of Boy Meets World with this, because that's a bummer""  They cared more about their reputation and the public's perception of Hollywood without thinking about how the victim would feel. This podcast was not an ""apology"" nor taking ""accountability"". It was an hour of trying to forgive themselves before they sought the victim's forgiveness. This is Rider Strong and Will Friedle putting themselves first as victims before Drake Bell publicly came out as Brian Peck's victim.  They kept repeating they were manipulated but they were the ones manipulating their audience. They didn't talk about Peck as an authority figure that they relied on growing up. They admitted they have more power over him. Brian was just an extra while Will & Rider were the stars of Boy Meets World. They also said Brian was just this funny, cool guy, that's fun to hang around with and had famous friends. He offered them a role and feel indebted to it. That is not manipulation. That is a transaction.  ## Reactions  A comment under Alexa's [instagram]( page said:  >Alexa, Rider Strong was also a minor at the time this was going on and when he wrote that letter and he worked with Peck *as a minor* as well. He’s spoken out multiple times about his personal experiences with being groomed in Hollywood as well. Surely you can admit there may be a certain level of nuance here?  Drake [replied](  >No he wasn't. RIDER WAS 24 years old when he wrote the letter and was told by Brian what he did. He wrote the letter anyway.  (  And also [replied](  >Will was 27 years old and Brian told him what he did many people turned away and said no I won't write a letter but they did. Will was not manipulated. Brian admitted it to him and he wrote the letter anyway. Then he worked with me on many many episodes of spider man years later and never said a word to me about it. This is because they were told there (sic) letters are going to be made public. Everyone thought the letters would be sealed forever and no one would ever see them. This is their publicist telling them how to get ahead of the story.  In the Sarah Fraser interview, it talked about the perception on how Hollywood protects predators. Drake mentioned how others link the word conspiracy but he has 41 letters of support for a pedophile to prove it. Clearly referencing the Pod Meets World podcast. And in another, he tried to extend an olive branch that despite him working with Will after the incident, they weren't really in an environment to talk about the letter. And that he can't continue being at odds with them.  Eventually leading to this [tweet]( of publicly forgiving Rider Strong:  >I just had the most amazing conversation with (a)RiderStrong we are all healing together. I have nothing but love and forgiveness for him.  It's a step in the right direction for both sides to heal. But it's also important not to forget how things unfolded. The Pod Meets World podcast was a bad attempt at damage control and only worked before the documentary aired. And in trying to absolve their guilt, they hurt the victim more than it helped.",belgeselsever,1c4jsqd

"Brian Peck ‘Remorse’ Drake said in the doc that BP would express remorse for his actions after the fact and say that ‘he would never do it again’ and ‘he didn’t know what got into him’. I’m not excusing anything of course, just trying to understand this behavior. When the abuse got as bad as it did, how could Brian continue to express remorse after the fact and maintain that it wouldn’t continue? I find it hard to believe that he would say that after it was obvious that it was very much intentional and would very clearly continue. I imagine that there was a point where he would stop pretending that his actions were going to stop, no? Was he somehow genuinely unaware that it would continue? I don’t think so. What does that line look like, for such a manipulative person?  EDIT: Also, can anyone explain the psychology behind the confession over the phone? I don’t understand that.",belgeselsever,1c3ly1o
"The President of Nickelodeon from 1996-2006, the bulk of when these events occurred, was Herb Scannell Why hasn’t anyone reached out to him for answers on everything that happened under his watch?",belgeselsever,1c329t8
"Did anyone else think this series was going to be something significantly different? I haven’t see episode 5 yet, but everyone’s saying it’s basically a useless, repetitive addition anyways. The end of E4 it felt like they were shaping up a conclusive end to it all, and I suppose 5 was added on because of demand.   I have no idea if this was the point, but I’m left with TONS more questions than answers, and this isn’t a fictional work where that kind of paradigm can be dramatically satisfying. I thought this was going to be a greatly extended insight into the nuances of questioning how this happened, who allowed it, and what can be changed going forwards. We don’t need the graphic details (like we got with the court documents of Drake’s repeated assaults) if they don’t want to share it, but there needed to be a greater breadth and deeper examination of the circumstances of all these stories and the cause and effect of them all.  This is still a piece of “filmmaking” in a sense, there needed to be a tighter complexity in shaping perspective on the subject matter from the makers in how they’re gathering information (how they phrase questions/scenarios and then draw out answers from their subjects) and how they’re assembling it for the final edit. And the interviewers sound completely disengaged when we do hear them (suggesting that the creators didn’t pick up on it, and thus don’t care), further giving the impression that their image of this whole endeavor was for shock value and there was no genuine unifying vision/goal encasing this project.   The series implies a lot without giving us a sense that these disturbing incidents have any psychological through-line or foundation conveyed more cohesively, expressed directly or not, within the series itself. It often feels as if the makers feel a complicity in both bringing these Nickelodeon workers back, greatly underutilizing, not just the telling of experiences themselves, but even more in finding fresher angles they might feel comfortable exploring in more sound, astute ways (are they aware of their limits or lack of genuine concern?), but also a complicity in being part of a mass cultural machine that offers no probing layers of possibilities, no connective/honed insights, and more concerned with illusion of social progress while more unconcerned that they’re perpetuating the turning of rusty wheels that everyone can hear.   There’s a lot of issues I have with our general, contemporary social modes, but I’m glad that people aren’t giving these creators the idea they’re anywhere near as well-oiled as they likely want us to believe.   Also, do we know how many older Nick workers they reached out to? Why did we only get to see what felt like only ten people? I get that if someone was seriously abused they might want privacy, but surely there are TONS more people who were on those sets who remain untraumatized to this day who could offer up plenty of detailed insight into what they saw. Are people just terrified of burning bridges, getting threats, losing work? Even the people who were basically strong armed (likely) into making some kind of statement after being associated with Nick seem like they’re themselves enormously conflicted, while maybe not grasping it’s still possible to unequivocally be on the right side of morality completely. This whole series feels like a shadow that everyone wants pushed back into the closet.   Then we have Josh Peck’s weird video addressing Drake, the Ned’s Declassified idiots making wildly inappropriate jokes, next to no one reaching out to Drake, seriously considering how this greatly scarred him and what they can do for him now, etc. I’m sure there’s tons more examples. This is why the abuse and its after effects will continue because of tremendous, evasive fear, a lack of unifying understanding, and the refusal to not continually feed gratitude into the social structures that shaped you up to believe you would have no self worthy of acknowledging without them.  I guess my own hope that a mass produced product like this series about real, horrifying tragedy could actually subvert my expectations and illuminate eloquently a subject matter that’s anything but. It seems like they did to so many viewers what the machinations and the enablers of it have done to use regarding the abuse for years now: they’ve pulled a fast one.",belgeselsever,1c0pvlf
"Ned's Declassified Podcast Response Hi everyone.  I'm wondering what the general consensus is on the podcast episode ""Ned's Declassified Cast Addresses Quiet On Set."" Devon, Lindsey, and Daniel addressed their TikTok livestream where they were making very very distasteful ""jokes"" about the victims, Drake, and what happened.   If you haven't seen the clip, [here]( it is along with Drake's response on X.  Personally, it didn't feel like a genuine apology to me and felt as if it was more of an attempt to save face. They essentially blamed their ""jokes"" on the fact that they did that livestream before watching the docuseries. Regardless, they have known about Dan Schneider's wrongdoings for awhile now and should never ever have made those comments to begin with. That's just me though - let me know what y'all are thinking.",belgeselsever,1bnqadg
Gacy/peck So I have lots of thoughts that are bothering me with the peck/gacy connection and I’ve been poking around places to see others thoughts.

Anyone else think this was not just a random coincidence?,belgeselsever,1bmrrcl
"My Take Finishing ""Quiet on Set"" has left me with a nauseous pit in my stomach,  especially after hearing Drake Bell story, and the fact people didn’t even know it was him, and he had to keep that in for a very long time is heartbreaking, especially when seeing his father's heartbreaking attempt to protect his son. It's agonizing to think about how he stood by, unable to intervene, The fact that Drake's mother seemingly chose not to intervene is fucking beyond me. His warning to Drake’s mom goes unlistened to somehow. The scene where he expresses relief that it wasn't Drake who suffered is utterly gut-wrenching. The weight of his sorrow and the visible change in him afterward weigh heavily on my mind.  Say what you will about Drake, but witnessing any human endure such trauma at such a young age is deeply distressing. This was his passion, his dream, and to see it blemished by such darkness is truly disheartening. No one should have to achieve their dreams of wanting to be on TV at the cost of their childhood and everlasting impact that Brian will just have on him.",belgeselsever,1bmcx7g

"The disclaimer: “Nickelodeon investigates all FORMAL complaints.” …Do they ONLY investigate formal complaints? There were so many red flags both on set and on air.  1. It was blatant. Higher-ups should’ve recognized it and acted.  2. All sorts of workplace ethics violations (long hours, pay discrimination, wrongful termination, etc). They fostered an environment where people had to be silent.  3. NO ONE was checking in on the kids (except the pedos). Why was there no occupational therapist or anyone checking in on them?   4. When something did happen, an exec and/or Dan Schneider might pop in to say “Did anything happen to you?”…and that’s it.

Baby reindeer Somewhat related to the doc…. Has anyone seen baby reindeer on Netflix? Warning- it can be super triggering. But oh my goodness it is so accurate for depicting cptsd after SA and grooming - it is quite heavy though. I can’t help but to compare to Drake’s story and it’s sickening :( as a victim myself it was super hard to watch and I didn’t know it was going there. But also weirdly comforting to know you aren’t alone especially in the response to the actual trauma. I think that is where most of my shame comes from tbh.,belgeselsever,1c6wna0
"The Double edged sword: “But he was abusive too” Disclaimer: I have no evidence he abused anyone nor do i intend to diminish or deny someone’s reality/experience as such please interact with this post with care as there are no winners when we are crass.   This feels like a double edged sword, because after learning about what Drake’s been through I was flooded with empathy, sorrow and sheer hope for his healing and recovery. As with truth telling though, his own muddled past of abusive behavior to at least 1 ex has come to the fore (I’m not adding the child endangerment stuff because the law already sorted that out).    I can only imagine witnessing the population find empathy for someone who’s darkness you may have come face to face with and equally in those moments feared for your life. Yes we understand what may** have driven his alleged behavior as we now have context. Mind you we are fully aligned that Brian Peck idolized John Wayne Gacy and so can only hypothetically imagine the real horrors he’s inflicted on Drake, the mind games et al. So while we empathize with him can we equally empathize with her(s)?   Abuse is cyclical and hurt people hurt people; in the same breath we have only in the past decade especially after the me 2 movement began to take sexual assault and mental health seriously, become tenable to therapy, meditation and other forms of somatic/trauma release methods.   We also know that you don’t really *get over * certain extreme traumas you grow around it. Additionally, it changes you-the trajectory of who you are, would’ve become without it, and how you interact with the world, what you perceive as your world. Let’s be cautious in our words and extend grace to all** parties except nasty Brian Peck and his liege of supporters-they can burn below hell.   You know I can’t leave out my Josh take..   Josh: In light of all his buffoonery and unsavory ways, unfortunately he reserves a lot of room to not align with Drake over the years. I also think from start, Josh just viewed him as a coworker on similar paths. He wants to get to a certain prestige and if the “Drake and Josh” team propelled that agenda-he was for the most part game, meanwhile Drake was leaning into a personal brotherhood r/ship-he kinda wanted to get there with Josh. It’s like that coworker you go through rough times with only to learn they never really considered you close. But much of Josh’s likeness came from Drake & Josh and Drake is mostly 	accessible on a personal level-not as a co-worker and THAT is his conundrum.",belgeselsever,1c39iz8
"Did Drake actually live with Brian for a period of time, or was it just these weird “sleepovers” now and again? And how in the name of GOD was that even allowed to happen? Sorry I seem to have missed this part of the documentary, was he still living at home with his mom? Why/ how did he end up at Brian’s house? I’m from the U.K. so I don’t understand American law/ child safety/ social services, but when I was a kid (I’m the same age as Drake) if I’d suddenly started sleeping over at a 40+ year old man when I was 14/15 you can bet your ass social services would be right on it. How on earth did this not alert suspicion? Obviously his parents are insane for letting it happen, but what about everyone else who knew him? Drake had a lot of friends, why did their parents not question this? Why didn’t senior crew and cast on TAS question it? The whole situation is absolutely mad to me because it feels like he was failed by quite literally every single person in his life.   Can anyone shed any light on how this was allowed to happen? Is this just what it’s like in Hollywood? A literal child can just sleep over at the house of a random guy and every single caregiver and responsible adult just goes “this is fine”?",belgeselsever,1bq1cp3
"Deep Admiration and Relating To Those Who Spoke Up I admire the filmmakers for making sure people were comfortable and safe while they spoke. And not just talking to famous people, but a crew members and lesser known actors.  I admire everyone who agreed to speak out. Those crew members and actors who risked their jobs. The famous actors using their platforms for change, taking responsibility and making better choices. And everyone who’s bullying and pressuring Hollywood for change and accountability.  I wasn’t a child actor or SA’d but I did face decades of emotional abuse and those who enabled them.  I admire Jeannette McCurdy for being one of the earlier people to speak up and continue to do so. But ALSO, you can tell she did a lot of work on herself over the years and came to more of a peaceful place. She’s also a great writer and genuinely very funny.  I admire Drake Bell for shining a light on severe abuse that men and boys can face, and giving us increased awareness that men need actual protection and support too.  Alexa Nikolas is the one I relate to the most particularly because her bullying experience with a miserable status-obsessed mean girl and an angry, narcissistic man-in-charge is most similar to mine. I remember staying angry and rehashing my problems for years, refusing to see shades of gray in other people who had very different experience and more nuance in their choices, but ultimately targeting my anger in the right place trying to make a better system.  I get why she feels the way she does but think she needs more therapy and has quite a ways to go in her healing but she was also one of the first people to speak out about Dan Schneider and Nickelodeon before the public wanted to hear it and faced backlash for it.  This documentary is helping me look differently at my own experiences and mental health journey.",belgeselsever,1bokjg1
"Amidst all the spotlight on Dan Schneider, - FEDs raid Diddy's Homes in Miami & LA - Curiouser & Curiouser.. You mean to tell me that the $30M payout to keep him out of court with Cassie wouldn't keep him outta court? /s    They run in such small circles, and one ( seemingly ) and one has nothing to do with the other, but I did find it interesting that:   Amanda Bynes dated Kid Cudi >  Kid Cudi dated Cassie >  Cassie warned KC that Diddy was going to plant a car bomb > KC's car exploded. - Amanda Bynes was arrested after having set a small fire to someone's driveway.    [Ugh! Could you imagine being a young Usher or Justin B and living with this guy?](  Do I think that Amanda tried to do something to someone's car? No, Im sure Diddy has his own goons for stuff like that. The correlation that I am making here is that these circles are small and still the effects run far and near. I think at some point, Amanda could have heard of something like that happening and then processing the trauma while in a bout of psychosis. In varying degrees, everyone plays their part when it comes organized crime circles.

"Anyone else feeling like this/curious?! I have scrolled through most, not all, of this sub so please forgive me if I missed this question/discussion!   Like most, I've binged the docuseries and am so horrified that I cannot stop thinking about it.   I remembered a lot of the scenes that were used as examples, it brought back some blurry and not so blurry memories of others mostly from All That and The Amanda Show. I very vividly recall watching as a kid and thinking that some of the scenes were gross or weird and I was off-put/uncomfy watching them but I couldn't really understand why. Welp, it all makes sense now and makes me feel a bit (a lot) icky.   Having read a lot of similar takes here and on other platforms I'm sure a ton of people, myself included, went to watch episodes of these shows as an adult to compare/see how they feel/if they recall more, whatever reason. I even saw a few posts about people's 'watch next' suggestions including Nickelodeon shows mentioned in the series, so I imagine there is a pretty decent uptick in views.   Then I started to wonder- Do any of these absolute nightmare people from the network make money off of all the streaming of these shows? Will the actors? I'm sure every show and every contract is different, obviously I'm not well versed in royalties and all of that and would be interested to see how that works in these cases!",belgeselsever,1bl5l57

"Just something to consider Lately, I’m seeing a lot of dissatisfaction with this docuseries, for various reasons. And I’m also seeing a lot of people wondering, “How could those jokes/content be allowed on a kids channel back then?”  There’s an assumption that an answer to that question is held by the people above Dan Schneider—the executives that actually ran the network all those years. If any of them were invited to be interviewed for the docuseries, they all declined.  But I wouldn’t assume that getting those execs to talk would result in much. First of all, I think most of them would just pass the blame along to someone else. And second, I think most of them would respond with, “Why are we taking these old show so seriously?”  Which brings up something that I don’t think has been acknowledged enough: This docuseries is about kids TV, a genre that has never been taken seriously. Critics avoid having to write about kid shows (YouTubers have picked up the slack) and virtually everyone working in that field is trying to get out of it. (The docuseries implies Schneider himself tried leaving the kids TV realm a few times before giving up.)  Why weren’t more adults outraged by “Victorious” in the early 2010s? Because most parents weren’t watching alongside their kids (my parents didn’t watch with me) and anyone who was writing seriously about TV was focused on “Mad Men” or “Breaking Bad.” “Victorious,” and all the others, are currently facing a sort of scrutiny that they didn’t face when they were new.  As far as the networks are concerned, kid shows are meant to be outgrown, which means they are disposable (long-running shows are rare on the kid cable networks—there’s only one “SpongeBob”). Because of that, kid shows are produced quickly and cheaply. And yes, perhaps carelessly. This stuff isn’t considered art—It’s a product that needs to get on TV before the young audience that has embraced it moves on to something else.  To be clear, none of this is an excuse for transgressions both onscreen and offscreen. But it’s something to keep in mind. Did people really not care back then? No, not as much. Most people were just grateful to have the TV serve as a babysitter.  Anyway, I’m sure there are plenty of responsible adults carefully monitoring the influencers that today’s kids are watching…",belgeselsever,1c0smq2

"Telegraph lyrics In the podcast interview with Roberto Mtz, Drake says, ""The way that I communicate is through songs and writing music and lyrics"" (minute 36). When asked about the autobiographical elements of his songs Drake says, ""I recorded Telegraph in the midst of all of this actually happening, and so 37:17-37:30). Here he is interrupted by a question about the album date. He continues, ""I think if you go back and dissect some of the, a lot of the lyrics, they'll kind of hit a little differently with all of this being out now, knowing what I was going through. I was living it so I knew, I knew what I was writing about. I think that fans listening to the record are going to see it differently now"" that they'll be able to ""see what he's talking about here now. I think on Telegraph there's a lot of that"" (37:41-38:36).  I would love to hear everyone's interpretations of these songs now that we know some of what inspired them.

"Drake Bell's story... Back when Buzzfeed released their article on John Kricfalusi and how he groomed two girls--one of them into being his live-in girlfriend for a number of years--I remember thinking that no post-MeToo story could haunt me more. Because I was *obsessed* with *Ren & Stimpy* for some time, even corresponding with the creator on MySpace (it was never anything creepy, possibly because my PFP wasn't of myself; according to blameitonjorge, John didn't write back to Robyn's letters until she sent a picture of herself).  Then, I get to ep. 3, and that same haunting feeling comes right back. I'd known for the past 6 years that Brian Peck was a registered sex offender (thanks to Shane Dawson, of all people!) but never any inkling that it could've been Drake Bell.  According to Robyn's now-deactivated Twitter account, she explained how John was able to isolate her from her busy parents, invite her over to his house where he eventually molested her at 16. In blameitonjorge's video, she brought up how John was friends with other pedophiles, who supported and normalized the relationship, calling her ""John's little girlfriend.""🤢 That story was what ran through my mind as Drake and his dad recounted theirs.  She also mentioned how Spumco was a run-down studio with a room where a computer was apparently used for porn, based on the leftover semen. Reminded me of what was also said in the doc.  What's more: for some reason, Investigation Discovery (or DirecTV) numbered episodes 3 and 4 the wrong way. So, we ended up watching the most shocking ep. as the last one!",belgeselsever,1bn10ae

"Why did this receive so much publicity Multiple documentaries have been put out addressing pedophilia and Hollywood, and almost all of them, without fail, have been blacklisted from the Internet. Clearly, this is something that “Hollywood” would like to keep under wraps, and they’ve taken great measures to do so.  Some examples of this are Corey Feldman‘s documentary, which, according to him, he doesn’t even have access to anymore due to being hacked. “An open secret” would probably be the most famous documentary addressing pedophilia in Hollywood, and even that received such little publicity despite being made by an Oscar nominated Director. In fact, I was following the aftermath of some of the individuals that spoke out in the documentary, and while nearly none of the accused rapists faced any criminal charges, most of the alleged victims got very little screen time in any production afterwards and one of them is now behind bars (really has me wondering why there isn’t more media coverage on this, I don’t think I’ve seen one article that highlights the strangeness of that situation).   So my question is, clearly there are great lengths being taken to prevent these accusations from receiving any public attention - how do you think that this documentary was able to achieve the success and media attention that it has received thus far? Obviously, I acknowledge that “Quiet on set” wasn’t exactly a documentary that focused on pedophilia in Hollywood as much as Nickelodeon’s very questionable history, but I’m still surprised that it’s received such public attention. Is it just that they have a big name associated with it?  Also, feel free to correct me if I have any information wrong. I did my best to check myself on most of this, but if the situation is taught me anything, it’s that you shouldn’t trust everything you read online",belgeselsever,1brodl6
"The Game was rigged all along Honestly just getting some stuff off my chest here…  1. The children never stood a chance. Growing up we thought money and wealth came with fame but instead they are given fame, little to no wealth, no true autonomy or rights and so it keeps them susceptible to abuse.   2. Many people are comfortable with child abuse -as seen with the people who wrote letters of supports.  The thought of this is so crippling and jarring because you’d think of all things the one thing you could depend on is for someone to find that as sickening as you do but alas-SO MANY PERSONS are comfortable watching, aiding, supporting, enabling, promoting Child Abuse.   3. You can’t save those people who are pedophiles or the persons who support them either. It’s damn near a cultural norm to accept???? Child abuse.  4. We raise awareness but what’s next? Are we truly ready to give survivors the space to discuss it as many times as is necessary? Are we going to strike/make these companies feel the wrath of our disgust?   5. With all that evidence and a full blown confession Brian Peck (his name is repulsive) was sentenced to 16 months and served 4 in prison and whilst registered on the sex offenders list, went on to work at Disney, do we now understand how complicit so many persons are?  6. Imagine the victims having a tumultuous and unstable life because of the lack of support and the PERPETRATORS move on without a stitch?   7. If Drake ever see’s this, my love thank you for your bravery, your rawness, your honesty, your authenticity, your openness, your transparency, your accountability (for things like DUI) but it really was never your fault - all symptoms of a horrid disease. And even if you need another 25 years to speak about it-we understand :’).   8. Drake’s Dad- I thank him for his bravery, his willingness to speak up then and now-true character through and through. In today’s world you wonder how many of those persons are left, he’s a brave reminder to stay the course of integrity.   9. There are far more people groomed to choose money/wealth over fame, and many more that are just evil and THIS is one of the side effects of capitalism.   10. Nothing will change until we begin to treat people like people and restore their humanity, nothing changes until we learn to love and respect ourselves. Integrity is even more necessary than ever.   11. @Corey Feldman-I was too young to understand at the time, but I’m ever so grateful that you found and continue to find the strength.",belgeselsever,1bohhnd

And Brian Peck is currently free!   I don’t know why this is controversial but I know to some it is: personally I think repeat sexual offenders, especially when the victims are children, should be given the same sentence to a murderer. Especially when they are let out and reoffend multiple times! Why is Jason Handy getting out at all?

"Dan Schneider vs Drake Bell [  For the past few days, I noticed an indirect defense of Dan Schneider by pushing forward the narrative that the verbal abuse and sexual harassment he was accused of was not as bad as other abusive behaviors outlined in the documentary. Technically he did come off looking better in comparison to two convicted pedophiles. But in between the hierarchy of those wrongs, also included Drake Bell's own abusive behavior.  Through out these discussions, I couldn't quite identify why I'm sensing a rivalry between Dan and Drake when neither of them spoke ill of each other. That is until I heard this line from [Quinton Reviews]( video (01:28:16):  >""Dan Schneider will never work in television again. I think this is for the best. Dan Schneider needs to go back to working in television like Drake Bell needs to go back to touring high schools around the country with his band""  Most of the comments around the cycle of abuse referenced Brian Peck's abuse of Drake, and not often compared to Dan's alleged abusive behavior.  In his recent video, Quinton argued that the documentary couldn't criticize Drake because they owe him. And that it wouldn't be ""finished"" without him. He pondered further that the documentarians were exhibiting the same bias like those who don't have a problem with Dan privately.  Quinton referenced [Kate Taylor]( Business Insider article at the end of his video. And yet her reporting stood on its own without Drake's involvement. Some research likely used for the documentary goes as far back as 6 years, since Rick Ellis started investigating Dan in 2018 too. There were also enough cast and crew members who participated in this documentary like Bryan Hearne and his mom, Kyle Sullivan, Katrina Johnson, Giovonnie Samuels, Alexa Nikolas and other sources to create a tighter story.  I'd even counter-argue that while Drake Bell is the more recognizable figure for marketing purposes, he also serves as a liability to the entire thing. Putting him front and center not only makes him a prime target of the criticisms, he can also be used to discredit or downplay issues surrounding Dan Schneider and Nickelodeon.  Making him relevant and popular again also meant his child endangerment conviction and other abuse allegations would reach a wider audience than it was first reported. Drake coming out with his story was a double edged sword, with the risks outweighing its benefits.  ## PR Campaigns  Quiet on Set placed a spotlight on Nickelodeon's former child actors and actresses being harmed in tv productions. And Dan Schneider parting ways with Nickelodeon since 2018, allowed the studio to distance itself from the scandal. The speculation that the documentary was made as PR for Drake seems like a case of projection from the major network and powerful Hollywood figure, whose reputations required more fixing.  Quinton [tweeted](  >I do kind of regret mentioning the Drake Bell stuff, the public opinion on that trial massively shifted between when I recorded that material & when I posted it. But the main thing is that we're obviously in the middle of a massive PR campaign and it's frustrating to deal with.  It could be frustrating when popular beliefs suddenly gets challenged. In 2021, Drake had no real defense. The sentencing video included numerous and severe allegations against him and he didn't personally contest any of it.  In court, Drake was called ""a danger to children"" and The New York Times even reported he ""[will have to register as a sex offender.]( Two statements that makes the messaging clear: this is a predator and a pedophile. Two years later, the NYTimes would make a retraction:  >A correction was made on March 18, 2024: An earlier version of this article misstate the punishment that Drake Bell was given in a child endangerment case. He was given probation and community service, but was not required to register as a sex offender.  The same article linked back to an [interview with Dan Schneider]( that was published two weeks prior (June 30, 2021). It contained a cover picture of Dan smiling, sitting on a tree, an incredible sign of hard hitting journalism. It's also the same article Quinton used as a source for his video.  The interview addressed alleged misconducts and gave Dan the last word on each one. A similar approach can be seen in his [apology video]( posted from his own YouTube channel. It was labeled as an [exclusive]( by The Hollywood Reporter but instead of a reporter, he answered questions from an iCarly actor.  The interview included a rebuttal that seemed to mirror Drake's legal troubles at that time:  >As for interacting with fans online, he said that he did so “only in very public ways” that were fully transparent to his colleagues. Among the teenage actors on his shows, he added, texting was often the preferred mode of communication.   >   >“I never interacted with actors in any way, texting or otherwise, that should make anyone uncomfortable,” he said.  Rick Ellis criticized the piece as ""[whitewashing]( of Dan's past behavior:  >The article spends a fair amount of time reminding readers of Schneider's genius and the underlying thread from the comments and Schneider's remarks is that it would be a shame if he wasn't able to continue to share his magical creative touch  The NYTimes article also reported that Dan was looking forward for a new show to be greenlit, aside from developing other projects and a pilot intended for kids and families. So in the midst of Drake's arrest and sentencing was a less than flowery profile of Dan Schneider's attempts of going back to television and settling some rumors surrounding his ousting from Nickelodeon.  Some are throwing a wrench at the documentary by framing it as Drake's rebranding / redemption arc when it was Dan who was inching for a come back since the 2021 NYTimes piece.  ## Dan as the Fall Guy  Quinton used the quote below to frame Dan as a ""semi-retired guy being blamed for everything"" (01:41:08)  >Dan Schneider is singlehandedly responsible for everything that went wrong in Amanda Byne's life  Quinton argued that instead of placing all the blame on Dan, we should focus on ""the cultural system that consistently trades in the mental health of children for millions of dollars."" The (not so) funny thing about this is that Dan himself claimed the jokes and sexualization as ""innocent"" that kids found funny and ""approved"" by the network -  absolving himself of any power and influence he had in the process. Dan was and still is part of that system.  Later he argued that fans use Dan as the fall guy for all the things fans hate but not the ones fans love like Helen and Spencer's characters. Accidentally stripping Yvette Nicole Brown and Jerry Trainor's efforts in bringing those characters to life. Nickelodeon isn't exactly known for writer-driven shows ala Succession. Dan also already got a ridiculous amount of credit from a lifetime achievement award to a New York Times piece comparing him to the [Norman Lear of children's television.](  Dan became the face of the scandal because he did market his own brand in his own shows, as seen in Quintons own video (00:28:45). Dan inserted his social media username ""danwarp"" and promoted himself using Nickelodeon shows to amass an online following, giving him direct access to fans. Contrasting his claims from the NYTimes article that ""it was never his goal as a showrunner to be popular or recognized."" There's also this [thread]( that cited old articles where he allegedly told a reporter: ""I'm Daniel Schneider, I think you've heard of me.""  In another article, he said he was ashamed that one his first acting gigs was a ""teen exploitation film."" Ten plus years later, he created shows serving sexual innuendos sly enough to pass S&P censors and sexualized teenage actresses to an audience of unassuming children. The idea that his legacy is something he was once ashamed of is some kind of karmic justice.  ## The Case Against Drake Bell  Quinton also [tweeted](  >Very annoying to deal with thousands of people inundating you with the information that Drake Bell didn't purposefully sext a 15-year-old, he claims to have *accidentally* sexted a 12-year-old. So it's fine  and he wasn't culpable for his actions!  A similar type of argument was also included in his video (01:23:45):  >When he goes to trial and is sentenced 3 years ago that now everybody magically thinks that didn't happen.  It's easy to look reasonable against a ridiculous claim. But the sexting did happen as it was the part where both the prosecution and defense agreed to. Regardless of his intentions, Drake still accepted responsibility that his actions harmed the victim.  In the tweets, Quinton alludes to a single victim. But in his video, he accused Drake of victimizing multiple minors, [implying]( full awareness of their ages:  * The Quiet on Set documentary by Investigation Discovery absolutely lets Drake Bell off the hook when it comes to his own misconduct with **minors**. The cycle of abuse is a real thing and it is tragic in a big way. But when Drake Bell was sexting **15 year olds** he was in his damn 30s. * ... not only does he deserve to be criticized for that in some cases he deserves to be made fun of it. And I don't regret making jokes about it because this is a man in his 30s sexting **15 year olds.**  I've read a couple rumors that referenced other victims, one of the incidents set in a high school. In the beginning of the video, Quinton told his audience he won't be including any rumors without sources. And yet his treatment of Drake's case highlighted a disconnect from his surgical and nuanced analysis of Schneider's wrongs. Strikingly opinionated instead of factual. And raises eye brows when one the few references he used for research was likely a puff piece.  Quinton also said (01:20:57) :  >Brian Peck was hired by Tollin and Robbins Productions. Dan Schneider had no role in the hiring process. And Brian (Peck) was not a registered sex offender when he was hired to work on these shows.  This claim is from Dan's apology video but it was not listed under resources Quinton used. So instead of saying, ""Dan said he was not involved in hiring Brian Peck"" it's presented as an undisputed statement of fact.  In 2002, the Los Angeles Times article cited Dan and Brian [working together]( in a comedy boot camp for kids. A year later Brian Peck would be [arrested]( for abusing a minor. Drake's father stated in the documentary that he previously reported Brian to executives. And when Drake was asked if any executives talked to him during the case, he said only Dan was there for him.  There weren't any known animosity between Dan and Drake. However Drake's legal issues on attempted child endangerment, disseminating material harmful to juveniles and texting a minor sort parallels to Dan's toxic workplace behavior endangering child actors on set, creating sexualized content for children and communicating with young actors and fans. The only difference was Drake was convicted and Dan wasn't even arrested. Drake ended up as the perfect foil, both as a sword and shield to Nickelodeon's biggest scandal.  The documentary is also not just about Drake Bell's life. He is just one of the [many voices]( that has bravely come forward to criticize institutions of power and systemic problems in the entertainment business. The documentary is also founded on investigative journalism that allowed allegations against Dan Schneider to be taken seriously. Some question the motives behind producing the documentary, instead of noticing its infectious effect on former Nickelodeon cast and crew coming forward. And lastly, the public coming to terms with their childhood experiences in relation to their media consumption.",belgeselsever,1bpup1q

Conspiracy..? I have heard Drake bring up a few times now that they really swept Brian's case under the rug/no media reporting.

What caused her mental breakdown, what caused her to tweet her truth, because it felt like it came out of nowhere, at least to me. I don’t really read or watch celebrities gossip things, especially back then when everyone was calling her names and berating her.

"Reflecting on my own experiences Watching the documentary last night has made me really reflect more on my own experiences growing up as a kid online (I was born in '92) and interacting with adults virtually in ways that I now recognize as grooming and downright pedophilia.  As early as age 10 and especially between ages 13-16, I was constantly exchanging sexual messages with adults online: both with adults I met online in chat rooms, and with adults whom I'd met in person (a family member of someone I went to school with, and a man I met at a community event my parents took me to as a teen). I'm very fortunate that I never had anything happen to my physical body—but it could have easily turned out that way.  I don't know that there is really a point to this post. I just felt like I needed to get it out and share that I'm feeling really disturbed looking back. As a kid/teen, I enjoyed and was excited about this attention and interactions with these adult men—but now, as an adult myself (and an advocate for survivors of sexual violence as part of my day job), I have a very different relationship to these memories.  This was such a rampant, common part of early internet culture for kids growing up in the '00s and no one really talks about it even now.   &#x200B;",belgeselsever,1brx0g4

About Drake and his story… I didn’t watch the whole first season. Mainly cause I don’t have access to it so I watched Drake’s parts of it on TikTok and to say I’m beyond upset is a massive understatement.

Like I don’t even know if what I’m about to say is okay in this context but I’ve got second hand trauma from just hearing about this. Hearing and watching Drake struggle to even think about the immense trauma and abuse he suffered at the hands of Brian Peck made me tear up and I still don’t know what to think or do since hearing this.   My heart goes out to every actor/actress who was abused by Dan and/or Brian. Especially to Amanda and Drake because what the actual fuck? Why on God’s green earth are men like Dan and Brian still allowed to fucking breathe? They’ve abused so many kids and get to walk free.

"Why were the other charges against Brian Peck dismissed? Does anyone have any idea why the other charges against Brian Peck were dismissed? I saw online that they were dismissed under 1385 PC, which basically = at the discretion of the prosecution or the court ""in the interests of justice"" after a plea is entered. I'm assuming maybe it's because of lack of evidence, but sexual assault cases often only have the testimony of the victim... so maybe Drake was uncomfortable with testifying, and that left the State with practically nothing...?  Obviously I know this could have been part of a plea deal but...I guess I don't understand why the State offered THAT level of benefit to Peck - dismissing 9 charges for the price of 2 (which don't even include sodomy/penetration). The multi-month gap between the plea (May), the dismissal (Oct), and the sentencing also perplexes me re: who was actually responsible for dismissing the remaining charges.

"Possible reference to John Wayne Gacy in Peck’s movie? Brian Peck made a short film called *The Willies* about 35 years ago.  I wasn’t paying close attention the first time I saw it. Most of the movie seemed normal on the surface. If you pay close attention, there are some clearly inappropriate scenes involving children. There are two scenes I want to hear your thoughts on.  1. A kid is having dinner with his parents. They see the antagonist old man on the news. The mom asks “what’s Old Man Spivey doing on TV?” The dad says “they probably found a few dead kids under his basement.” The movie came out in 1990. John Wayne Gacy was arrested in 1978. I don’t know when Peck’s fascination with JWG started, but I’m curious if you think that scene in his movie is Peck’s subtle way of winking at his serial killer friend who used to murder kids and bury them under his garage.  2. The same villain invites that kid into his barn because he wants to show the kid something. The kid reluctantly goes in but says “if I’m not home soon, my parents are calling the police.” The old man says “if you’re not home soon, your parents will have a party.” This might be a stretch, but I feel like Peck used that scene to relive the thrill of tricking a victim into going inside his house.",belgeselsever,1jq9h3i

What kind of mother allows her son to repeatedly sleepover at John Wayne Gacy's friend's house?   Especially after his father WARNED her.   What kind of law just allows her to allow that?

"Dan is not taking real responsibility The Dan Schneider interview is very indicative of the most important issue at hand (revolving around Dan). What I gathered from his interview is that he cannot truly accept responsibility for his actions. I understand what he means when he says “my bosses approved every script I wrote” or “if this material wasn’t approved It would not have been used”, but what saddens me is instead of taking responsibility for his own behalf and his own opportunity to move past his sick actions, he deflects his own ideas that HE wrote to his higher ups, saying “it’s not all my fault! They allowed it too!”, exactly like a child would do if they were to get into trouble. Dan Schneider crafted this interview for his own PR, yet since he has not actually taken responsibility for his actions, he ends up failing at what he set out to achieve. The proof shows through his words/facial expressions/mannerisms and everything. I think lack of true sincerity is hard to hide, when you don’t really mean it, it shows. I’m not the kind of person that would hope Dan Schneider rots or suffers the rest of his life,  but the reality is those kind of consequences are directly correlated to his lack of taking responsibility for his own actions, so all I can say is the choice is up to him, and all I can say about Dan Schneider is I hope one day he does grasp the full responsibility of his actions he continues to avoid.",belgeselsever,1bjzr2u

"Serious Question: Why do pedophiles exist? I wonder specifically about psychological or biological mechanisms that make people sexually attracted to (especially pre-pubescent) minors.  Two things I know that contribute: (1) some people get off on victimizing people with less power; and (2) survivors of childhood sexual abuse can sometimes grow into adults who then become perpetrators. I also want to point out the distinction between pedocriminals (people who have acted on their urges) and pedophiles (people who may or may not have acted on their urges. all pedocriminals are pedophiles, but not all pedophiles are pedocriminals). So, these two explanations explain pedocriminals but don't explain pedophiles who have not offended.  Is there research/thought on what psychological or biological elements make people develop sexual attraction to (especially pre-pubescent) minors (whether they've offended or not)?  It seems to me that answering this question is a necessary step in developing treatment options, which would ultimately keep people from acting on these feelings and ruining children's lives. If someone like Jason Handy, for example, recognized that he was having inappropriate attractions (which he did in his diary entries they share in the documentary), and if there were treatment options out there that he could have accessed, it could have very well saved his victims from what he did.",belgeselsever,1brvpnr

He’s for the people, the kids, and most importantly the truth.  No one ever speaks out and my theory is that if you speak out there’s a punishment. Millionaires in Hollywood have power they will hire pedophiles to run in your house do a home invasion and take you out.   Dan is obviously a sick man. I think he has a team of pedophiles behind him. I have many theories. If anybody responds tell me your opinion on why people don’t SPEAK UP(don’t bring up hush money) . If any of us went through what Drake went through no money in the world could stop us from getting justice. There’s a bigger game being played and I want everyone’s opinion.",belgeselsever,1bjx4jf
"Sus on Sunset Hey yall, I had a pretty good theory on the Nick on Sunset studios but that’s all it is a theory put together from this doc.   Remember when they mentioned Ezel Channel? His crime seemed too comfortable to do on Nickelodeon property. I know there’s rumors on the child trafficking in LA but this is, what he did after landing a job only a few months before commuting his crimes REALLY puzzles me. Getting a production assistant job and a few months later inappropriately contacting children it just doesn’t make sense being that during this time (2005) was a rising stardom for the network so why risk it? I understand that PDFiles can’t control themselves but ON Nickelodeon property is crazy wild to me you don’t think? I’m pretty sure there was a rumor mill going on regarding the easy access to children but I do feel like they should have gotten in more trouble being it happened at Nickelodeon in the parking lot. Handy has been handled he’s in federal prison til 2038.  As for Channel, this guy is loose in LA homeless and roaming the streets. I just can’t believe we can’t see any justice for these kids. How can these laws protect PDFiles over children???! Marty Weiss getting only a few months??! I highly recommend watching ‘An Open Secret’ that details these crimes including Drake Bells which was still anonymous when the doc came out in 2014 I believe. Hope yall are doing well.",belgeselsever,1ivp8k1
"Where are the other letters? Does anyone know why the other letters in the Brian Peck case haven’t been released to the public? If the doc unsealed ALL of them, where are they? Is it possible that they’re being protected? Because I can’t figure out any other reason they wouldn’t be released, seeing as we already have 12 of them. And people ARE interested in finding them.   EDIT: I get that it might be because those people are not public figures, but the case stands that the doc unsealed everything. Why wouldn’t anyone be able to get access to them if they’re unsealed? Especially since people have been looking for them. I’m just a bit confused.",belgeselsever,1c8zemj
"Question about episode 2 - the All That table read I’m a little late to the party but I just started watching and I finished episode 2 and I cannot help but wonder: what was the point of announcing Peck’s arrest at the table read and asking if someone has anything to say?  Was it a power move by Dan? Were they trying to find the “snitch”? Was it general concern there were others?  And what the actual f*** about making the parents leave the room?! And the parents actually listened?!  Needless to say this episode really f***ed me up. I cannot believe all the shit with Jason Handy. And he only got 6 years!

"Really Feel Bad For Those Former Child Stars Now as Nickelodeon Wasn't A Fun Place Makes you feel very bad over on those former actors or current ones now adults. If they manage to be still in the acting business. But really horrific people like Dan Schneider made it an environment of a hostile toxic workplace. Sadly these kids didn't have a say like they would probably have in this era of like #MeToo! The studio saw the red flags but it seemed to chose over in the ignoring the kids mental and emotional state for money, power, and ratings.   Just that some may have had rough adulthoods like Drake Bell and Amanda Bynes have had. While others like Melissa Joan Hart have succeed as adults. It all depends on how they handled it. But those interviewed on the four part special and in those who were interviewed to promote it.  This documentary would never had gotten made by any and all means back in the 1990's. Never will look at another Nickelodeon show like that ever again.",belgeselsever,1bsql4l
Brian peck was the father on drake and Josh in pilot? In the video at the 1209 mark they say that the show had to replace the dad and shoot a second pilot. They didn't say why but it would have been in 2003/4 before Brian was convicted.   Wondering If nickelodeon originally agreed to brian even though drake refused. But then I wonder why nickelodeon  would agree when the two were in the middle of a lawsuit?  Maybe just a coincidence and had to hire a new person and it wasnt actually Brian but some man that didn't want to anymore or nickelodeon didn't want to use anymore after seeing the original pilot?,belgeselsever,1bpmgw2

"Trying to reconcile my feelings towards the celebs who wrote letters in support of BP Sometimes I’ll hear a story of an actor doing shitty things (ie all the stuff that came out during the #metoo movement) but I’ll still watch their films and ignore my personal feelings towards them. It’s hard to not make excuses for an actor you love so instead I just try not to think about it (Kevin Spacey, James Franco, etc.). I don’t know what’s acceptable, I just know that there are certain movies I love that I want to be able to keep watching.  But I’m having a hard time reconciling my feelings towards an actor like James Marsden, whom I like a lot, and how disgusting  what he said in his letter to BP was.   I listened to the Boy Meets World podcast episode where they try to explain what happened and take responsibility for it but also try to understand why they were able to fall for what BP did. They made the issue seem very nuanced - they were tricked themselves, they had no idea the extent of what happened - they had no reason to believe he was lying about what happened - etc, and it all sounds convincing, but then I keep thinking about it and am disgusted all over again.  I don’t know what my point is exactly - maybe just to start a discussion on how to reconcile these feelings. Will you never watch these actors again? Will you watch them but in the back of your mind know that they are shitty people? Will you watch them and make excuses for them?   Can these people be redeemed? Do their apologies (the few that were given) seem genuine or do you think they’re just saving face?",belgeselsever,1bot3t0

I can't say with 100% certainty what he did or did not do in that regard, and this post isn't necessarily meant to be about those specific allegations. However, I found it very interesting that this Doc shined a brief light on Bynes's father's ""presence"" on set, painting it as somewhat intense, controlling, and intimidating.  Does anyone else have any more information re: what her father was like during Bynes's time at Nickelodeon? Even if it's not directly about s\*\*xual abuse, I'm curious in general about his personality and the role he played in her life at the time. It's hard to find much info on that outside of Amanda's previous tweets and what was said in this Doc.",belgeselsever,1bnmu3f

"FYI for those judging parents First lemme say, it sickens me too that these kids were unprotected by their parents.  This is not a defense of the actions of the parents in the documentary. (ETA: i myself am a survivor of csa in which my parents could have and failed to protect me.  I’m also a parent doing my best to protect my own kids.  Everything I am saying is coming from my own lived experience and mine alone.)  Many have posted to the effect of “how could those parents have let their kids be around/in communication with those abusers?”  And there is no single explanation, of course.  Some parents are simply incapable or unwilling to protect their children.  But.  *Not every parent who allows their kid around a predator is a bad parent.*  If you disagree, you are unwittingly part of the problem.  In order to prevent child sexual abuse, we must ALL recognize that we could be groomed by a predator to let our guard down too.  Anyone who thinks they would simply *know* if a person was a pedophile is misguided at best.  It takes a lot of guts, more than many people have, to stand up to an adult that everyone around you expects you to like and to trust, and say that you won’t allow your child to be alone with them.    I know because I see it every single day.  People let their kids go to daycares, be watched by babysitters or relatives, send them to camps or sleepovers, let them catch a ride with a trusted neighbor or friend’s parent.  It only takes a second to molest a child, and pedophiles know how to become the trusted adult that parents are happy to have in their child’s life.    Try this thought experiment.  Imagine the person in your life that you believe is LEAST likely to sexually abuse a child.  Now imagine a child confiding in you that this same person molested them.  How are you going to respond?  Will you instantly believe them or will you be skeptical?  Now,  imagine that you have decided to never allow your child to be alone one-on-one with another adult, including extended family.  How would your parents and siblings react to that rule?  Will they be receptive or say you are being over the top? Will them understand or will they be angry that you could even imagine one of them abusing your child?  These are the questions we need to be asking ourselves.  Not “how could Drake Bell’s mom let him spend the bight at Brian Peck’s house?” or “why did Brandi’s mom let her email with a full-grown man?”  But “what am I doing to make sure no child in my life becomes the victim of a child predator?”",belgeselsever,1buzvi4

CSA is way more prevalent than we realize and I think its because of CSA perps in power that control its information I've grown up watching true crime as a since the 90s. Ty Americas Most Wanted for taking up my saturday nights.   I noticed an alarming pattern. The AMOUNT of CSA cases took up a large portion. It made me realize this is a LOT more CSA happening than society was aware of back then. The amount of parents who are severely unaware about CSA is mind boggling. But they are aware of homicide and other crimes.  My suspicions about the hidden prevalence of CSA were confirmed when the Jeffrey Epstein issue came out. I have a theory there is a high amount of people in power that committ CSA are able to control how much is out there on CSA so that prevents parents from being aware.

From what I’ve personally gathered, It seems like Josh is under an NDA himself and that is why he hasn’t publicly criticized Dan or Nickelodeon. In his Tana Mongeau interview where he says Dan was just a “tough boss”, to me seems telling that he definitely was paid hush money. I absolutely am not defending him for this, and think he should be more vocal in defending drake bell.   Something I do think it’s noteworthy is that we know that Dan was incredibly misogynistic and much of his inappropriate behavior was aimed specifically at women.   As drake stated himself, Dan was the “only one that was there for him” & he “doesn’t blame Dan for hiring Brian”.   I can only think that the men/boys working for Dan weren’t treated anywhere near as terribly as the women. Not to discredit any men that were treated poorly by him, but it seems that he targeted women more often than not.  If this is all true, (the inequity in how men were treated vs women, & him being under an NDA, I don’t think it’s surprising at all that his only criticism of Dan at this time is that he was a “tough boss”.  I think we should take Drake’s word for it and acknowledge Josh has reached out to him privately, and take it a *little* easy on him as we support Drake through his healing journey.

What sad and pathetic loser needs that level of control over people that he physically, mentally and sexually abuses people, including children, and constantly needs to flex his authority over people with significantly less in life?  Clearly, no one who treats people the way he did is a happy, stable person.",belgeselsever,1bjzyug

"Happy Happy Joy Joy: The John Kricfalusi/Spumco story. Last night I watched [Happy Happy Joy Joy: The Ren and Stumpy Story](  As I'd mentioned it in another thread as being comparable to ""Quiet On Set"", I wanted to give a short summary.  The focus of the show is on the bad attitude and aggressive workplace behaviour of [John Kircfalusi](   Kricfalusi was a bully, a tyrant, an abuser of his friends and staff members and romantic partners. He was a manic obsessive about the drawings and other things turned in for publication who often rejected perfectly good work for no good reason other than, it seems, because it wasn't from his own hand. Costing the company hundreds of thousands of dollars and causing the late delivery of whole episodes to Nickelodeon, as he just couldn't stop micromanaging everything. This caused a lot of emotional trauma to his employees.  This bears some similarities to Schneider. The workplace abuses of power. John K didn't get inappropriate massages on site, and aren't allegations of other people who worked at Spumco being inappropriate with minors.  The other area of note is Kricfalusi's relationship with underage girls.  Had a girl who he was penpals with, which later developed into a sexual relationship, and there are other women who have come forward saying they had inappropriate relationships with him, and that he groomed them when they were under age.",belgeselsever,1bn2nd1

"Accusations of domestic abuse against Drake Bell from an ex-girlfriend (no idea if true or not) EDITED TO ADD: Having read more accounts from Drake Bell's ex-girlfriends, I believe what they're saying and that Bell beat them.  In August 2020, Bell's ex, Melissa Lingafelt, accused Drake Bell of physical and verbal abuse in their romantic relationship from 2006 - 2009, and also said he had been grooming teenaged girls:   A visual summary of her videos (which she took down) is here, and another Bell ex, Paydin Layne LoPachin, also said Bell was physically and verbally abusive.    This was during the 18 month criminal investigation during which Bell was charged for inappropriate texts to a teenaged girl, to which he pleaded guilty in July 2021.   Lingafelt said more people would come out against Bell. [  Bell denied Lingafelt's accusations and claimed that Lingafelt had approached him earlier in 2020 for money, which he gave her. Bell further said he was reviewing his legal options: [  Ever since *Quiet on the Set* was aired, Lingafelt says she's been receiving abusive messages from Bell's fans. This NBC article summarizes Lingafelt's reaction to those messages, and includes a comment from Bell about Lingafelt's claims. Bell says: “Never went to court for this. This was a complete lie. This never went anywhere.”  Presumably, that means he did not pursue a defamation suit against Lingafelt.  Bell never addressed LoPachin's accusations.   [  There is something people have seized upon: Lingafelt described the alleged verbal abuse from Bell in these words:  *“And when I say verbal abuse, imagine the worst type of verbal abuse you could ever imagine, and that was what I got. “It then turned into physical – hitting, throwing, everything. At the pinnacle of it, he \[dragged\] me down the stairs of our house... My face hit every step on the way down.""*  Bell used similar wording describing Brian Peck. Asked what Peck did to him, Bell said:  *""Why don't you do this? Why don't you think of the worst stuff that someone could do to somebody as sexual assault? And that will answer your question.""*  Two people who dated for three years could absorb rhetorical techniques from each other, but it's certainly curious.  I don't know for a fact that what these women say is true. But these two women, both Bell's exes, accused him of physical and verbal abuse, and I believe them. Bell is obviously dealing with trauma and mental illness from being raped as a child, but that's not and never can be an excuse for beating women.",belgeselsever,1bs1n2q

"Episode 5 was racist/ boy who cried wolf BS There’s a little story called the boy who cried wolf many forget in this day and age but it says you shouldn’t claim something is there if it isn’t or you’ll just train people to distrust the claim.  &#x200B;  When they played the race card for clout it was so painful, especially as a black man.   &#x200B;  “Why did Amanda bones get more attention than the black cast? Racist!” No it’s called the AMANDA show.  &#x200B;  “We were told don’t make a fuss for being spat on in the spit take gag. I wanted to flip out on her for being racist and spitting on me! They said she’s the star! Like we mattered less!”  That’s literally the exact same thing a white or ANY race person woulda been told if you’re a bit character and they’re the star. Spitting water on you isn’t racist spit takes are common in sketch shows and they’ve been around for over 100 years. They woulda cried racist if it was a white person being spat on and no “representation “ (btw fuck representation! Nobody represents me but me! You can’t point to a black dude on tv and say he represents all of us that’s stereotyping. THAT is racist. Just like using the race card in vein for clout )  &#x200B;  Racism is stupid and terrible and real but if we call everything racist, then people are gonna be offput and often are by it. When Hollywood wouldn’t do George Lucas’ red tails ONLY because it was a black cast,yeah that was racist. A 8 year old girl just doing a script? No she’s not racist but she’s attacked online for it.

I watched Quiet on Set and found it horrible and fascinating, but I did feel uncomfortable with how they barely discussed Drake's own abusive behaviors, and how his victims were given no voice at all.

"Parents on set or at home This documentary really showed the tragedy these victims faced at the hands of these pedophiles. One thing that really struck me from this documentary was the parents. I keep reading comments, like, how could the parents let this happen, and I can only think about how manipulated some of these parents were too.  Some of these parents are victims themselves.  They were gaslight, manipulated, and groomed by a system that they thought their children would be safe in. They trusted professionals to handle their children’s careers and their lives. While some parents were straight up terrible people, some parents may have been very naïve to what was happening or felt helpless themselves. I can’t imagine what horror they are feeling. It makes me think about how many institutions do parents leave their children with thinking they’re safe like school, church, summer camps or a sports team, to only find themselves is this very situation with their children. I hope there is a support group for parents who also fall victim to predators like this.   After my last post and reading some comments, I also keep thinking about parents in America who have been manipulated by Nickelodeon and fallen victim to these predators .they had these predators in their own homes on their children’s tvs.  How many parents watched these shows and saw how sexualized these kids were and did nothing. How many never noticed? Were they unaware, naive, or uncomfortable? Did parents speak up? Did they  think there kids were safe watching a children’s network?  I also have been thinking about the parents that I used to think we’re really prudish for not letting their kids watch certain shows and now I’m wondering if they were just really aware of something fucked up . How many of them were mocked or shamed for being uptight?   Nickelodeon gave a platform for pedophiles to entertain children across the world and entertain sick fucking adults too. How many pedophiles watched these shows that sexualized children with their own families.?  I think there needs to be  a stronger discussion about educating parents on the signs, behaviors, and risks of grooming, manipulation and pedophilia in different forms. Globally we got to wake up and stop trusting. Children fall victim to predators everywhere and I don’t think there’s a lot of open discussion on what to do when you’re in that situation, and how to cope with that. They’re such a high risk for children and many of us, including parents, clearly are missing the signs because we have been watching these shows for years. parents, how are you handling this?

They are trying to move forward in their lifetime they do not need to relive trauma, think if this was your OWN spouse, child, family member, girlfriend, college buddy.  2. Corey Feldman & Corey Haim Docu series  \- ok what is the update on charlie sheen? After his docuseries the rape of two coreys, it breaks my heart knowing that charlie sheen denied it all? I mean what the heck? Do these people get to live their lives like just move on? I do not get it. I see him, his wife and kid just living life. Like is this for real? I do not expect any prison since Corey H. passed away at 38 RIP. However, he denies it, whereas in Drake Bell's situation Brian Peck admitted it.   3.

[Original Thread](  [Moderation Log](  [PoliticBot Log](  [Bot 1](  [Bot 2](  [Bot 3](  This is clear proof that users related to /r/conspiratard are spreading disinformation with a bot network.  right now there is another submisson on the  frontpage of /r/conspiracy accusing the moderators of /r/news and /r/restorethefourth being shills which also didn't get removed.    I am now for some time active in /r/conspiracy and was even moderator but when Flytape thinks its correct to ban me for exercising my free speech so be it.  Somebody messaged me more accounts of the bot network posting all over reddit trying to ridicule truth seekers with obvious false comments,racism and promoting disinformation.   /u/RoyLuhza  /u/ComradeBobalinski  /u/TheDudeWithTude  /u/BeatrceCasaDelBianco  /u/62_Beatnik  /u/CaptainSalubrious       **Source Text:**  W  i noticed that his text pattern is always the same but under diffrent accounts.  he is pushing disinformation mainly against Alex Jones and David Icke while promoting the Zionist Agenda.  he has also posted in /r/conspiratard which with [BipolarBear0]( already has proof of /r/conspiratard engaging in promoting the Zionist Agenda.  F  I have to remove this because it encourages vote brigading and/or witch hunting.  W  Come on Flytape, you can't be serious /r/conspiratard whole purpose is witchunting and downvote brigades.  This is a subreddit about conspiracies and free spech, do i really have to remind you of that?       These threads contain the same information and have reached the frontpage in the last few days without a action from the mods.  At least ask the other moderators to give there consent of this decision before removing it.  F  I wouldn't hang out here if we were like conspiratard.  (Witch hunts and vote brigades)  Careful not to stare into the abyss too long, you might become the thing you hate.  W  I wouldn't mind it if you would not enforce a double standard on me like i showed you on my previous answer.  There are a lot threads and comments which go further than this without getting removed.  This is censorship random enforced.  I will repost my theard tomorrow.  F  If you start posting links to specific user's profiles with accusations of shill/not/NSA/troll/etc, it will earn you a ban.  W  Look who posted in my subreddit /r/conspiracydocumentary.

"We’re in the Endgame now In 2020, the world as we knew it, would forever be changed, and it will never be the same.   On March 13th, 2020 - the world would watch as Donald Trump would declare the first ever 50 state, state of emergency. Like many watching, I couldn’t believe what was unfolding before my eyes, and that day and in the blur and fog of what was transpiring that day something inside of me clicked.   Maybe it was the fact that none of it made sense, or the fact that I had been waiting for this  event my whole life - but in the end what did it for me was the numbers.   Was it a coincidence that the United States would declare its first ever state of Emergency on March 13th? The same day that Pope Francis would celebrate his 7 year anniversary, the same day that would see the death of Breonna Taylor, the same day - 23 years earlier - that some strange lights would engulf the nighttime Phoenix Arizona skies? 2 days after the world health organization would declare Covid-19 a global pandemic. On March 11th, the same day that 18 years earlier the United States would send two blue light beams into the infinite vastness of space, a message “into the unknown” from 9/11’s ground zero.   I don’t believe in coincidence and whether you know it or not, we live in the matrix, and it has a language. It’s called Gematria - a code hidden in plain sight, in letters and numbers, in bedded in our every day life. Nothing has ever been real.   Let me prove it to you.   It’s been quite the journey, for all of us, and it’s far from over. So buckle up, and hold on to each other because in this world, it has and always will be us vs them. There is no left; there is no right - don’t let them keep taking us from each other.   …the aliens aren’t coming, they’ve never left   [The Return 1](  [The Return 2](  [The R3TURN](  [The Return: Full Circle](

"The Obama / Osama Deception - After Watching This Series, you Will Understand the Biggest Orwellian Presidential Psy-Op of All Time If you feel like it's weird that Barack Hussein Obama happened to appear after the overthrow of Hussein and then deposed the new ""Boogyman"" Osama, you are not nuts.. it was a well designed a subliminal mind f.    (Part 1 -  The Media ""Mix Ups"" the Physical Resemblances, and ""The New Obama Videos - Obama played Osama in ""no sound"" videos)  What are the Odds that the world's ""most wanted boogie man Osama"" would have practically the same name as the man hunting him down and ""killing him"" Obama?  ""The Bigger the lie the easier it is to believe""  Obama is Osama? Obama Osama Obama Osama Obama Osama.. it's an easy mistake to make (on purpose). Of course those in ""the know"" know that Obama never officially changed his name form Barry Soetoro.  There is a reason the public and media keep ""slipping up"" talking about Osama/Obama- the reason is actually subliminally intentional- we (the American people) are supposed to subliminally connect Osama and Obama.  The freaky reality is that Mr./ Obama (who has had a name-change from Barry Sotoero) was in fact groomed to become president after just a few years as a practically unknown Senator and become the adversary of Osama- and his name change was in fact done to connect subliminally the overthrow of Saddam Hussein (middle name) and then confront ""Osama"".  Part 2 of this video will explain more of the connections between Obama and his funding to attend Harvard by Saudi Arabia- that's right the same nation Osama supposedly got his funding from.  Most people don't even know Barry Soetoro went to Pakistan and Afghanistan before becoming president and getting his name change.  The videos of Bin Laden after 2001 were obviously staged- Who was the actor though is the main question?...     ""Obama's"" (Soetoro's). background is completely contrived- No record of him at Columbia (professors there say he didn't go there) When exactly did Mr. Barry Soetoro really change his name? It was apparently long after attending Occidental College in California where he was doing drugs (admittedly).. He was of course funded by the Saudis going to college at Harvard.. Funny- that's the same nation Bin Laden.was from and got his funding from... probably just a big coincidence!  Of course a coked-up Larry Sinclair talking about giving Obama (Barry Soetoro). a B.J., while Barry smoked crack cocaine in a limousine in Gurnee Illinois is a side note.  Then, another coincidence- The fake Osama videos post 2001 look almost exactly like Obama wearing a few minor additions- an nose extension, accentuated eyebrows and a fake beard- Osama/Obama seem to look like exactly the same person, minus the obvious faked Hollywood-esque nose extension / Eyebrow accentuation and makeup.  Turns out Mr. Barry Soetoro also was in Afghanistan and Pakistan before becoming president!... wow, what a coincidence!- the 3 countries that would later be involved in the ""War on Terror"" Osama nonsense- and it turns out that the actor they end up using looks almost exactly like Obama/Osama, with a fake nose- and a color correction (change the hue on the video, and it's a spitting image).  What is the difference between Obama and Osama ? only BS  Of course there is no sound in the latest ""Osama"" videos- because it isn't actually Osama and the videos are obviously faked.  At first, I thought this was totally impossible, that Mr. Soetoro would be faking a video of the man he was ""hunting down"" the more I looked into it, the more I realized this video had to be made, I will go into more detail in a second video- Showing the connections to Saudi Arabia/Afghanistan and the entire lying fake background of the cocaine addict Barry Soetoro gets his dick sucked by Larry Sinclaire.  If you are confused after watching this video - I am not saying Osama was always Obama, I am saying after 2001, after a few body doubles were used (the fat Bin Laden wearing a watch and a ring against Islamic code), Mr. Barry Soetoro was eventually subbed in to play the evil boogie-man Goldstein Bin Laden- which is likely why he was groomed to become president after only a few years as a Senator.  Barack Obama never even legally changed his name from Barry Soetoro- But most Americans subliminally connected him to both Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden via his fake (although he never officially changed name).   (Part 2- The Name Change, the Fake Background, and the ""Grooming"" of Barry Soetoro into the president Barack Hussein Obama who would ""kill"" Osama)  The last part of this 2 video series looked into the extremely controversial possibility that Mr. Barry Soetoro aka Barack Obama could possibly be one and the same as a person playing in the later fake Osama videos..  This would of course rest on the assumption that Barry Soetoro lied about everything in his background- and didn't have the name Barack Hussein Obama as long as he claimed he had had it.  Well, as we learn (those who research this stuff) it turns out that is exactly the case- not only was Barry Soetoro lying about his name- and lying about the schools he went to and lying about being a ""Constitutional Law Professor"" at the University of Chicago-  His pathway to becoming president (using a fictitious name) was also groomed via his run as a Senator in Illinois against men who were set up to fail.  You have to ask yourself, what the odds that a man with a name as strange as ""Barack Hussein Obama"" would become president after a long war with a man named ""Hussein"" who would eventually kill a man named ""Osama"" - What are the odds that this would happen- - First Hussein then, Osama, and that this president would also have had a name change- but not officially.  Then, you have to think about the likelihood that his president would also look almost exactly like the man that shows up in the later videos - A modern day Goldstein.  Of course- the later videos of Osama look absolutely nothing like the latter videos of Osama- in which the man playing Osama looks extremely similar to Obama.  What are the odds the ""Hero"" who fights against the ""War on Terror"" would Kill the ""Terrorist"" who happens to have almost exactly the same name he has? And that this president would have been funded by the same people (Saudi Royalty) that the man he killed supposedly was funded by? Any stats majors watching these videos?  Then, you would have to look into the odds that this man- whose name was changed also happened to have traveled to Pakistan, and Afghanistan, two of the countries involved in the later ""war on terror"" he would be fighting against before becoming president- when few average Americans travel to these countries.  Also, the fact that he lied about his name during attending Occidental College in LA- then lied about attending Columbia University, and finally was allowed into Harvard (allegedly) with his way paid by Saudi Arabian royalty - A Saudi Prince who later donated 10 Million to ""help rebuild New York after 9/11"" and also ""donated"" 20 Million to Harvard after helping Obama into Harvard- Hush Money?.  Of course- then ""Barry Soetoro"" became a ""Constitutional Law Professor"" at the University of Chicago- which also turns out to be a fat lie- he was a ""guest professor"" there- teaching only 1 class a year originally, eventually 3 who never published any scholarly writings.  Barry was not good enough to get the job on his own merits- instead he was given the job through connections via the board of trustees- Who insisted he get the job, even though he wasn't qualified.  After being forced into he position Barry had an extremely low rating at Chicago, and never attended any sort of faculty meetings and was ""hated"" because it was a ""stepping stool"" for him.  Then- after that- He made his way into the Senate through a very interesting coarse of events- First winning vs. the much favored Blair Hull (right when running the Chicago Times broke the story his wife accused him beating her)- then he ran vs. Jack Ryan whose wife accused him of being a sexual pervert-  Of course, then Barry was against Alan Keyes who had no chance of winning (telling the truth about who Obama actually was and sounding like conspiracy theorist).  The rest is really history-  The truth is Obama never legally changed his name to Barack Hussein Obama- Obama's name is still legally Barry Soetoro.  Obama lost his law degree (yet was still an editor for the Harvard Law Review) Obama somehow got into Harvard with faked credentials - never having actually attending Columbia, and having attended Occidental as Barry Soetoro.  This man was groomed to become president since at least 15 years ago to become president, he had a name change to a name that resembles that of 2 of the most reviled middle eastern enemies deposed.  There are simply too many ""coincidences"" to ignore, and his background was too groomed to ignore- the fact that this man who would become president had his name changed from Barry Soetoro to Hussein Obama (but never legally) cannot be overlooked.  He has lied about every single aspect of his background, and has been helped into the White House every step of the way.  Absolutely every single thing in his background is a lie- and every single step of the way he was helped to become president- all the while doing so with a fictions name.  That doesn't even cover his (admitted) drug background- and male prostitute propensities which serve as the perfect background for a well groomed presidential puppet.",belgeselsever,1qk0yj

"Artemisia Gentileschi: One of the Most Underrated artists in History Mini documentary about a women who overcame horrible obstacles in her life.   Artemisia Gentileschi's rape trial was a traumatic and difficult experience for her. In 1611, when she was just 18 years old, she was raped by her tutor, Agostino Tassi. Gentileschi's father, also a painter, pressed charges against Tassi, and the case went to trial.  During the trial, Gentileschi was subjected to a humiliating examination and was forced to testify under torture. Despite this, she remained resolute and provided a detailed account of the assault. Tassi was found guilty but received a lenient sentence.  The trial had a lasting impact on Gentileschi's life and art. Many of her subsequent paintings depicted strong, heroic women, and some art historians believe that her work was influenced by her personal experiences.  Today, Gentileschi's trial is seen as a testament to the strength and resilience of women in the face of injustice and trauma.  #art #artist #arthistory",belgeselsever,12dq43i

But I just watched Abducted in Plain Sight and I need to talk about this with someone else who has seen it. I don’t even know where to begin?? It’s the most infuriating true crime documentary I’ve ever seen. I am never one to victim blame but I’m legitimately struggling to find an ounce of compassion for the parents here. I know they were victims of manipulation. I know there has to be a connection between their naïveté and being LDS - it honestly enrages me that being LDS or any other extreme religion seems to make people far more susceptible to violent crime (that’s anecdotal, I realize it’s not necessarily a fact).   Anyway…I’m just speechless and cannot believe this story is real. I can’t believe the parents admitted all of this on camera? The mom seems still wistful about her past relationship with B?

"Been following an old capital murder case from 1998, dude wrongfully convicted of murder, was given a life sentence and this past week after 26 years it was reopened. # The doc is called Stolen Freedom. There's a trailer for it out on Youtube and it doesn't have much traction, but I've been looking into the case a bit. Apparently on New Years Eve 1997, like 60 people were hanging out in a parking lot at a gas station in Houston, Texas listening to music, trunks open, model cars out. The crowd at the gas station was all aged at around 21. After midnight, a troubled 14-year-old from the area came into the parking lot and got into a dispute with a few people in front of a nice car. He was high and intoxicated, got upset and pulled out a gun. A 21-year-old guy from his neighborhood who had seen the kid around saw him doing this and didn't want him to make a mistake that could cost him his life in prison, so he ran over to the 14-year-old kid, told him to stop, pulled on his arm, and the kid turned the gun on him. At this point the people in front of the nice car once being held at gunpoint took off running. The 14 year old turned back around, panicked and fired twice, killing the owner of the car. Within 60 seconds, that parking lot was empty. Over the course of a week or so, somehow police got the impression that the 21 year old (who tried to stop the kid) was actually an accomplice because he was older. The police also believed it was an attempted robbery of the car instead of a dispute. When it was all said and done, the 21 year old (Roman Flores) was brought to trial as an accomplice to a capital murder (because of the ""attempted robbery""), and couldn't pay to represent himself well. He was assigned by the Houston courts an attorney named Jerry Guirenot who has had 39 death row cases and lost every single one. Needless to say, Roman was poorly represented, not able to tell his side of the story, and given a life sentence. He's spent the past 26 years in prison. A non-profit attorney started working on his case for free 4 years ago, and just this past week, it got re-opened and he's going back to trial. The doc is trying to raise funding for the filming of the trial right now, but its an interesting story so far.",belgeselsever,1ejnrr5

I have to do a deep dive and see if she got out of prison in 2023 when her appeal came up.   The fishy part is that she seems to have given the baby away too easily. She may have just given it to anyone so she could get to her friends wedding on time.  That I would believe more than Andrew Norris.,belgeselsever,1h5b174

"The Tragic Story of Nohema Graber: A Dedicated Teacher Murdered by Her Students Nohema Graber, 66, was a respected and beloved Spanish teacher in the small town of Fairfield, Iowa. Originally from Mexico, she had an impressive career as an airline pilot before dedicating herself to education. Her peaceful life was brutally cut short in November 2021 when she was found dead in a local park, the victim of a horrifying murder.  The investigation revealed that two of her students, Willard Miller and Jeremy Goodale, both 16 years old, were responsible for the crime. Frustrated by a poor grade they blamed Nohema for, they devised a plan to take revenge. After luring her to an isolated spot during her daily walk, they beat her to death with a baseball bat and concealed her body under a tarp.  The two teens were incriminated by their own Snapchat messages, where they proudly detailed the crime. These messages became a key piece of evidence for investigators. The motive—a bad grade—shocked the community, exposing a disturbing lack of remorse and emotional maturity in the young men.  This case left a deep scar on Fairfield. Nohema Graber, who viewed education as a way to bridge cultures and inspire her students, was murdered by the very people she sought to help. She has become a tragic symbol of the growing tensions between students and teachers in a world where frustration can escalate into unimaginable violence.  Today, her story raises critical questions:  - Could warning signs have been detected earlier?  - How can teachers be better protected from such acts of violence?  - Do academic pressures play a larger role in Buch tragedies than we realize?  The memory of Nohema Graber lives on through her students, colleagues, and loved ones, who continue to advocate for greater understanding and prevention of school-related violence.",belgeselsever,1h52m2s

I can't remember the name of this documentary or which platform it was streamed on, but hopefully the description will help someone in this community remind me the title of it. The documentary discusses the mysterious disappearances of several hikers in the mountains of California, and towards the end the most memorable story is told by a man who has been going on annual camping trips to the mountains of California by horseback with some friends of his. He talks about mysterious sites and sounds that he's heard over the decades, up there, and one year having the most frightening and memorable experience of all.   He tells the story that that he and his friends rode their horses up to their remote campsite as they always did every year, and during the night, they heard loud crashing noises and non-human, non-animal, growling and grunting noises that they could not explain, and they were so frightened that they all piled into a huge hollowed out tree stump, and were able to successfully take cover while whatever creature was making the noise, eventually passed over their area, leaving them unharmed. He talks about how terrified all of them were and how it took them years before they all felt emotionally able to return to this  camping spot.  That was descriptive enough!

"How Jeffrey Brooks Died on the Beenleigh Crayfish Farm in 1996 **Everyone has been looking at the accident all wrong. Jeffrey Brooks did not shoot himself while getting out of the car on that fatal afternoon, it happened when he was getting into the car.**  The following explains:  * why Jeffrey used the old gun * the wet hat * the impossible angle * the distance from the nozzle * the entry wound size * the pool of blood * why no one wanted to kill Jeffrey * and why no one could have  &#x200B;  **THE DAY JEFFREY BROOKS DIED**  All workers gathered in the farm office for cookies and coffee that morning. There was Hans Geiger (farm manager) Regine Geiger (his wife) Graham Lloyd (farm hand) and Jeffrey Brooks (resident biologist). Hans was officially on holidays but had some farm related things to do that day such as making phone calls and going into Beenleigh to run some errands. Regine used to work on the farm, but business was slow, and she wasn’t needed at the time. She spent most of her time at the house that she and Hans lived in. It was located on the other side of the farm. Graham had his usual routine that day, and there was plenty for him to do. He always finished off with feeding the Crayfish in the afternoon before heading home. Jeffrey was in charge that day. He was the farm manager while Hans had time off. The conversation was mainly about the previous days meeting, where they found out that the farm was winding down and everyone was losing their job. The farm couldn’t be saved, and the owners decided they wanted to sell the farm instead. Hans put his hand up at the meeting and said that he was interested in buying the business off them. He’d needed to do some research though before he could present a genuine offer. No one expected the business to sell quickly, but him buying the business would have given everyone the opportunity to stay on too.  Jeffrey was the first to leave the group and they all laughed as he headed out the office. Everyone reminded him that he had to go to the city that afternoon, to pick up a package from the airport. He acknowledged that with his cookie monster impersonation and headed out onto the farm in the red farm ute. Jeffrey had already grabbed the old 12-gauge shotgun on an earlier round that morning. He was quite used to having the old gun in the car, but it was never left in the car overnight. It was locked in the office, no exceptions. Hans always grabbed the gun first thing in the morning when he did his first round across the farm. It was mainly to shoot at birds that were eating the Crayfish, but snakes were quite common on the farm too. Hans and Jeffrey routinely took the gun with them when they jumped out of the ute and walked around the ponds. Regine and Graham never used any of the two guns that were locked in the office. Both weren’t shooters and weren’t interested in using the old shotgun or the .22 calibre rifle. Apparently, Jeffrey didn’t like the old gun. Must have been because it was older than the Titanic and even had hose clamps holding the timber stock together. But he never hesitated to use it when he took the ute for a drive across the farm. Everyone even heard Jeffrey shoot that gun during the day. He did have a NSW shooters license and also had his own gun, which he showed off to everyone one day. But that was the first and last time anyone ever saw his gun. He just used the old gun instead. That day was his turn to grab the old gun and put it in the ute, which he did.  Hans made phone calls to the Brisbane Water Board to find out about the lease terms for the farm as the property was resumed by the Government in 1989 for a proposed dam project, just after Hans build the farm for a German investor. Hans and Regine then spent some more time at the farm shed washing the dogs before Hans made more calls to the Department of Labor & Industry regarding everyone’s entitlements. Graham was in and out the whole time keeping busy with chores. Hans and Regine headed over to the house they lived in, in the early afternoon. Regine stayed at the house while Hans headed back up to the shed to get the farms’ delivery car. This was the only registered vehicle on the farm, and the only one that was used to drive errant and deliveries. Hans noticed that Jeffrey was still out on the farm, because the red ute was not parked next to the shed. Hans wasn’t too concerned as there was still enough time before Jeffrey had to go. So Hans headed into town at 1:40pm to visit the wreckers, Franklins for groceries, and the muffler place to get some things for the farm cars that weren’t registered. He also stopped at the petrol station on his way back to the farm, where he topped up the delivery car.  The last few hours of Jeffrey’s life must have been tough. He was angry, frustrated, betrayed, let down, embarrassed and even sad all at once, but yet he was strong, and he knew he had to keep going. That’s the way he was raised, to never give up. His thoughts were all over the place. He was losing his job just when he thought he could build a future in Brisbane with his wife. They gave up everything in Lismore because he loved the Crayfish farm. He was working in his chosen profession, independent to the others, working at his own pace, seeing enormous potential in the business, but now it’s all gone. He’ll never get an opportunity like that again. He’ll have to start somewhere right down the bottom and work many years to where he is right now. And who knows where that will be. Where should he look? Will they get by just on Nicky's income? She only just started this new job. What about a family? Does this mean that starting a family is out of the question for now? How does Nicky feel about that? And now look at the time. He was running late to get to the airport. And now is peak hour traffic too.  He spent way too much time in the ponds thinking about everything that happened in the last 24 hours, and he simply lost track of time. He had to hurry and make up some time. He jumped up so fast that his hat came off and fell in the water. A shake or two and back on it went, no worries at all. He grabbed the old shotgun and climbed up the embankment towards the car. As he approached the red farm ute from the driver’s side, Jeffrey grabbed the loaded shotgun by the barrel and leaned into the driver’s side opening and maneuvered the gun across the driver’s seat and into the footwell of the passenger side, just like he had done many times before. Jeffrey was a big lad at six foot three, and there was no other way to get the gun in unless he walked around to the passenger side first and placed it in the car from there. He only did that the first few times he drove the ute, now he was comfortable doing it this way. Still, that move could not have been easy as the opening was tight for him to fit through and he was, even though the driver side door was removed long time ago. It was only a small Datsun ute that was a squeeze for anyone over six foot.  And he was tired and his body was aching from climbing in and out of ponds for most of the day.  As Jeffrey leaned into the car, he had to go in far enough to position the gun where it normally rests. Stock on the floor and the barrel leaning against the front edge of the passenger seat, white pointing up at the back window. It was hard for Jeffrey to bend down that far from his height. He tried to duck under the door frame, but accidently bumped his hat on the top of the door frame, causing the wet hat to slip off his head and fall to the ground. It landed just towards the front wheel of the ute. Rather than putting the gun all the way into the footwell first, Jeffrey stopped where he was, rested the shotgun stock on the passenger seat and turned to reach for his hat. He was still holding onto the gun barrel when he pulled back out of the car enough to turned to his right. He lowered himself onto his left knee and reached out for his hat with his right hand. That move not only lowered the gun barrel, but it also caused his left hand to rotate the gun onto its side. Jeffrey would not have realised that the gun was pointing straight at him. It all happened so fast and he was too busy looking to the right and reaching for his hat. He was in a hurry, tired, annoyed and mentally fatigued.    He grabbed his hat and shifted his whole weight onto his right leg ready to stand up again. Doing so made him turn to the left and as he did, his body pulled the gun towards himself, just enough that the hammer got caught on the passenger seat stitching and started to get pull back. A split second later it freed up and snapped forward at speed, hitting the back of the cartridge, igniting the gun powder and causing the gun to go off and discharge into Jeffreys upper torso. He was still down on his knee, leaning into the gun with his torso about 50cm from the barrel when the full load hit him. The impact blew him onto his back as he let go of the gun and hat. Shocked, winded and bleeding, Jeffrey had just enough strength to crawl into the ute, wanting to get help. The rest of his strength and willpower faded as he collapsed across both seats, knocking the gearstick into neutral, causing the car to roll backwards and halfway down the embankment.  Graham was out on the farm driving the feeder van. It was specially modified to throw food pellets out of one side and into the ponds as Graham drove past them. Very practical but extremely noisy. There was no way Graham could have heard the fatal shot. Eventually he did see the red ute halfway down the embankment. He headed straight over to see what was going on and found Jeffrey slummed across the front seats. Graham raced to the shed and rang for an ambulance and then rang the house. Hans only just got back from Beenleigh and was unloading the groceries at the house when Regine answered the phone. Hans headed straight to the shed and out to see Jeffrey. Hans then secured the ute to prevent it from rolling further back into the pond. Emergency services arrived shortly after.  A resident across the river did hear the fatal shot and remembered the exact time of 3:10pm. The time when Hans was still running errands in town, Regine was watching her TV show and Graham was doing his daily feeding round.  ***""The wound of the deceased was perfect on the edges. There was no sign of the (shotgun) pellets spreading,"" Mr Van de Walt said. Another sign of a close range shot was that Mr Brooks' chest was struck and then penetrated by an expanding plastic 'wad' component of the shotgun shell. ""I am of the opinion that the muzzle of the shotgun was between 10 and 80 centimetres from Mr Brooks's left shoulder during the discharge of the firearm,"" Mr Van de Walt said.***  &#x200B;  **THE CHANNEL 7 STORY**  **A case for murder: Investigating the death of Jeffrey Brooks | True Stories**  youtube.com/watch?v=g8rCw\_b5\_TQ  Presented by **Denham Hitchcock** from **12 GAUGE PRODUCTIONS** (rather tasteless business name don’t you think)  Everything in that show was leading the audience to just one answer, Jeffrey Brooks was murdered by a gang of criminals and justice was never served because the police botched the investigation. Accidental death was eliminated as a possible answer even though the medics and police on the day saw it for what it was, an unfortunate accident. They saw the scene, saw the deceased, interviewed the witnesses, analyzed their testimonies, established timelines and without any doubt in their minds ruled it as an accident. They didn’t even deem it necessary to test for gunshot residue or do a ballistics test after the autopsy. The story made the three farm workers look like villains who were helping themselves to the Crayfish and selling them on the side. A tight group who didn’t want Jeffrey on the farm and who would eventually get rid of him by shooting him and then cover it up and making it all look like an accident. Clever dramatization, visual sensationalism and hypothetical claims combined with grieving family members and expert testimony. And Denham even threw in a less than factual ballistic test with “the exact same weapon and ammunition”. Everything choreographed to leading viewers down one path, Murder! The story also focused on discrediting the police officer in charge of the investigation and why the evidence destruction years after the event was a coverup of a botched investigation. Denham even ambushed the workers at their homes some 22 years after the event. And he still refuses to believe the person who actually wasn’t on the farm at the time of the shooting, that he is innocent. Instead, Denham had an actor play out the scenario of him shooting Jeffrey and leaving him to die, in cold blood. This trial by media not only lead the audience down the wrong path but also fueled the parents’ obsession for answers, no matter what the cost, no matter at whose expense. Even though their mind was made up long ago that murder was the only answer they wanted to hear. They were convinced that Jeffrey was in danger, wasn’t welcome, had been threatened, had been shot at as a warning, and that he finally found evidence that the three farm workers were stealing from the farm. Jeffreys last words to one of the business owners were “Curiosity killed the cat” when he found a secret black book that recorded cash transactions. But there was no secret black book. It was the petty cash ledger used to record all ins and outs of the petty cash tin. And yes, occasionally locals came to the farm and bought a bag full of cooked crayfish. Those sales were then entered into the book and the money went into the petty cash tin. The owners knew about the cash sales and were ok with it.  &#x200B;  **CLEARING UP FALSE INFORMATION**  **Not Welcomed**  There was no animosity against Jeffrey. He was a welcomed addition to the team because he was hired to find a way to turn the failing business around. Many years of selling the large adult Crayfish and inbreeding the rest, has resulted in small sized Crays and slower growth rates too. As well as losing lots of stock to eels, birds and turtles, stock levels were on a constant decline. Hans argued over and over with the owners that eel fencing, bird netting and breeder stock were required, or the farm would not last another 2 years. There were many days that drained ponds had no stock in them but big fat eels and turtles instead. Since the owners didn’t listen to Hans, everyone was hoping that they would listen to Jeffrey, but in the end they didn’t listen to Jeffrey either as no changes were implemented. The owners simply decided to cut their losses and sell the business instead.  **In Danger**  Jeffrey was not working for or with Hans and the others. Jeffrey did his own thing when and where he wanted. He didn’t clock on or off, had no roster and no schedule. He was completely independent and didn’t share his work or results with anyone else on the farm. But he did have to follow the rules while he was on the farm just like everyone else had to. Let other know where you were going when heading out onto the farm was extremely important. That way someone can find you in case of an emergency, and since live ammunition was used on the farm, you wouldn’t get shot. On one occasion Hans almost shot Jeffrey because no one knew that Jeffrey was out on the farm. That was not a “warning shot” as Denham reported, it was Jeffreys almost getting shot by accident because he failed to follow the rule.  **The Old Gun**  Hans told the business owners that he wanted a shotgun to scare off the birds that were eating the Crayfish and to protect himself from venomous snakes. The .22 rifle that was already on the farm was no good for either situation. The owners agreed but weren’t prepared to pay much for another gun. Hans found the old shotgun at a second-hand shop and bought it for $40. The owners reimbursed him for it. That gun was made in 1901 and was starting to fall apart, but Hans didn’t have another choice.  **Fight Over The Changed Lock**  No one was to use any gun on the farm unless they held a QLD Shooters License. Jeffrey was licensed in NSW but not QLD, so when Jeffrey kept shooting the old gun, Hans changed the lock to the office, preventing Jeffrey access to the guns. Jeffrey rang the owners to protest, and they instructed Hans to change the lock back, and to let Jeffrey use the guns even though he wasn’t licensed to do so. Hans changed the lock straight away and that was the end of it.  **Jeffreys Gun**  Jeffrey showed off a shotgun to everyone in the office during one of their morning coffee breaks. Hans asked him if the owners paid for it and Jeffrey responded with a yes. Jeffrey told the owners that he wasn’t comfortable using the old gun, so they bought him his own gun. That was the only time anyone ever saw that gun. It wasn’t kept in the office with the other two guns. Jeffrey had it in his trailer that he slept in when on the farm. No one ever saw Jeffrey use that gun after that day. Jeffrey simply continued using the old gun instead. He never complained about the old gun again.  **Theft, Conspiracy and Coverup**  No one was taking and selling Crayfish from the farm. The falling stock levels were a combination of many factors, and the owners were not interested in fixing the problem. They were too busy accusing hard workers of theft instead. Once Jeffrey joined the team and saw why the stock was undersized and missing, the owners simply decided to sell the farm rather than spend the money to fix the problems.  **Secret Black Book**  There was nothing secret about the ledger book that was kept with the petty cash tin. The owners knew that locals occasionally dropped into the farm on the way past and bought 1 or 2 kilograms of cooked crayfish for cash. All sales were recorded, and the money was used as petty cash. And there were no boxes for sale, stacked at the front gate as per the Channel 7 show. The seafood wouldn’t last an hour in the sun.  **Jeffrey Feared For His Life**  If Jeffrey was telling everyone that he was in danger, why would his parent, spouse, friends, relatives or the business owners let him go back to work? And why was nothing ever said to Hans about it?  &#x200B;  **FINAL COMMENT**  Following this case right from day one, looking through everything that was published in all the media at home and round the world, absorbing everything online and reading all the comments from those who knew and loved Jeffrey and those who got caught up in this story, it breaks my heart to see so many people looking for something that does not exist. There was no foul play, no conspiracy, no ill intensions, and no one who wanted to harm Jeffrey. Please don’t torture yourselves looking for something that cannot be found.  Jeffrey Brooks did not deserve to die - may he rest in peace.",belgeselsever,zils6d

"The Family I Had Sorry to post about this doc even though there are posts in the past. But I just saw it, and have feelings about it.   The mom really was shocked by what her son did? It's inexplicable?  Paris' dad has paranoid schizophrenia symptoms. His mom Charity was off doing coke when he was 12 and Ella was 3, leaving Paris to care for Ella.   The mom martyrs herself by ""allowing contact"" between Paris and new child Phoenix... saying ""I love you"" to Paris... sounding like she's strangling. She says she forgives Paris, but rips all his letters in two. She seems much sorrier for herself than for her children.   The grandma seems proud that her dead husband was in the mafia and may have killed him. She's thrilled at her manipulativeness. The murderer son, Paris,  is diagnosed as a sociopath, but he seems the most self-aware, honest and truly repentant of the lot.   The grandmother does seem inappropriate in terms of material she sends, but the mom is in total denial about her culpability for her child's actions and continued suffering. She's all about herself, doesn't want to share or compromise, says she has no regrets, makes up stories about him, and seems to have no feeling except defensiveness. And lies just seep out of her mouth. She talks about integrity, how she has forgiven Paris, how she doesn't want to be a hypocrite. But it's clear she's fucking lying and manipulating. It's absolutely disgusting.   Even the grandma seems more reflective and prone to try to understand Paris.   Charity seems like a total narcissist with a rotation of fatherless golden children. She knows everything. None of the wrongs she has done really matter. ""Look at me. Feel bad for me. See how strong and honest I am. Look at my life, the living gravestone of my dead golden child. Observe all I've done and marvel.""  And she makes no sense. At 1:15:15 she tries to reinforce the demonization of her son ... retroactively. ""I say to people, 'If you don't believe my son is a sociopath, you just wait til he gets out of prison. He has to become a sociopath to survive.'"" So... the result of your shitty parenting prove you right, indemnifying you. I just can't with this b!tch.   At the start of the doc, I liked charity. I'm almost through, but I loathe her so much I can't finish it.",belgeselsever,fhf8s4

Say you're at school, and you know that even when you get back to your dorm, you're gonna be STRAIGHT UP BORED OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND. Eventually, you make it back and sure enough your roommate is even gone. Before I go any further I wanna highlight the fact that I am a HUGE TRUE CRIME FAN and I actually am VERY MUCH against YouTube's stupid ass ""Terms of Whatever-TH-It-Is"" policy, but that's besides the point. Either way, this was me. Either way, this crazy-ass-looking thumbnail pops up on my suggestions, and, to make matters even MORE INSANE, it was covering a murder that was supposedly inspired by one of the Saw films. I immediately viewed it and to make matters EVEN MORE NUTS, this entire channel was going to revolve around killings/death inspired by fictional media - something that is kinda of a frequent thing more so than one might think. Now I do wanna state that - while having a pretty unsettling atmosphere - It was nowhere near as disturbing as like say Plagued Moth or Shrouded Hand... It was just UNIQUE in what it was. Before anyone asks, YES, I subscribed. The icon beside the channel name, which was called ""Splatterpunk"" depicted a LITTLE RED CHARACTER WITH YELLOW/ORANGE (I can't rlly remember) AND SHARP TEETH. He kinda reminded me of the Spitfire mascot if you know who I'm talking abt. I checked within a few days later and it appears that both the videos AND channel were taken down despite its unique approach to true crime. I can't find ANYTHING ANYWHERE abt the creator NOR the channel itself. If anyone has any info, or (somehow) maybe even the video, itself, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. Thank you!",belgeselsever,1j9kzyc

Even relationships with college professors and their students, two consenting adults btw, is considered inappropriate. In what world did you think this case was different?? And the AUDACITY to get that intimate without informing the family regardless of what you ‘believed’, it’s giving ‘FISHY’. I cried when I heard the POV of the mom and brother. In our society there are three groups of people who are to be protected at all cost by society regardless of our differences, Children/Minors, people with disabilities, and senior citizens. These are very vulnerable groups of people, are an easier target for predators. And from what I saw and heard, Anna clearly overstepped and took advantage of Derrick!!

"Tell Me You Love Me (Netflix) Documentary's GLARING CONTRADICTION Did anyone else find this very odd: The doctor chosen to evaluate Derrick at trial for competency, and  intellectual capabilities was the same doctor who, years prior, made a well known documentary which debunked the whole concept of facilitated communication. I mean obviously the courts were aware of this and his stance on Facilicated Communication so that alone would be a hard Bias for him to overcome doing the evaluation.

"Jerry Springer: Fights, Camera, Action (Plz feel free to delete if this is a dupe - I searched multiple times but didn't find any existing posts!)  So - I find this doc super, super fascinating, for a variety of reasons. Would love general discussion.  This biggest thing that stands out to me, though, is how little accountability the producers take, even after all these years. I'm not talking the EP who was in charge and making the big bucks - like, the low-level producers doing the grunt work who are STILL defending the show and their choices and their role in it. In particular, how often Tony Yoshimura talks consistently about the toll it took ON HIM re: all the shit he had to do for the show, but shows no remorse for the impact HE HIMSELF had on the guests?  Idk - Overall, a fascinating case study of the human psyche. The show (as in - the Jerry Springer Show itself) gets compared to the Sanford Prison Experiment at one point and tbh that's... not far off.  \[Edit - Deleting the image - I am Reddit illiterate ha and meant for it to show up as like a ""banner"" or whatever lmao but instead it was just a sad hyperlink, womp womp\]",belgeselsever,1hw8s3c

"Netflix Documentary Recommendations Is it just me, or does Netflix have a really good way of turning documentaries and real-life stories into something that hooks you? These kinds of shows have opened our eyes to the possibility of people being inhumane and manipulative. Almost all of the shows I've watched on Netflix are documentaries. Here are some of my favorites and the best documentaries (for me) that I would recommend:   &#x200B;  1. **Unsolved Mysteries**      • Real cases of perplexing disappearances, shocking murders and paranormal      encounters fuel this gripping revival of the iconic documentary series. *(This      was the first docuseries that got me hooked.)* 2. **Worst Roommate Ever**      • Violent con artists. Stone-cold killers. These terrifying true stories      unveil some of the worst cohabitation experiences one could ever imagine. *(A      docuseries for beginners\[?\] I love the storytelling flow.)* 3. **Girl in the Picture** •      In this documentary, a woman found dying be a road leaves behind a son, a      man claiming to be her husband—and a mystery that unfolds like a      nightmare. *(I don't know about you, but these confusing facts will      forever haunt me.)* 4. **House of Secrets**      • Suicide, murder...or something else? This docuseries examines chilling      truths and theories around the deaths of 11 members of a Delhi family. *(Goosebumps!)* 5. **American Murder: The Family Next Door** • Using raw, firsthand footage, this documentary      examines the disappearance of Shanann Watts and her children, and the      terrible events that followed. 6. **Lover Stalker Killer** •      In this twisting documentary, a mechanic tries online dating for the first      time and meets a woman who takes romantic obsession to a deadly extreme *(Maaaaaan,      you'll go nuts at the end!)* 7. **American Nightmare** •      After harrowing home invasion and kidnapping in 2015, a couple is accused      of staging the ordeal when the woman reappears in this true-crime      docuseries. *(My emotions while watching were so mixed: confusion, doubts,      anger, and sadness.)* 8. **Take Care of Maya**      • In this documentary, an anguished couple in Florida battles authorities      for custody of their ailing daughter after being accused of child abuse. *(This      one is highly recommended, but not for those who easily cry! And yes, I      cried.)* 9. **Ice Cold** •      This documentary delves into the unanswered questions surrounding the      trial of Jessica Wongso—years after the death of her best friend, Mirna      Salihin. *(I'll just roll my eyes here. Best friend, my ar$e.)* 10. **Sins of our Mother**      • When Lori Vallow's kids vanished, the search for them unearthed a trail      of suspicious deaths, a new husband who shared her doomsday views—and      murder. *(Not all parents are good, apparently.)* 11. **Till Murder Do Us Part: Soering vs. Haysom** • Did Jens Soering murder his girlfriend's parents in      1985—or was she the killer? This docuseries digs into questions that still      swirl around the case. (*For those who have already watched this, what's      your opinion? I think both of them conspired to do it.)* 12. **The Devil on Tria**l      • Using reenactments and home videos, this dark documentary investigates      the apparent possession of a young boy—and the brutal murder that      followed. *(I'm sorry to the 'Conjuring' fans out there. But this      eye-opening show made me have a vindicative chuckle. Netflix made it seem      like 'oh, we've got to put here the facts but not too much as we'll be      sued.')* 13. **Bad Surgeon: Love Under the Knife** • Celebrity 'supersurgeon' Paolo Macchiarini is a      pioneer in regenerative medicine. At the height of his success, he meets      journalist Benita Alexander. *(Such poor souls! Argh!)* 14. **Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case** • This true-crime documentary investigates six shocking      deaths in the same family and the woman at the center of the unbelievable      case: Jolly Joseph. *(Some people are really good at talking and      swindling their way. It's even scarier if they befriend you first, only to      harm you in the end! That's why my introverted self could never fully      trust a person.)* 15. **Murder in a Courtroom: Indian Predator** • In 2004, a brutal predator was lynched in a      courtroom. This is the story of the community he terrorized—and the      vengeance they unleashed. *(Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.)* 16. **Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal** • Survivors reflect on the shocking boat crash that      killed vibrant teenager Mallory Beach—and the demons that haunted troubled      driver Paul Murdaugh. *(I laughed at how Netflix even showed telephone      calls from prison coming from Dad Murdaugh threatening them if this got      aired. Well, say you, Murdaugh?)* 17. **Why Did You Kill Me?**      • The line between justice and revenge blurs when a devastated family uses      social media to track down the people who killed 24-year-old Crystal      Theobald. *(I would've done the same thing, to be honest.)* 18. **The Most Hated Man on the Internet** • When her daughter's private photos and information      are posted online, a justice-seeking mother takes swift action against the      site and its popular owner. *(I love this brave mother!)* 19. **Cyber Hell: Exposing an Internet Horror** • Anonymous and exploitative, a network of online chat      rooms ran rampant with sex crimes. The hunt to take down its operators      required guts and tenacity. *(The first Korean documentary that I      watched.)* 20. **The Raincoat Killer: Chasing a Predator in Korea** • In the early 2000s, Yoo Young-chul hammered his victims      to death and cast fear across Seoul. This docuseries recounts the hunt for      a prolific killer. *(The first Korean documentary that I loved.)* 21. **Don't F\*\*k with Cats: Chasing an Internet Killer** • A shocking online video brings together a widespread      internet group of animal lovers out for justice. Their target, meanwhile,      has more horrors planned. *(Narcissism to the extreme!)* 22. **Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel** • The notorious Cecil Hotel grows in infamy when guest      Elisa Lam vanishes. From the creator of ""The Ted Bundy Tapes,"" a      dive into crime's darkest places. *(Kudos to Netflix. I thought this was      just another show-off that something spiritual was happening, but the show      also highlighted facts.)* 23. **Evil Genius: The True Story of America's Diabolical Bank      Heist** • This baffling true crime      story starts with the grisly death of a pizza man who robs a bank with a      bomb around his neck—and gets weirded from there. *(I cannot imagine the      anxiety the pizza man felt upon hearing the bomb ticking. It's truly saddening      and infuriating at the same time. These evil people deserve to be punished      more than the disease that led to their death.)* 24. **The Deepest Breath**      • Bonded by their love of freediving, a record-setting champion and a      heroic safety diver try to make history with a remarkable feat, ready to      risk it all. *(I don't even know what went wrong!)* 25. **Harley & Katya**      • From its promising beginning to a devastating end, follow the career of      Australian figure skating pair Harley Windsor and Ekaterina      Alexandrovskaya. *(There were so many things that could've been done!      Sadly, this reflects how people don't support our sports but are always      there to 'share' the honor.)*  There are still so many documentary shows on Netflix that I haven't watched or didn't really like due to the production, presentation of facts, or just the way the show was presented. Here are my top 25! I hope you like them. For those who have watched these, you can share your own theories about them. I would love to share mine too. Ciao!",belgeselsever,1bg0lrs
"Til Murder Do Us Part: Soering vs. Haysom I feel like the detectives could have tried a little harder to prove that both Soering & Haysom were at the scene. Did they talk to the room service delivery person? Driving that long of a distance, they surely had to stop for gas. Did they check the gas stations on the route? They could have asked the attendees how many people were in the car? I know it was 1985, but there were likely security cameras somewhere they could have checked. They should have asked more about their movements in DC to prove or disprove what they did. I certainly don’t want to talk badly about how they handled the case, but I ultimately think it would have been easy to prove they were both there, or they weren’t. It’s like we spent the whole documentary trying to figure out who to believe, when I don’t think either of them were telling the full truth. They were together. That’s my two cents for what it’s worth!",belgeselsever,17nmb46

"gabby petito (what i think happened) my take on the gabby petito case: brian killed her because he found out she was calling/ texting her ex. we know he was protective because of how he acted when she was hanging out with rose constantly. gabby seems like an honest girl too, so considering she was sweet and had a big heart, he probably went through her phone, got really mad, and either she told him about her plan of leaving him, or she texted her ex about it and he read it. point is, we know he wouldn’t want her to leave EVER. hence why PROBABLY before she died she called her ex. maybe he was getting really aggressive, so she called him hoping he would hear it, or brian left her in that moment alone. all we know is they were for sure together at whole foods so the time between the phone call and when we know they were together is blurry. i just have a feeling her calling her ex has something to do with brian being aggressive because of the ex and that’s what she thought needed to happen. or that’s who she was comfortable contacting about brian. then he realized what he had done after he killed her (he was prolly shocked) so he called his parents, told them, they were on the phone for an hour so they could make sure he found his way alright. that’s also when he decided he would text himself. he’s still alive, someone helped him stage his death while his parents were at home watching the news and talking to authorities and getting media attention. then when it took the cops way too long to find him, they went and “found him” because if you think about it, they put his teeth and clothes somewhere on purpose (if they helped staged his death) which means he prolly was only given enough food and water to survive on foot for so long, mind you he’s still running from the cops so he couldn’t take a lot, he needed mobility and to lay low. so they went out and “found” his body asap that way he could come home. it’s super easy to take a drug and get your teeth pulled so his teeth being there could mean absolutely nothing.   obviously this is alleged and all my opinion. what do yall think?",belgeselsever,1j27ra3
"The Indrani Mukerjea Story: Buried Truth...What a mess. This doc is almost a year old I believe, I’ve only just seen it.   lol I just need to vent about this. I mean God.   The actual fuck have I just watched.    I’m almost angry I gave it the time of day. The main suspect Indrani Mukerjea is so blatantly full of crap it’s insulting to the viewer.   She just sits there and spews utter, nonsense.    She says she never met with Sheena:  Then there’s a recorded call of her saying she did.    She, fucking, starts to explain why she didnot want to admit Sheena was her daughter.   …Then stops mid interview and says oh wait actually no no no no that never happened   I mean it’s just incredible mate.   And on top of that…she may have lied about her dad sexually assaulting her ?   DNA comes back. Confirms the body is Sheena’s. But there’s some technicalities that Indrani’s defence points out - fair enough   But then…the ppl behind the camera ask her lawyer - hey, so if you don’t believe that body is Sheena are you gonna ask for another DNA test to prove it?   “….why should the defence ask for another DNA test it’s on them to prove the guilt”   Fuck this documentary man. Filled to the brim with bullshit. Absolute waste of time.   And Vidhie at first seemed a reasonable person and as the end approached she just devolves into utter lunacy believing her mother’s crap.    She even says she’s taking her mothers side and  ***hopes*** that her mothers telling the truth. ***hopes*** - **HOPES** she didn’t kill her sister. Get. Fucked. Sideways.   There’s a moment where Indrina’s lawyer takes his glasses off and genuinely looks like his soul is leaving his body trying to keep up with her bollocks.   Then the son who claims she was a demon, then it comes out that he was messaging her sweet nothings and asking for money.   Who ARE these fucking people? It’s like they’re all parasites ? And the only one who isn’t is now dead.    All I can really decide from this **mess** of twists and lies and horseshit is that Indrani is seeing flames in the afterlife.   She never expresses sadness, she never expresses regret, she talks about spending 6 years in prison like she’s Nelson Mandela  She wants to rename her justiceforSheena WhatsApp group to JusticeforIndrina because she feels betrayed by Sheena, the daughter that she told to lie and call her sister.    And had the nerve to say she’s manipulative and all this.   When she goes on a rant about ‘really feeling free now’ it was like a monster talking directly to the screen.    Disgusting. Absolute psycho.",belgeselsever,1icf0rb
"The Long Island Serial Killer I watched Gone Girls: The Long Island Serial Killer on Netflix yesterday and I had high hopes, but honestly, it felt half-baked and rushed, like it wasn’t ready to hit the screen.  Netflix nailed the visuals as usual (great video quality and imagery), but the story itself? Full of holes. They barely scratched the surface on the police corruption angle, which could’ve been a goldmine. And the murders? No real details or even hypothetical scenarios to paint a picture of what might’ve happened, just vague mentions that left me guessing. Then there’s that bizarre interview with the Frenchman. Who was he? Why was he talking to the killer? When did this even happen? No context at all. They hinted at the killer’s possible personality disorders but didn’t bother bringing in a psychiatrist to break it down. So many loose ends and missed opportunities. The whole thing felt scattered, like they didn’t have the glue to tie it together. Maybe it’s because they caught him recently and the trial hasn’t started, but it left me confused and underwhelmed. Am I alone here, or did anyone else feel like this was a swing and a miss?",belgeselsever,1joobah

"Cried a river watching this. TW: R@pe and abuse.     I just finished this documentary on netflix titled To kill a tiger about an Indian family's journey to help fight criminal case against the r@pe and abuse of her daughter. As an Indian with absent father, this documentary holds so much meaning and depth. It shows really how hard it is to change the Indian mindset in rural or even morden areas about r@pe, how triggering all of it is but also not totally impossible. What I greatly admire was how it was the father of the survivor who stood for her all the time, never backed down even once and always respected every decision she had. It's hard because even the most educated parents sometimes don't understand their child enough but he loved her so much. This documentary is probably very personal to me because all I ever wanted was my dad's understanding and love. It just made me cry so much.

The ones I really enjoyed (and would recommend to those who *haven't* already watched):  •Escaping Twin Flames    •Keep Sweet: pray and obey   •The Program  •Can I tell you a secret?  •Trainwreck: Woodstock '99    The ones I abandoned:  •Jimmy Savile: a British horror story  •Waco: American Apocalypse   •Wild wild country     I feel that the ones I enjoyed just have a more gripping pace and I'm looking for shows to match those. I've also watched Tiger King and Depp v. Heard but I didn't want to recommend them as they were both very popular already",belgeselsever,1bn2150

"JonBenet Ramsey:: Thoughts after watching this documentary I am not American but this tragedy was broadcast in South Africa (my home country), when it happened. I've followed the story on and off over the years. My opinion was that someone in the house did it... until I saw this documentary - my perception has changed totally. The Ramseys had to deal with so much media attention they didn't deserve - kinda like the Menendes brothers, who I believe, are in fact guilty.  The Boulder Police mishandled this case terribly from the beginning and they all played the Media to perfection - allowing the media to build their own version of the story without actually giving them any facts.  John Ramsey has lost so many people - My heart breaks for him.",belgeselsever,1hx9m8v

"Did Christi Gibbons Kill Her Husband? My Theory Based on Her Own Words- Ashley Madison I can’t stop thinking about Christi Gibbons’ account in the Ashley Madison documentary. After hearing her version of events and analyzing her demeanor, I’m convinced there’s more to the story—and I think she might have killed her husband.  Here’s what she says happened:  1. She wakes up and finds her husband, John, in the kitchen. They chat over coffee, make plans for dinner, and then she heads to work.   2. That evening, she comes home and meets a friend in the driveway. They hear a noise coming from inside, which the friend mistakes for a phone ringing.   3. The friend leaves, and Christi goes inside. She notices John isn’t in the kitchen and begins looking for him throughout the house.   4. She goes upstairs to check their bedroom, doesn’t find him, and finally heads to the garage. That’s where she finds John’s body and realizes the sound they heard was a carbon monoxide alarm going off.    On the surface, it might seem tragic and straightforward, but her story just doesn’t hold up.  Here’s why I think Christi is lying:  Why Go Upstairs First? If a carbon monoxide alarm is blaring, it’s loud, urgent, and impossible to ignore. You wouldn’t waste time wandering upstairs to look for someone—you’d immediately check the source of the noise. Her actions suggest she already knew what she’d find in the garage and was stalling. Especially if her friend heard it from the front driveway.   The Convenient Alibi: The friend in the driveway feels too perfect. Christi establishes that someone else was there to hear the sound and see her come home, reinforcing her timeline and making it seem like she had no idea what was going on.   Her Demeanor: In the documentary, Christi’s body language is unsettling. She almost never blinks, except when she's finally done recounting find Johns body- then she starts blinking like crazy which is a common indicaton of deceit. she sways back and forth, looking in all directions as if trying to comfort herself  and the errie half-smiles she tries to cover up are absolutely terrifying.   Her Statement About Cheaters: At one point, she says, “I don’t have the right to punish cheaters.” That line is so strange and defensive, almost like she’s trying to justify something to herself. Why even bring that up unless she feels guilty about taking matters into her own hands?  The Timing: John dies six days after the Ashley Madison leak exposes him as a cheating pastor. Sure, he might have felt shame, but it’s also the perfect storm for someone angry and humiliated—like Christi—to take revenge.  My theory: Christi came home earlier than she claims, confronted John about the leak, and things escalated. Maybe it was a spur-of-the-moment decision, or if she gave him sedatives but it all seems way too convenient and pristine, like the friend showing up? A well-timed way to create an alibi.  Her story feels rehearsed, and the cracks are impossible to ignore. Everything about this screams guilt. It's worth a rewatch if you've seen it already. Crazy to think about.",belgeselsever,1i1xs80
"Are Netflix Cult Docus just bad/shallow or do they know what they do? I'm watching the Rael doc atm. First episode is kinda hey thats the Eden he wanted to build and it was kinda cool tbh. All good they are painting a picture of the Utopia. But then in the next episode they let it start with him saying something totally unhinged. But they only let the still Cult people talk about how bad that felt and how not true that is (sure bro). Facts like the accuser in the studio (that they named) are not mentiond anymore, the fact that people of the group get arrested is a sidenote. Do they confront the Old Man himself with what he said? No. Then they build up a narativ that they had to flee from religious persecution and are the victim in all this.     Do they intentionally trivialize Cults (its not the first doc that is like that) Or is it just that they dont have the time to do a real Doc so they just make a shallow bad Doc?",belgeselsever,1ao4xn4

Unleashing the Eye of the Tiger: My Explosive Review of Netflix's 'Sly' Documentary! 🥊🎬 #SylvesterStallone #NetflixReview ,belgeselsever,17zw8fg
"""I killed my dad "" Is it just me or are Netflix ""documentaries"" SUPER BIASED towards the ""victim"".  I just watched I killed my dad and I feel anyone with a little common sense knows that guy committed premeditated murder.   1. His mother looked late 60's.  Either she was old 50-ish when she had him.  Menopause. Or she used a LOT of drugs.  2. He was abused for 18 years but it wasn't reported once?  Not likely.  CPS takes your kid if you feed them a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without documented proof they're not allergic to peanut butter.  3. Anthony specifically said the only place in or out of the house without a camera is the main bedroom.  He shot him outside the bedroom.  The entire house was under surveillance but captured nothing?  Not even audio? 4. Burt carried a loaded gun 24/7.  Except that one very specific time?  But kept not one but two loaded revolvers in his closet? 5. Crime scene photos.  You're telling me a 17 year old kid with no social skills and no intellect left his cell phone and called the police with a landlines?  Or if else whose phone was that? 6. This kid that is secreted away from the world for his entire life without interaction from the outside world is allowed a cell phone and social media accounts.  His ""mom"" said she found him on social media.  But he was ""controlled"" to an abused state? 7. The way Anthony talked in the interrogation vice when he talked during the ""documentary"".  There's no way he became that sociable or that articulate in a matter of one to two years.  Not at that age.  8. Watch him as he interacts with his mom at the end of the last episode.  He's trying to avoid eye contact with the camera.  But he looks and it's not an awkward look.  He's expecting validation.  His eye contact is meaningful.  Sorry this is so long but Netflix needs to stop victimized criminals.  Above is what's wrong with society.  Everyone is a victim.  No one does wrong except those that can't speak for themselves.",belgeselsever,15ttua7

"Why Marvin Harrison Might Be the Most Overlooked Receiver in NFL History From 1999 to 2003, Marvin Harrison averaged 117 catches, 1,580 yards, and 14 touchdowns *per season*. That five-year stretch remains one of the most dominant in NFL history — and yet, when we talk about the greatest receivers of all time, his name often gets left out of the conversation.  I put together this video breaking down his peak years, comparing him directly to legends like Jerry Rice and Randy Moss, and diving into the advanced metrics that show just how efficient and consistent Harrison truly was.  📽️ **Watch it here**: [  It’s a deep dive — full of stats, context, and film — that makes the case for Harrison as one of the most technically perfect and quietly dominant receivers to ever play the game.

"[Discussion] Connections between ""That Magic Moment"" and other 30 for 30's. As a fan of the 30 for 30 films (as I'm sure many of you are), I couldn't help but notice how many other 30 for 30 films are tied into the latest one, ""That Magic Moment""  I Hate Christian Laettner: Shaq talks about thinking Laettner could be drafted #1 instead of him.  The Fab Five: The Magic drafting Chris Webber, but then trading for Penny Hardaway.  Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs. The New York Knicks: Magic got swept by Reggie Miller and the Pacers in the '94 playoffs.  Jordan Rides the Bus: The film talks about MJ leaving baseball and then coming back for the '95 playoffs.  Once Brothers: They mention the Lakers trading away Vlade Divac to make room to sign Shaq. Another slight connection: Drazen Petrovic was on the floor when Shaq broke the basket in New Jersey.   No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson, June 17th, 1994, and Bad Boys also took place around the same time, but I didn't really see connections to them in this film.  Maybe ESPN has overdone it on films about basketball in the 90's, but I think it's cool that there are these threads that tie a lot of the stories together.",belgeselsever,4f74k3

"Looking for an old baseball doc called (maybe) HARDBALL that was hilarious behind the scenes stories. Back in the late 80's/early 90's there used to be a baseball documentary that would air during rain delays. I think it was called HARDBALL, and the subtitle may have been ""An inside look at ...""  It was a documentary about bizarre incidents and dirty tricks from the history of baseball. I remember that Bobby Bonds, Ken Griffey, Sr and Dock Ellis were among the talking heads, along with some sports execs and media guys.  AND IT WAS HILARIOUS!  Two stories in particular that I remember:  Dock Ellis hitting the first 5 or 7 guys in the Cincy Reds lineup to open the game before getting thrown out. He said he was pissed about something, and he was just going to keep hitting guys until they threw him out.  A great story about Jackie Robinson getting back at Enos Slaughter for spiking him. They said Jackie waited two years to do it. While Slaughter was trying to steal second, Jackie took the throw and, when Slaughter slid, Jackie took the ball and put it in Slaughter's mouth, knocking out a bunch of teeth.  I have no idea how true the stories they told were, but I about pissed myself when they cut to Dock Ellis, eyes popping, and he said, ""If I saw Enos Slaughter today, I'D TRY TO KILL HIM!!!!!""  Every few years I search the internet for this documentary, and so far I have never found even a hint that it ever existed. Google produces a giant zero no matter what search terms I use, and no matter how many pages deep I go.  Anyone know about this? Does anyone know where it can be found?",belgeselsever,8d88aq

"Help me find this YouTube documentary 🙏 Hey everyone.   I (32) remember watching a documentary type video on YouTube when I was about 15 years old. But I can’t remember what’s it’s called or too many details.   What I do remember: It told the story of a young British man who went to the Middle East to join some type of revolution or religion. It’s POV is from his mom and family. His mom and family say he’s run off to join a terrorist group. They say he and his wife converted to Islam or some other religion popular in the Middle East.  I believe in the end he dies. Its angle is very much “why young men are going to the Middle East to join terrorist.”  Now that I am older, I feel that the documentary was probably very misleading and I wanted to rewatch it to see it with adult eyes and with the knowledge I now know of European imperialism.   But I don’t know where to find it. Does any of this sound familiar to you?",belgeselsever,1kobgoq

No outside funding. No fancy branding. Just constant reinvestment, relentless iteration, and a deep respect for creators. Today, RØDE is used in Hollywood productions, YouTube studios, and podcasts around the world.  I actually turned this into a short documentary—if anyone’s curious, I’m happy to share it.",belgeselsever,1knwkab

"I found a company with a fascinating story and felt I had to document it… Hey everyone, I recently went down a rabbit hole researching a company called Iron Mountain—a business that started as a mushroom farm in an old mine and somehow ended up storing the secrets of Fortune 500 companies and even the U.S. government.  As I dug deeper, I found a gripping story: it starts with one man trying to rescue Jewish refugees during WWII, and ends with a global enterprise trusted by Wall Street. The twists, the business pivots, and the lessons on resilience—it felt like a documentary waiting to be made.  So I made one.

The police did nothing besides trying to pin this on the parents - and they were wrong.  3. This girl was murdered in such a violent way, it makes one’s stomach turn upside down.

"How the US is Profiting from Poverty Hi everyone,   I’m starting a YouTube channel that dives into **finance topics in a way that’s thought-provoking, cinematic, and entertaining**. My goal is to make financial concepts engaging, not boring, while exploring systems, stories, and strategies that shape the world around us. Think of it as a mix of James Jani’s cinematic flair and Jake Tran’s edgy narratives.  For my first video, I want to explore the topic: **""How the US is Profiting from Poverty.""**  The idea is to uncover how poverty isn’t just a social issue—it’s a business model. I plan to highlight systems like **payday loans**, which trap people in cycles of debt, and reveal **who actually profits** from keeping people poor (hint: it’s not just the payday lenders—banks and corporations are involved too).  Here’s the rough angle I’m thinking:  1. Start by placing the viewer in the shoes of someone living paycheck to paycheck. 2. Gradually reveal how payday loans work and why they exist. 3. Twist the story by showing **""who wins""**—banks funding these companies and corporations relying on low wages. 4. Expand into the larger question: *How do all these systems interconnect to keep poverty profitable?*  What do you think of this angle? Is there a specific part of the story you’d want to see explored more?   I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially if you think there’s a more impactful way to frame this topic.  Thanks in advance! 🙌",belgeselsever,1h8ebhu

"Documentary Review - Sweet Bobby: My Catfish Nightmare   Sweet Bobby: My Catfish Nightmare - 8/10. I think its fairly easy to brush off this story and say “why didn’t the person clue in to the fact they never showed their face?” Or, “how could she have not known for nearly 10 years?” Or, “how can someone be so naive and oblivious to the signs?” To that I say: its easier said than done. I felt empathy for this person, and I know how the same internet that the catfisher used to play with her life, would be the same internet that might be critical of her story. After watching this doc, I felt sick to my stomach, and felt depressed. Its a tough story to share, and one that I’m glad that they shared. The idea of catfishing is a disturbing concept: why the hell would one do this action and deed? What is really the point? The sad thing is, the person preyed on this individual’s situation of wanting a partner, of finding love post a bad relationship. And for some people in love, they just want to feel being loved and being cared for. The sad thing is, it seems like this person brushed all of the red flags aside just to feel that happiness and love. And its unfortunate that the person lost a portion of their life due to this, but I’m glad that they have taken the situation and are doing things to right the wrongs that were done against her.

"A Dangerous Son I hated this documentary. I wanted to like it and I wanted to feel bad for these families. Maybe it's the film style but honestly, everything about it upset me.  1st and foremost the first mother allowed for her daughter to go through abuse by her brother. That poor girl- whether her brother is ill or not should never have to go through it. For Christ sake she could of easily asked her sister to take her daughter for some time and allow for the son to get better at home treatment or a plan. Especially knowing that he's held a gun to her and she has to give in to him out of safety. All she does is positively reinforce the behavior.  Second, I get I'm in an area which is really positive in mental health and disability care. I have my background in ABA. I have my BCBA, but the fact that these states have limited access doesn't actually seem correct to me- I know space is limited but quite frankly I think these families don't want to go through a full behavior modification process. The son who they placed in care was the only family as an entity I found myself routing for as they did the proper procedures. But the fact they called cops over a behavior instead of just enforcing your choice and then saying ""it's a behavioral symptom""... well no shit. But if these parents didn't want to feel like bad parents (NOT SAYING THEY ARE) they should really learn and enforce what works for their child in a modified setting.  Third- why the HELL if these people are scared of their kids allowing them to have toy guns and or literal real guns in their house?! Like the hell!!!!",belgeselsever,1fr0yif

"Documentary Review - Martha   Martha - 8/10. Its so strange seeing Martha, because I feel like I’ve known her career. My mom was a big Martha Stewart fan, and she would watch her show whenever I would come home from school for lunch or after school’s done. A lot of products at our house were Martha products. And then, the jail sentence happened. And then, the Bieber roast happened. And from that, the Martha renaissance began. I really love how she has just embraced and gone about the way in her career to now where she seems more focused on her own happiness and wants in terms of success. She’s not allowing others to dictate what she should do, and I think that’s why she became famous through her company in the first place. She’s such a fascinating and interesting individual. She’s had so much success, so much controversy, and has had multiple images that the public had been used to. But what I appreciate a lot about this doc is that Martha is unapologetically herself. She never seems to shy away from her frank nature and her ability to inspire people. She wants the best out of things and people, and though some people might misconstrue that as being bossy, I just view it as a person who is determined to make the most out of life and getting the most out of life for the average consumer so they can feel a part of her vision and wishes. This is a standard biopic documentary, and though it might follow the standard formula, it still offers up interesting tidbits and insight into herself and her career.",belgeselsever,1gjoni5

"[Review] How Beer Saved the World s01e01 [How Beer Saved The World]( is a humor/satire documentary that sets out to highlight the importance of beer in the course of world history.   I'm not against humorous documentaries--the ones that Terry Jones does are fantastic. However I am against documentaries which have bad history in them, and this one is absolutely *full* of bad history.   There are some cool bits of information (I knew that the Egyptians were paid in beer, I didn't know about the tetracycline or the beer bottle machine), but overall the tone is off-putting and the bad history makes watching the rest of the episodes not worthwhile.   **Rating**: 2 out of 5 stars (you're better off getting drunk and watching some sports).  To be fair to the type of documentary that this is, I'm going to ignore any bad history that's a result of massive over-generalization (or at least not dock it too much). That's a kind of given with this sort of thing.   During the course of the documentary the path of history is traced from ancient times through modern times, highlighting the key role of beer in each stage.  **How Beer Saved the World ep 1**  *How Beer Saved the World* is obviously meant to be a humorous documentary, and the tone definitely matches that desire. The humor is over the top as is the narrator who reminds me of Movie Voice Over Guy.  The claims in the first episode are very much hyperbole and over the top, as well as being full of bad history.   1.) Agriculture was because of beer.  9,000 B.C. birth of farming in the Middle East. 1st Civilization Mesopotamia. Docu claims this was because of the desire to cultivate grains for beer. The claim is that beer was brewed long before bread baking. There's archaelogical evidence for flour that dates back to 30,000 years ago and there's evidence of bread consumption going back to 10,000 years ago. It also ignores other non-Mesopotamian cultures.  Beer is at **least** 1000 years younger than bread.   2.) Pyramids were because of beer. This isn't too egregious of an error. The pyramid builders *were* paid in beer and almost everybody in ancient Egypt did drink beer (though my understanding is that it wasn't really a drink--more of a gruel). However the pyramids would still have been built even if there was no beer, and Egypt isn't the biggest ancient civilization of them all (as the documentary claims).    3.) Beer established modern health care.  There are three things that the documentary uses to back this up. The first is that ancient Egyptian beer contained tetracycline which is a powerful antibiotic. The second is that beer saved millions of people in the Middle Ages because the brewing process killed bacteria, and thirdly Pasteur was working on fermentation issues when he discovered bacteria, and modern medicine is built on that.  While one and two are true, I'm not sure how they make beer the founder of modern medicine. Three is also true (though it was actually wine that Pasteur worked on, not beer), but modern medicine was in it's infancy before then. In addition the documentary claims that before Pasteur nobody knew about germs, which while technically true misses the broader picture which is that people had been speculating about it long before.   4.) Medieval period.  Everybody drank. People went to church because they were promised beer afterward. Beer Brewing was the critical factor in the growth of the Medieval economy and led to our modern financial institutions and led to the creation of trade, commerce, banking, and finance.  5.) Beer shaped America.  Beer allowed the Mayflower travelers to get to America safely and they only landed in Plymouth Bay because they ran out of beer (exaggeration). Boston Tea Party came about because a bunch of Patriots were hanging out in a bar and getting shit-faced and then decided to go do something about the situation. This kicked off the American Revolution.  The first statement is more or less true (though a vast simplification). The second true is an out and out fabrication. The Boston Tea Party was a well-organized event that began after a lengthy speech. The Tea Partiers were very careful to not destroy anything that *wasn't* tea, and the Tea Party did not lead directly to the Revolution.    6.) Beer invented refrigeration. Brewing industry financed the invention of refrigeration technology.  This much is true.  7.) Beer invented mass production.  The first mass production machine was a beer bottle machine. As a result it wiped out child labor because of the automation and because the glass industry was the largest employer of child labor in the country.   The first statement is true. The second one is a massive generalization.",belgeselsever,1ldb5c

"[Review] Weapons That Made Britain s01e01 - The Sword **Title:** [Weapons That Made Britain: Swords](  **Summary:** Noted weapons expert Mike Loades takes on five of the iconic weapons that made Britain. Along the way he busts a few myths and demonstrates their practical use in medieval warfare.  **Running Time:** 46:43  **Rating:** 9/10 stars  **TL,DR**  A fantastic documentary for anyone who's looking to acquire a basic understanding of the history and use of the sword in medieval Britain. Most of the information in the documentary won't be new to a Medieval enthusiast, but there are some highlights that make it worthwhile for any Medieval enthusiast. In addition Mike Loades' enthusiasm and love for the subject are clear and he does a fantastic job in conveying that enthusiasm to his audience.  **Detailed Review**  I have a small confession to make. I think that Mike Loades can do no wrong. (OK, I really **don't** think that, but it's not far off the truth). When it comes to medieval weapons and tactics he's probably my favorite presenter of all time. (As a side note I *highly* recommend his book *Swords and Swordsmen*.) In this documentary series Mike Loades takes on four iconic weapons and does a fair job of de-mystifying them.  In the first episode of this five part series Mike Loades takes a look at the Medieval sword. The opening moments of the documentary show him doing some choreographed fighting whilst talking about the romanticized nature of the sword in history, at which point he informs us that on the battlefield the medieval sword was a powerful and visceral weapon.  Loades discusses a couple of different types of swords in the context of the [Battle of Barnet]( He also demonstrates the various parts of the sword as well as showing the versatility of the sword and the characteristics of a good sword.  The next segment shows him demonstrating 15th century sword technique to some of his students. This part I thoroughly enjoyed because of the debunking of the notion that a sword was nothing but a heavy club, and that swordsmen weren't just out there flailing around at each other with no technique--that there was a vibrant martial arts built around the use of the sword. He manages to do all of this without actually saying anything about the myths--just through practical application.   The next segment is a brief summary of the Wars of the Roses up until the [Battle of Barnet]( and then cuts back to the students and their instruction. This is the format that's used for most of the rest of the documentary. Loades will discuss the historical/tactical background of the subject (battle, bladesmithing, fighting techniques, etc.), then will cut to the classroom (which is really the students in what appears to be an unused stable/riding ground), and then back.  Loades also spends some time talking about the history and mythos of the sword and why it was still vitally important on a 15th century battlefield. As with the swordfighting techniques, this is demonstrated through practical application as he relies on expert bladesmith [Hector Cole]( to forge a sword.   Loades also spends some time with artifacts. We get to see a medieval sword in remarkably good condition as well as medieval fight manuscripts, including a copy of the Tallehoffer manuscript.   The conclusion of the documentary consists of a bit of re-enactment with his students. One of the things that surprised me the first time I saw this documentary (although on reflection I shouldn't have been surprising) is the recognition that it would have been physically very unlikely for a medieval soldier to actually fight solid for the several hours recorded, and that the battle must have consisted of some sort of break or relay system.  Livery & Maintenance was also a new term to me.",belgeselsever,1lnm3o

"Here's my short documentary film on Salt Extraction How do we get Sea Salt. I've made a short documentary film in my locality- Goa. Focusing on the current scenario of this traditional occupation. Click on the link to watch it on YouTube  Since aeons, when mankind learned to cook with salt, salt extraction has become a livelihood for many people. Food is insipid without salt, it is the most important ingredient in cooking. Many fights occur in families due to less or more of salt in food. In almost all the coastal states of India, sea salt extraction is next to fishing for locals.  Goa is one among them which is currently renowned for tourism, and this traditional occupation here is in decline. Once, this trade played a vital role in the economy of Goa which was practised by a few communities. But today, this occupation is surviving only because of the concerted efforts of people in some villages.  Salt pans, locally known as Mithagar or Mithache agor are ponds used for collecting sea water where the salt is retrieved after the process of natural evaporation. Extraction is the oldest means of salt harvesting. The process is simple but extremely exhausting and requires daily work for about 5 to 6 months.   The salt harvested in the beginning for a month contains impurities of mud and clay due to which it is mostly used as manure or as a termite repellent for coconut trees. The salt extracted after that is the white salt, used for consumption.  Even though locals prefer using indigenously prepared salt, there is competition from industrially produced iodized salt, mainly because it is difficult to cope up with the rising demand.   With very few, willing to take this up as a profession due to low income and lack of local labourers, we have seen a reduction in the number of salt pans in Goa, in recent years.",belgeselsever,vb9rm4

"[Review] Side By Side (2012) Side By Side is a documentary about the rise of digital cinema as compared to the traditional use of 35mm film. It's available on Netflix Instant.  **Rating:** **8.5 out of 10 stars.** I'd recommend this to anyone interested in trends in cinema technology, though sadly the digital cinema industry is changing so rapidly that this movie will probably be outdated in five years and certainly in ten.   Keanu Reeves narrates the film (Chris Kenneally directs), splicing voiceover with interviews. He talks to a very wide range of directors, cinematographers, and producers. I found the interviews to be done very well. The editing is superb, never leaving you in doubt about the context of a certain quote. The interviews are also pleasingly shot, occasionally showing a point of view looking at the production of the interview itself. For example, a 3/4 view showing Reeves, Christopher Nolan, and the cameraman filming the interview. A neat little touch that I thought was nice.   The film is broken up into a few segments, mostly in chronological order of the history of cinema. Aspects of filmmaking such as editing, visual effects, color grading, and distribution are all covered, first on the film side then on the digital side. For instance, Reeves discusses the early process of editing celluloid (accompanied with archival footage, *Man with a Movie Camera*, etc), then has a couple of interviewees talk about their experience editing with film, then goes over the revolutionary Editdroid system which paved the way for modern digital video editing.   Film vs digital is a debate that ignites passions in the filmmaking world, and Kenneally is careful to cover such a wide range of opinions as to let the viewer decide for themselves which is better. I suppose his point is to demonstrate that great art can be made on both formats.  I said earlier that the digital cinema industry is changing. The film goes over early digital cinema by directors such as Lars von Trier at the beginning of last decade. These were movies made on now-primitive tape cameras, and they will never exist in a stunning high-definition remaster because they were originally shot in low quality. But digital cameras improve in leaps and bounds. The most advanced camera they discuss in the movie is the RED Epic, which was released in 2011. Its successor, the Dragon, is only hinted at in the film (on a T-shirt at a convention) and improves over the Epic substantially. 3D filmmaking is given a brief overview, but the Hobbit (a pioneer in the field) is not discussed. If this documentary had been made three years ago, the opinions of the directors would have been much more strongly biased toward film as opposed to digital. We'll likely see a stronger shift in the opposite direction in the coming years.  I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about film history, and I found no glaring inaccuracies or oversimplifications in the film. (There is a diagram showing how a lens works, and they neglect to mention that the image is upside down when projected). I learned a couple of new things myself, and I consider this a fine documentary.",belgeselsever,1ldyra

Just published a review of [The Encampments]( a newly released documentary about the Columbia University student protests against the genocide in Palestine. This piece offers media criticism that situates the film as a record of events and a strategic cultural artifact embedded in the movement itself. It explores the documentary’s political function, its role in amplifying the case of Mahmoud Khalil (a student organizer now facing deportation), and its place within a broader legacy of student resistance.

"How to find journalist/truth-seeking docs versus PR/paint-by-numbers/pablum? I really love dense documentaries that seem to have taken a long time to create, stories are told artfully, have surprises, and seek truth.  How do I find documentaries like that rather than waste my time with stuff that's really just overblown, rehashed bores?  A prime example of this, to me, Is OJ Made in America versus the new Netflix doc ""OJ Simpson American Manhunt""  Made in America was AMAZING--and ""American Manhunt"" seemed to be this paint-by-numbers rehash with nothing new to say about society or the facts of the story.  [The NYT's ""The Daily"" Podcast had a great show this past Friday]( about the Prince Netflix documentary we'll never see.  The podcast made the larger point that Netflix has shifted away from dense, artsy, investigative docs like Icarus and drifted to more PR-produced products--and the sad part is it's more profitable and the overall audience doesn't seem to mind.  So how do I find great, truth-seeking docs with revelations?

"Seeking Help to Identify a Haunting Documentary about War Crimes - Journalist Investigates WWII and Serbian Atrocities Hello everyone,   I've been trying to find a documentary that has left a lasting impact on me, and I'm hoping this community might be able to help. It aired on SBS in Australia around 2016-2018. The documentary is centered on a British journalist's investigation into two specific photographs:   A photo of Serbian or Bosnian armed men, possibly militia or military, standing over the bodies of women and children.   A photo of a German WWII officer with a clipboard, overseeing a mass grave where a bulldozer is pushing bodies into the grave.   The journalist delves deep into the histories behind these photographs, eventually tracking down the men in the first photo and the German officer in the second. The interviews explore how they ended up in those situations and the human nature aspect of their actions.   This documentary is unique in its focus on the investigation of specific historical photographs and the stories behind them. Any information about this documentary, its title, director, or any leads on how to find it would be immensely appreciated. It's a piece that has haunted me for years, and I'm earnestly looking to revisit its profound narrative.   Thank you all in advance for your help!",belgeselsever,1aen1l2
"How long should a documentary be? I’m curious about watching “The Curious Case of Natalia Grace”. I’m a documentary nut. I love all kinds. But if I find one that I might want to check out and see that it’s multiple episodes and multiple seasons, I completely lose interest. This one for example is 2 seasons with 6+ episodes each. I mean ya, there could be a lot to talk about but still! Shows like Planet Earth can be multiple episodes because they talk about different things in each episode. This show is just about this girls life, why drag it on thru multiple episodes/seasons. Maybe it’s my ADD but 12+ hours on a show, it’s gotta be worth it. Life is too short to spend watching mediocre tv haha. The sweet spot time frame for docs is 3-4 episodes MAX or have it be a movie 1-2hrs long.

"Ross McElwee’s Six O'clock News If people recognize Ross McElwee’s name they are likely to associate it with his much acclaimed documentary *Sherman’s March*. Its on most lists of the best documentaries and on several lists of the best films. It is indeed a great film but it is one among several equally great films made by McElwee. His films can be seen as one long documentary where each installment is as good as the next. They are a document of McElwee’s life blended with his questions about existence. *Sherman’s March* does a good job exemplifying his approach to filmmaking but I personally am most fascinated by his documentary titled*The Six O’clock News*.  *The Six O’clock News* was his eighth film. He made it in 1996. It spans at least four years of his life. It has several themes and ideas that weave through it but the central subject is control. He examines his lack of control over his subjects as opposed to a fiction film director who has completely control. He examines the concepts or fate, destiny and god and how there are those who feel that their lives are controlled by these forces. He examines the camera itself as means of control as well as the news media and television in general. He sort of free associates between all of these aspects and allows them to inform each other. His meditations may feel disordered but they are thorough and substantive.  McElwee is able to see the world through a lens of control and see aspects of this idea in all of his experiences. He sees it with his wife and child, with his oddball landlord, in church, on tv and in his Harvard classroom where he teaches. The breadth of his vision is itself a result of his not being in control. Wherever his investigation takes him he spontaneously follows. He ends up interviewing firefighters in Yosemite, Evangelicals in a trailer park in Arizona, A survivor of a horrible earthquake in LA, a producer trying to hire him for a film and many more. McElwee is wide open to what the world brings him. He is friendly and inquisitive and seemingly willing to spend time talking with anyone, including a drunken homeless man who accosts him on the Santa Monica Pier.  One of the both endearing and frustrating aspects of McElwee is that he never puts his camera down. Its always on his shoulder, always rolling through birthdays, family arguments, or a walk down the street. All of his documentaries are assembled from hours of footage taken of his life. He even films himself filming. He leaves no stone unturned when it comes to exploring the facets of what he is doing and how it effects him, his subjects as well as his viewers. Its deeply philosophical but it never seems academic or removed from the concrete reality of what is in front of him.  There is a scene in which a local television news crew come to visit him because of his reputation as “the man who is always filming himself.” The team films him as he films them. They jockey for the best shooting position and light. The correspondent interviews him with her microphone and McElwee narrates through a voice over. Again he takes the political commentary he is making about the news and its ability to control its viewers and subjects and makes it personal and direct. He recognizes that he is unable to come up with a “soundbite” and so struggles to give the correspondent what she wants.   McElwee’s films all have a wry sense of humor, but they are tempered with self-deprecation. He isn’t bitter, but he can be biting. The bulk of the Six O’clock News is McElwee interviewing people who have had an experience with disaster. In particular an experience which caused them to be on the nightly news. McElwee explores the nature of mediation, the changes that occur as reality is translated into film. His landlord is obsessed with television and ends up turning himself into a hybrid of man and machine in order to impress the visiting news crew. McElwee sees the humor in it but he also sees the layers that reveal how cameras control both the viewer and the viewed. Later he films a woman being interviewed by a news crew and then films her watching herself on tv. He notes not only the effect of the news’ crews footage on the woman but also of his own footage of her watching herself. He never leaves his participation in the manipulation unexamined.  In the opening of The Six OcLock News we see his infant son fussing on a bad. McElwee’s first line of narration is “This is my son Adrian. He seems a little perplexed by me or maybe its just my movie camera.” McElwee immediately draws attention to the fact that we do not see a baby on a bed, we see a film, shot by a filmmaker of a baby in a bed.   All of this is encapsulated in the somewhat goofy persona of McEllwee. In fact I find it hard to keep calling him by his last name. By the time you finish watching a few of his documentaries he is like a friend or a weird uncle. He’s a little bit hapless, a little bit of a nerd but it all contributes to his being a kind of outsider looking in at a world he finds confusing and captivating. To share his point of view is to share his curiosity about the world and how we construct meaningful stories about our experiences in it.",belgeselsever,f3xg68
"New Raoul Peck Documentary – Ernest Cole: Lost and Found – A Powerful Look at Apartheid Through Photography If you’re a fan of Raoul Peck’s work (*I Am Not Your Negro*, *Lumumba*), his latest documentary, *Ernest Cole: Lost and Found*, is a must-watch.

"Documentary Review - My Radio My Life I watched a beautiful documentary yesterday. I thought of sharing the experience.   ""[My Radio My Life]( wasn't just a documentary, it was a wave of nostalgia that transported me back to a simpler time. The film's exploration of radio's golden age wasn't just historical, it was deeply personal. Each individual featured, like the seasoned announcer recounting the Apollo 11 landing, or the passionate radio museum curator, brought to life the emotional connection many have with this unique medium.   Hearing the announcer describe the moon landing sent shivers down my spine. His voice, heavy with the weight of history, painted a vivid picture of that momentous occasion. It wasn't just about technology, it was about human achievement, and the radio served as a powerful link, uniting listeners like myself to that historic moment.   The radio museum curator's dedication was equally inspiring. Seeing their devotion to preserving this slice of history, the countless knobs, dials, and wooden cabinets, brought back a sense of wonder and appreciation for the technology that once held such power over our imaginations.   ""My Radio My Life"" left me with a warm, fuzzy feeling. It reminded me of the power of human connection, the thrill of discovery, and the enduring magic of radio, a medium that may have transformed over time, but continues to hold a special place in the hearts of many.",belgeselsever,1b3od3i

"Searching for a documentary seen a few years ago Hi everyone. As the title says, I hope I can find some help from you with a documentary I watched roughly five years ago.  Here are details which I remember:  **The plot:** It was roughly about spirituality/consciousness. The main focus on it tho was the interesting part - it was about a Hindu/eastern concept of being ""woke,"" for lack of a better word, which had a name, and it mentioned that the more you try to chase that ""wokeness"" the less you actually get to it. It mentioned that you get to that place just by living basically. It also touched on the idea that the people that were ""woke"" (from the Hindu perspective) had to hide it in a way since the others didn't understand it and needed to continue playing their normal role in society even tho they were more awake.  **Other details:** I'm 99% sure I didn't watch it on youtube; it was narrated by a dude with not the top-of-the-line mic, in English, and was roughly around 30-45 min. I discovered it on a classic list from a blog post when searching for these types of documentaries. I watched it per se in 2017 or 2016.  &#x200B;  Any help or slim lead you have, please let me know!

"Two Brothel Documentaries: Mustang And Chicken Ranch This article includes film stills. If you would like to see the illustrated version click here.    On the surface *Mustang: The House That Joe Built* and *Chicken Ranch* are two remarkably similar documentaries. Both take the viewer behind the curtain to see how a successful, legal brothel is run in Nevada. Part of the similarity between the two films is due to the similarity between the two brothels. The systems they use, how they are run, the way money is handled are all very similar.   *Mustang: The House That Joe Built* was made in 1977. *The Chicken Ranch* was made six years later in 1983, so even the fashion and feel of the films are similar, but for all their similarities there are some significant differences.   *The Chicken Ranch* film appears more sober, neutral, and honestly curious about the women, the managers, and the johns. *Mustang* has a voyeuristic element and does not get as close to its subjects. Both directors wanted to capture candid material and both felt it was important to go and hang out in the brothel for several weeks before they started filming. They both spoke about the need to set their subjects at ease.  *Chicken Ranch* was Nick Broomfield’s first film. He is careful to give his subjects enough interview time to provide some depth, but t’s a double-edged sword. The subjects have enough time to present themselves the way they want but as the camera keeps rolling they also end up revealing themselves in ways they might not have anticipated.  Broomfield does finally get in trouble with the brothel owner over filming the less glamorous aspects of the business. Walter Plankinton the head of the brothel (he does not refer to himself as a pimp) makes clear that he will allow Broomfield to film but Plankinton does want a certain amount of control over what is captured on film.   Mostly Plankinton wants to hide the more exploitative aspects of his business. Plankinton is an adept manipulator. He skillfully positions himself as a father figure to these vulnerable women. He plays the role of a loving, caring, and stern father who is looking out for the women’s best interest. His experience playing this role is apparent. He uses it to great effect and the women end up sincerely wanting to please him.  These sorts of dynamics are absent from Robert Guralnick’s movie. Guralnick is there to highlight the glamor of the brothel and if he includes some of the seedy side it is only to further an exotic and naughty air of adventure. Some of the women are briefly interviewed and there is a cursory attempt at providing some background and context, but the focus is more celebratory than inquisitive.   Both films have a glaring gap in their presentation. Anyone who watches either film will surely ask themselves how these documentarians not only got access to the brothels but also managed to get Johns to appear on film. Both documentaries omit what must have been very interesting interviews and briefings that took place in order to set up the scenes.  In *Mustang* the camera actually follows Johns into the bedrooms and films them having sex with the prostitutes. These are not hot young men with exhibitionist tendencies. The men are middle-aged, ordinary, seemly blue-collar fellahs with chubby middles, and sweaty foreheads. Not the kind of person you would expect to invite a camera into their sexual encounter. It seems likely that the pre-shooting briefings and agreements would probably be at least as revealing and interesting as anything else in the documentary. The sex scenes are not actually explicit in that we don’t see contact involving genitals, but we do see plenty of sex acts from carefully oriented angles. None of this occurs in *Chicken Ranch*. In Broomfield’s film, we follow the Johns into the private rooms to observe the monetary negotiations but exit before the clothing comes off.  It is ironic that in Mustang we see much more, but learn much less. We see the women take off their clothes and engage in sex, but even though the camera invades their privacy it fails to reveal anything very private. Partly it is due to the nature and atmosphere of the brothel where sex is front and center but boundaries are strictly maintained. Sex is allowed but intimacy is avoided.   The *Mustang* documentary only asks the women to reveal their bodies and their profession. The *Chicken Ranch* is after something far more intimate. Watching the women of the *Chicken Ranch* explain their motivations, situations, and dreams is uncomfortable. There is a sense that many of them are trying hard to rationalize a choice they regret. They try to justify to themselves and the viewer the decisions that brought them to the brothel. This is not a criticism of prostitution, it is simply apparent in the documentary that the women depicted are not joyfully enthusiastic about their profession, they are obviously harboring pain that is just under the surface and hard to hide.  The prurient objectification of the women in *Mustang*, and the intimate and coaxed confessions of *The Chicken Ranch* both present challenging ethical concerns. The relationship between documenter and documented is uncomfortable. It could be argued that Mustang is less invasive. In many ways, the charged nature of the subject matter insures that both documentaries draw attention to the position of the documenter and of the audience as we all take in what these women are being asked to offer up.  .",belgeselsever,q16ogn

"Emad Burnat’s Documentary Five Broken Cameras This article is illustrated with a lot of film stills. If you would like to see the illustrated version click here  [  The core of Emad Burnat’s documentary, 5 Broken Cameras, is deeply personal. Politics and social strife surround it, but Emad’s patient, gentle and insightful presence is what makes the film unique and compelling. You can argue about the Palestinians and the Israelis. You can disagree over motives, outcomes, and justice but you can not question Emad’s personal experience. Above all 5 Broken Cameras is about one man’s life that is transformed by the circumstances that surround him.  Emad was not a journalist or filmmaker, he was not an activist or documentarian, he was an olive farmer in Bil’ine. He bought a used video camera when his third son, Gibreel, was born so he could capture Gibreel growing up.  The film begins and ends with Gibreel. A beautiful child as adorable as he is vulnerable, but Gibreel’s home and growth are interrupted by an invasion that claimed 60% of his father’s farm overnight. Gibreel, like his father, must adapt. We witness Emad’s efforts to both shield his family as well as educate them as they are all abruptly initiated into a world of resistance and activism they never asked for.  Gibreel is Emad’s third son. Emad introduces each of his children by explaining what was happening when they were born. Mohamad was born in 1995 “a time of hope after the Oslo peace accords,” Yasim was born in 1998 “a time of uncertainty, “ Taki-Ysin was born in 2000 the day the intifada began, and Gibreel was born in 2005 the time when Emad began filming. The film was finished and released 7 years later in 2012.  Emad did not choose to include the Israeli invasion in his family home movies. The soldiers literally come to his front door and barge in. Israeli soldiers rip down his olive trees, they try to evict him from his home, they arrest him and take him away from his family. Emad could have been a completely apolitical person but simply by existing, he was set on a collision course with Israel. The film is an account of how Emad attempts to preserve his equanimity, provide a safe environment for his children, and engage the injustice that has been thrust upon his community.  Before the invasion, when Emad first got his video camera the villagers all turned to him as the town’s resident documentarian. He did not intend to occupy such a position but as the only one with a camera, the villagers came to him to tape weddings and town events. When the soldiers came it was only natural that he would be expected to capture that as well.  The five broken cameras from the title of the film were all broken by Israeli soldiers. Each camera is not only a testament to the violence visited upon Bil’in and its inhabitants but to the damage caused. The cameras are metaphors for Emad’s mind and body. No matter the scale of geopolitical conflicts they are still played out on the human body. Emad suffers repeated shocks both physically and psychically. In his narration, he remarks, “What I have to film demands a strong camera, not a fragile one.” The camera is a stand-in for Emad. Later he admits “When I film I feel like the camera will protect me, but it is an illusion.” This statement becomes strangely ironic when later gunfire hits the camera and the camera literally saves his life by stopping the bullet, but that is not Emad’s point. The camera is a coping mechanism akin to disassociation. It helps remove the camera person from what is happening around him or her, but Emad is right that it is only an illusion.  The relationship between the mind, the body, the state, and the camera is a constant theme throughout the film. Emad’s friend, nicknamed El-phil finds that the olive trees have been set on fire by the settlers, he cries out “What did the olive trees do? This olive tree that prays to God, what did it do?” There is a specific, corporal element to what is happening. The trees like human bodies are where the rubber of policies and politics hits the road of humanity.   Emad and his fellow protestors are all non-violent but every day the villagers suffer a hail of bullets, tear gas, arrests, evictions, and brutality. Emad seems most concerned with helping keep everyone sane. He expresses hope for the cause but near the end of the film, he reflects on what is happening, “Healing is a challenge in life. Its a victim’s sole obligation. By healing you resist oppression, but when I’m hurt over and over again I forget the wounds that rule my life. Forgotten wounds can’t be healed, so I film to heal.   Islam has a rich history of poetry and it is palpable in the way many Muslims speak. This last quote resonates with a profound insight that allows Emad to better understand himself, the people around him, and the events that transpire outside his control. Emad blends the personal and the political, as well as the individual and the cultural.  There is a painful scene where little Gibreel, perhaps 4 years old, is looking off into the distance through the barbed wire and watches a group of orthodox Jewish boys playing. There is no narration but there is a deep sense of unease as we wonder what is happening in Gibreel’s mind. What does he see? What is he learning? What world view is he forming?  What began for Emad as an opportunity to record family memories grew into activism and eventually a documentary. Emad brought his broken cameras and hours of footage to Guy Davidi, an Israeli filmmaker and anarchist. Together they constructed the film. Guy Davidi’s participation is a reminder that the state does not represent the will of all Israelis. The State is not concerned with the individual. It is indifferent to Emad’s suffering and to Guy Davidi dissent.  Five broken cameras is a layered film with more than one purpose and more than one meaning. It is like the Matryoshka nesting dolls in that each layer is inside the other. There is the macro vision of conflict and its effects, inside of which is an accounting of the conflict in Palestine, inside of which is the resistance in Bi’line. Then there are the individual villagers and their lives, followed by Emad and then Gibreel. Each arena is smaller and more personal. From Gibreel it cycles back to the more abstract and philosophical arena of conflict and its effect on humanity. Emad negotiates these layers seamlessly, inviting the viewer to blend them into a coherent understanding of what is happening in the desert by the sea.",belgeselsever,j7fqaf

"King of Beasts | review - "" a work of admirable journalistic seriousness, one that goes about its business with a clear-eyed precision"" - The Hollywood Reporter ## Tomer Almagor and Nadav Harel's wildlife-themed documentary world-premiered at the Oldenburg International Film Festival in northern Germany.  Oscar Wilde pithily dissed fox-hunting as ""the unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable,"" a withering dismissal which might apply to those 21st century big-game hunters who can be seen grinningly posing with their kills across social media. Seeking to go beyond the outrage such images — particularly those commemorating the killing of famous Zimbabwean lion ""Cecil"" in 2015 — regularly stoke, Tomer Almagor and Nadav Harel's *King of Beasts* is a deliberately disturbing documentary portrait of one lion-killer who genuinely believes he's doing the species (and their human neighbors) a big favor.  World-premiering at Oldenburg in northern Germany, this American production is a more mainstream-oriented and conventional affair than Ulrich Seidl's clinical, widely screened *Safari*(2016), which dealt with similar subject matter. With relative newcomers Almagor and Harel lacking the cachet of Seidl's name, however, this up-close-and-personal immersion in a world many actively avoid experiencing in any way will likely fare best at non-fiction festivals and via small-screen exposure.  The directors are careful to be even-handed in their portrayal of their main protagonist Aaron Neilson, a burly thirtysomething dude with bulging tattooed muscles and what he himself describes as an ""A-type personality."" Working as a hunting guide in Colorado, Neilson — whose living room she shares with several stuffed big cats, diorama-style — clearly lives for his trips to Tanzania, where he goes after his prey with steely determination and considerable patience.  Indeed, the actual moments of violent death in *King of Beasts* are few and far between: First to bite the dust is a buffalo, just before the half-hour mark, whose carcass provides dinner for Neilson, his safari companeros and their entourage of paid native servants, and also serves as bait for the crew's bigger targets. A hippo is also slain for the latter purpose, setting us up for the climactic encounter with the king of the jungle, an ""old lion"" who shows up just after the hour mark, and whom Neilson goes after using the old-school method of bow and arrow.  As well as shedding light on the mechanics of safari hunting — which involves a lot of patience, waiting and downtime — *King of Beasts* illuminates as an exploration of masculine self-image (Neilson evidently sees himself as heroic and Hemingway-esque) and of how macho hombres engage with each other in close-quarters situations. One of Neilson's party is a greenhorned younger fellow mainly employed to flatteringly record Neilson's exploits for posterity via video in a series of carefully staged tableaux.  The main ethical risk run by the directors is that the simple fact of their having chosen Neilson as their subject will bolster his self-regard and contribute to the way he validates and justifies his own activities. They maintain a fly-on-the-wall neutrality, observing silently as Neilson and his buddies explain what they see as the economic and ecological justifications for actions many would condemn as cruelly repugnant.  A final title-card does adopt an unambiguously negative stance, however (the film is, after, all, ""made with the support of the Humane Society of the USA""). Almagor and Harel indict Neilson and his ilk for ""exacerbating the problem"" by exploiting the relative poverty of economically downtrodden places such as Tanzania that welcome such free-spending foreign visitors with open arms.  Edited by Harel down to a no-nonsense 85 minutes and abounding in sharply telling juxtapositions and transitions, *King of Beasts* — like the majority of documentaries these days — musically gilds the lily at times. There are moments when Simon Taufique's music threatens the comprehensibility of the dialogue, others where it seeks to amp up the tension of events depicted with counterproductive results. But this is otherwise a work of admirable journalistic seriousness, one that goes about its business with a clear-eyed precision that even Neilson and his chums should grudgingly respect.     *Production companies: Creative Monster Productions, Noprocess Films, Pride Games, Urban Tales Productions*   *Directors: Tomer Almagor, Nadav Harel*   *Producers: Bryan Gambogi, Gabrielle Almagor, Mark Steele, Tomer Almagor*   *Cinematographer-editor: Nadav Harel*   *Composer: Simon Taufique*   *Venue: Oldenburg International Film Festival*   *Sales: Gravitas Pictures, El Segundo, California (scott@gravitasventures.com)*     *In English, Swahili*   *85 minutes*",belgeselsever,aka8sw

"Abbas Kiarostami’s Early Documentary First Graders This article contains a lot of film stills. For a fully illustrated version please click here - [  Abbas Kiarostami’s documentary film *First Graders* is irresistible. It’s simple and straightforward, but it grabs hold of you and doesn’t let go. Kiarostami is a master of simplicity. He knows that stories can arise from tiny, seemingly insignificant moments. In the film, a child loses his orange plastic cup and it is enough to completely engross the viewer. It isn’t a dire situation, but the child is scared that his mother will yell at him and you can see he is ashamed. His desperation draws you in and before you know it, you are engrossed in the saga of the orange plastic cup.  The film is little more than a series of minor problems being presented by children to the principal of the school. Kiarostami doesn’t bother with narration or inter-titles. We don’t know anything about the school or the teachers, he simply focuses on the children and the principal as they all try to get through the day.  About half the film is spent in the principal’s office. The camera is placed behind the principal’s chair, so we share his point of view as each child delivers his testimony. They mumble, bow their heads, sniffle, and shuffle their feet as they try to summon the courage to speak. It feels a little like Kurosawa’s ***Rashomon*** where the petitioner or witness testifies directly to the audience, leaving the audience to decide what to do. How to address these children and help them navigate the schoolyard falls on us, but then the principal steps in and we have to evaluate his response.  The principal is certainly gentle. He gives them his full attention, but he also requires that the children speak up and look him in the face. After witnessing several encounters, it seems that each meeting is more about fostering the courage to stand up and speak the truth than the specifics of whatever happened. This, in and of itself, can be a useful lesson. By standing in front of the principal and pronouncing your mistake or misbehavior, you have to own it. Admitting loud and clear that you hit someone is a punishment in itself. In the heat of a fight, misdeeds can be rationalized, but in the principal's office, having to clearly admit your transgression can foster self-awareness.  There is a seriousness and gravity to every story, but there is humor too. The first altercation is between two boys in the back of a line. The principal asks, “What are you doing back there?”, and one of the boys answers, “Spitting on each other”, in a perfectly matter-of-fact tone.  Each boy that presents himself in the film (they are all boys, it’s a boys' school) opens our hearts, and we must watch as he faces the consequences of his actions. The school has a set of rules for conflict. If someone insults or hits you, you must tell him that he has done wrong. Then, you ask for an apology. If he apologizes then, you must forgive him. If he does not apologize, you should report his behavior to the principal.  The principal doesn’t punish the children, but he makes them face what they have done and promise not to do it again. If they repeat the behavior, the principal gets more stern and may even threaten to expel the student, but during the film, we never see him actually do so.  It could be argued that the principal oversimplifies each altercation and does not consider all that went into what caused it. He is more concerned with what a given child does and less concerned with why they did it, or how they felt. In his favor, he does often ask why a child did what they did, but they never have an answer. First graders are not particularly in touch with their inner motivations or emotional states. The principal gets them to face the situation and then tries to foster a sense of appropriate and measured justice.  In the end, it doesn’t matter if you approve or disapprove of how the children are handled by the school. The heart of the film is about confession, truth, punishment, and redemption. The film was made in 1984, only 5 years after the revolution in Iran. Both during and after the revolution, thousands of people were subjected to torture, forced confession, and imprisonment. The painful and frightening encounters with authority that these children undergo are clearly a means to examine power and coercion, and how they affect our sense of self.  *First Graders* was one in a series of films Kiarostami made when he worked at the institute he helped to found called *The Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults,* also known as *Kanun*. The films he produced there may have been for the benefit of children, but they were much more. All of the films Kiarostami produced at the institute were double-entendre vehicles for examining hegemony and morality. They provided ethical challenges that the audience, be they children or adults, had to resolve for themselves. They focused on how the law affects individual lives.   In Iran, Kiarostami could not speak directly about power, but by couching everything in the world of children, he managed to get past the censors. Children are allowed to question authority or protest against their parents' punishments. Children are allowed to consider the different possible courses of action they can take. Children’s problems are seen as insignificant, but Kiarostami not only saw the child’s perspective, but saw that these first encounters with power are of critical importance. Power, patriarchal power in particular, begins at home. Fathers and father figures are set up to be absolute authorities. Learning to follow the patriarch and to substitute his judgment for your own grooms you for further obedience in the future.  These themes of power and submission are so obvious in Kiarostami’s films, I can’t help but wonder what the Iranian censors were thinking. Iran is not an easy place to make films or speak truth to power. Right now as I write this, thousands of Iranians are facing down a new wave of torture, imprisonment, and murder. Iranians who grew up in the schools where these documentaries were made have summoned the courage to speak up, perhaps inspired by encounters like the ones with the principal in the film, only this time, it is in the face of a terrifying theocratic dictatorship.",belgeselsever,11pjr1b

Also he taxed 50 million in money from the conquered territory and looted 85 million and 20 thousand talents more and gave it to the roman state and its people, while to his soldiers he gave at least 15000 drachmae to each    When lucullus had returned from asia after being ill treated by pompey, he was received by the senate with the utmost honor and when later on pompey also had returned from asia, the senate started begging lucullus to defend the interest of the state from pompeys supposed machinations. Although lucullus had accustomed himself with a life of leisure and he had catos help, he nevertheless vigorously retracted pompeys banishment of his laws. Pompey, now humiliated, sought protection with tribunal power, therefore giving himself to young and inexperienced men, the most despicable being clodius    Clodius used to walk around the forum with pompey by his side making sure that all the interest of the common folk were being attended. Clodius also made pompey to exile cicero, the one who had helped Pompey a lot before. Cicero even tried to plea for his life but pompey shut his house door and fled from the back. So fearing for his life, cicero immediately left the city    Now, caesar being returned from his governorship he passed a law that brought him much popularity, then he got the consulship and started passing laws that would distribute land and found new cities so he could increase even further his popularity",belgeselsever,zzs29s

This documentary has definitely helped people more sympathize with her. I see comments on many of her YouTube songs, loving and praising her songs(referencing ""Miss Americana""), and people online seem to like her telling her story.  Like her or not, this documentary is really well made, and the sound mixing is really great too! (well that's her songs, so it gotta be)",belgeselsever,f7gmvs

"[Review] Cobain: Montage Of Heck (my personal review) Okay, as a very big fan of Nirvana/Kurt Cobain I'm here to tell you about the new Cobain documentary.  First of all, if you are not a 100% aware of what happened to Kurt in his years alive, then you're probably going to like this film. However, if like me, you've read ""Heavier than heaven"" and seen ""Kurt and Courtney"" documentary, you will find it slightly disappointing.  It completely covers up his death, it is not mentioned at all during the film except for the very end when it says 'Kurt took his own life at 27'.  Now for me, I was hoping to get more detail on these events because after all, his death/suicide immortalised him and is a very big part to the Cobain story. The same goes with Amy Winehouse and Jim Morrison etc.  I also found with this documentary that it's full of annoying journal illustrations, which is frustrating also if you've read his journal book, because it just took up unnecessary space in this film. Saying all of this, it was nice to see how Kurt was in his personal life, they did however portray him as a bad/paranoid/unstable person, which yes he probably was, but so are a lot of people who can't handle fame.  You can tell just by watching it that it was trying to avoid some important information, such as 'what happened after he was out of his coma?' And 'the events leading up to his death, what pushed him further to commit?'. They also didn't mention Buddah (his childhood imaginary friend) which as I've understood, is a very big part of hide life.  The conclusion is, it's an average film about someone's life, but as a documentary I was hoping to find out more in depth answers.   4/10",belgeselsever,34m2wj

This year (2024) the nominations in the short documentary category are again very interesting. Big politics in a small lens and the “American dream” is the dominant slogan.

Being an Indian, I can say that there is a tendency among Indians to be proud when they marry a white woman, as the wife kinda becomes a trophy to show off in the community.

"Pompeian-caesarian civil war (comprehensive text in the post)   At the time of caesars first consulship election, he saw that pompey and crassus was contending for hegemonic power over the republic and understanding that he also had a lot of power, he therefore could unbalance this competition by whatever side he pleased    And according to Plutarch, it was exactly what he did and it seems it was by the most Machiavellic means. Cato also said that it was not the competition between pompey and caesar that brought ruin to the republic in the end, but in fact it was their Machiavellic friendship its doom    Caesar made so much popular measures in his consulship that in fact he transformed it in a tribuneship, merging two powers for himself. But when an important senator and cato was ready to give him trouble, he brought pompey to the rostra and made him pledge that he would protect caesar with violence if needed    Pompey was so given to caesar that he even married his daughter, who was to be already married to another man. Its crazy to think, but to pacify this man, pompey gave his own daughter to him, when in fact she also was promised to sullas son. Maybe it was coincidental, but now caesar also decided to marry a noble woman     But pompey being tired of being treated as cat and shoe by all his allies, he rose as an ultimate tyrant and filled the capital with armed soldiers. All of his measures was by the use of force and now the capital lived in a constant fear of sudden death",belgeselsever,103zkfn

"Been following an old capital murder case from 1998, dude wrongfully convicted of murder, was given a life sentence and this past week after 26 years it was reopened. The doc is called Stolen Freedom. There's a trailer for it out on Youtube and it doesn't have much traction, but I've been looking into the case a bit. Apparently on New Years Eve 1997, like 60 people were hanging out in a parking lot at a gas station in Houston, Texas listening to music, trunks open, model cars out. The crowd at the gas station was all aged at around 21. After midnight, a troubled 14-year-old from the area came into the parking lot and got into a dispute with a few people in front of a nice car. He was high and intoxicated, got upset and pulled out a gun. A 21-year-old guy from his neighborhood who had seen the kid around saw him doing this and didn't want him to make a mistake that could cost him his life in prison, so he ran over to the 14-year-old kid, told him to stop, pulled on his arm, and the kid turned the gun on him. At this point the people in front of the nice car once being held at gunpoint took off running. The 14 year old turned back around, panicked and fired twice, killing the owner of the car. Within 60 seconds, that parking lot was empty. Over the course of a week or so, somehow police got the impression that the 21 year old (who tried to stop the kid) was actually an accomplice because he was older. The police also believed it was an attempted robbery of the car instead of a dispute. When it was all said and done, the 21 year old (Roman Flores) was brought to trial as an accomplice to a capital murder (because of the ""attempted robbery""), and couldn't pay to represent himself well. He was assigned by the Houston courts an attorney named Jerry Guirenot who has had 39 death row cases and lost every single one. Needless to say, Roman was poorly represented, not able to tell his side of the story, and given a life sentence. He's spent the past 26 years in prison. A non-profit attorney started working on his case for free 4 years ago, and just this past week, it got re-opened and he's going back to trial. The doc is trying to raise funding for the filming of the trial right now, but its an interesting story so far.",belgeselsever,1ekfbkr
"Missing turns to murder series on Netflix Just watched this on Netflix. Latest series. The episode about Jane Harrison where Kevin Doherty was convicted of her murder and did a sentence. She’s never been found. He’s out. WHY can he not say where she is? If he did now it would have no affect on his life as he’s already done his time. Why keep that from her family? I mean I guess he murdered a person, so he’s pretty awful as a person. I just feel so much for these families who end up knowing their loved one has been murdered and they never find them.

I think it was aired on HBO at the time I just remember the killer had murdered a woman and placed her body in concrete either at an abandoned piece of land or in a forest. The only details I remember is the doc showing the face of the woman or a woman covered in cement like a statute with a piece of her hair sticking out, I believe she was blonde.

"Youtube Talking Heads Lately it feels like this sub is just an advertisement for certain people's youtube channels where they talk about this or that crime. These are not documentaries, folks. That's not to say a documentary can't be watched on Youtube, but if you're producing content for Youtube on a $0 budget and you're not leaving your house to do any research, interviews, take your own photos and video, or even calling from your home to have phone interviews or collect documents or really anything at all-- that's not a documentary.  &#x200B;  Sitting and talking to a camera about a crime you researched on the internet and then giving your opinion is not a documentary. Please stop exploiting this sub to promote your youtube channels. I realize it's not a terribly active sub but can we at least keep it dedicated to the content it was intended for?",belgeselsever,kckjji

"Some Great True Crime Documentaries and hidden gems Hello,  I am a big true crime fan and when it comes to this genre, I have listed below some of the really great documentaries worth a watch.

The Jinx - life and deaths of Robert Durst   Synopsis - A groundbreaking six-part documentary directed and produced by Andrew Jarecki and produced and shot by Marc Smerling (the Oscar nominees behind `Capturing the Friedmans'). The story delves into the strange history of real estate heir Robert Durst, long suspected in the still-unsolved 1982 disappearance of his wife as well as the subsequent murders of family friend Susan Berman and neighbour Morris Black. The Jinx' results from nearly a decade of research by the filmmakers, who expose police files, key witnesses, never-before-seen footage, private prison recordings, and thousands of pages of formerly hidden documents.

Into the abyss  Synopsis - Filmmaker Werner Herzog explores capital punishment in America through interviews with convicted killers, their victims' families and members of the Texas criminal justice system.  Available on [Free] -   P.S. There is a great mini-series by Werner Herzog called On Death Row available on youtube.  3. Paradise Lost Trilogy  Synopsis - Three teenagers are accused of this horrific crime of killing three children, supposedly as a result of involvement in Satanism.

"The most dishonest crime documentary you have seen? I am going to ask a couple of questions.  1. What is the most dishonest or misleading documentary you have seen? 2. What documentary impacted you most this year (whether released previously or not)?  In an effort to not be a hypocrite, I am going to try to do my part in getting this sub more action.   I think ""True Crime"" has always been of substantial interest to the public, but in the past few years it's really exploded. Unfortunately, that interest has also included predatory producers who were looking for the next Paradise Lost, and cared less about injustice (or whether a case even had any injustice) than they did about publicity and money.  I saw some amazing films this year. We all probably saw Tiger King. The Most Dangerous Animal of All, and a Wilderness of Error also stand out in my mind. I rewatched The Woman Who Wasn't There, an interesting exterior study of a pathological liar, albeit not exactly CRIMINAL. I have also listened to a ton of podcasts in the documentary and investigative style.   &#x200B;  This has the potential to become an impassioned and heated debate (if anyone actually replies!) so let's try to be extra chill and do more inquiring than arguing.

"The Hmong Sleep Deaths/ The Real Life Nightmare on Elm Street Hello ! Just finished a small project on the Hmong Sleep Deaths of the 1980's, wasn't super familiar with the case till semi recently was wondering if people were already familiar with the story of if it was new to them. Brief Summary- In the late 70's - 1980's , over 117 deaths of young Southeast Asian (many Hmong )men were reported, with similar like details of seemingly healthy young individuals going to sleep for the night only to never wake back up . With such a high rate of cases affecting such a small demographic at the time the events seemed unexplainable. Leading to the CDC to become involved in 1981, the phenomena would be classified as SUNDS or Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome. Although medical science looked for answers, the Hmong people claimed to already know what was affecting the a evil spirt named the Dab Tog, and entity that haunts its victims in the dream world and leads to their death in real life. The newspaper articles about the case would later inspire Wes Craven who after reading of the Hmong men crafted the infamous character Freddy Krueger of Nightmare on Elm Street. ^",belgeselsever,1ard0ui

"Justice for Tiffany Jenks murder how to get honest help When I was told by Tiffany “John they want to kill me” and it happened I began to investigate.   As a normal person i gave 100% to inform Police what i had for details.   &#x200B;  Later they went on national TV ID Discovery “Wonderland murder“ And lied about what i said to them.  &#x200B;  when I asked Police for the exact items they gave ID Discovery my reqest was “We do not have it”  &#x200B;  at no time have I got even 7 years later the CCTV from the bar That will prove i was 100% right.   &#x200B;  Tiffany Jenks murder was Not random and the only logical reason that i get a following of Cult members discrediting me and blocking my posts is they want you to not look into the case.  &#x200B;  no matter what comments you read after i post anyplace online you will see a series  of    “Conspiracy“ theory’s or “John is crazy Tiffanys family did not drive her dead Brody in her car 5 hours DEAD”   “John was abusive to Tiffany“  ”Tiffany had a court order on John”  John was a covicited sex offender“   &#x200B;  any possible number of fake claims to get you to do one of two things   &#x200B;  GIVE UP. Or help them further push this story back..  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  They also claim my Story keeps changing yet as shown they do not say what that story is ?  like John said A then said B  &#x200B;  keep in mind he only goal they have is Discrecdit and distract and for fun each of you should show some LOVE and mess with Them... ask them what did you say ?  &#x200B;  in one post we Read “I interviewed John for 3 hours and his case or words were not true“  yet he does not list the “Not true“ you would think if a person like myself flew all the way to London the guy who made the podcast would tell us the truth yet he did not. The truth does not come from my words I’m only replying what is known from the record. Its not me making this up..   &#x200B;  Tiffany told me she will be killed. And she was. (What do you say to that Mr Posdcast)  that above is on my CCTV and its not my words its on the CCTV  &#x200B;  Tiffany told the bartender she will die and her life is over. ( the night she was killed) and she was)  but his Podcast failed to say that.  &#x200B;  do you think if a person comes on reddit seeking justice as was and am.... that if i cant type well or write well due to my own problems  that they could look past my abiulity to write a story and Just take facts?   &#x200B;  They wont ...   &#x200B;  the murder of tiffany jenks was never solved and if they Reddit has a LAW group or page maybe some one will help and link this to them ....   LAW is not my opinion and This case Police who lied should be outed...  and by going one by one the cult just freaks out and then attacks me..  &#x200B;  I’m a witness to a murder and when i came forward I should not have been harassed.   &#x200B;  One group said i was blocked from a area of reddit since this case in there opinion is a conspiracy  theory. Well it is only because   &#x200B;  her dad was the lead Scientist as Los Alamos ?     Tiffany recorded her therapist and that doctor 10 days before killed said she better not tell anyone especially me or she will be a target and targets get shot at first... 10 days after she was Shot.  &#x200B;  the facts to this case are what some call a conspiracy but the murder is not... why was she killed .... it depends all i know is i was set up on the murder. Tiffany knew she would die   &#x200B;  Police 100% lied about this case and all this got put onto the guy in prison..  &#x200B;  But its not solved and the fact that they  Continue  to be able To put me down and also lie at the same time is nuts... for example Police claim “Tiffany met the killers for the first time“ yet the josh in the audip she recorded before her death (and on my cell She had) and after i go the audio of her talking to Josh her ex roommate  rick told me   &#x200B;  “John she knew lots of joshes“  ”John she had 3 joshes at funeral“  ”John Josh is not the right josh listen to the ID Discovery“  &#x200B;  i said Rick the Josh is the Josh go to google type in   &#x200B;  PVT JOSHUA. ROBINETT and see what Tiffany had searched on my computer on September 20th 2013 she was dead October 8th 2013 and magically that google search I found by typing letters PV and it shows old searches.  &#x200B;  PVT Josh Robbinet was also charged with child mollestation in this case and the shooter said he seen the mom and him on her child. How is that A conspiracy ?   &#x200B;  What i want out of this reddit post is to ask all of you to take 5 minutes and think is it fair to the victim Tiffany Jenks to have a life time of abuse, get shot, and no justice and you would have to be nuts to nit think this case should be told in a truthful manor.,.  &#x200B;  Tiffany was kidnpped   killed   and 3 killers and police are desperate to make you think untrue things.. who cares if she drank or did a drug... is that now ok for murder ?   &#x200B;  Police in this case lied as ddI her family and all that leads to why ? Why would a 30’s women be in full control of 31 dams on the Columbia river and claim to be a victim of Mind control and then when She is killed i look into the case and 4,000 randomly odd people attack me and not once talk about killers..   &#x200B;  and not tell what happened while at the same time protect a shrink or Doctor who tells tiffany she better do this or that or she will die? He ask said she cant touch him as he has a girlfriend ?  &#x200B;  the ongoing issue of her drinking is nonsense it’s what the group wants you to believe That if a girl gets killed and she drank she’s to blame,..     &#x200B;  be mindful of the ongoing ability of them to Try hard to discredit me without saying any logical thing like what ? What are you telling me.... here is examples   &#x200B;  “John‘s Story Keeps changing“. But they never tell what story ... you see this murder had 152 facts they only tell you I’m wrong ? So what did i list as facts and what did i get wrong ? Then what did they list as facts and i will tel you how they are wrong if they are and the proof.  They want you to not help Tiffany so they lie but as a rule back up the story.... tell us the facts... and if i cant wrtie well maybe i can pay someone to help me... write facts... the group will not help me why ?  &#x200B;  Tiffanys 3 killers got paid to kill her. And Police protected the 2 Michelle and Joshua why ? Why did Michelle who Removed the serial numbers from the gun that day drove the car, cross state line, kidnapp a girl to kill her, and then provide the gun and then claim when they got busted  &#x200B;   ”we did not hear the gun go off ?  we could hear Tiffany and the shooter argue“ but not a gun?   &#x200B;  They then told police they sold that gun to the shooter.... but he paid the next day... so thats selling a gun with removed serial lnumbers for murder... and no big deal to Police..  &#x200B;  why was Michelle out of jail in just 11days ? Why ?  &#x200B;  1. they said Tiffany just met them thats a lie 2 guys said she was in a AA. Meeting with them.  2. Tiffany talked to Josh in audio recordings and i hav them off my phone she had..  3. tiffany was kidnapped and knew she woudl be killed. 4. Tiffany told me and the bar tender she will die..  &#x200B;  &#x200B;   What i hope happens is some other groups do grasps LAW  or a web Sleuth and they start looking into this murder and are not easily persuaded by nonsense that stops justice.",belgeselsever,i3tsqu

"Episode 2 - 1991 The Pace Memorandum & The LDS Church Hello! Just finished up a small project on the LDS / Mormon Church in Utah and a piece of material I focused in on was the The Pace Memorandum.  Brief Summary in 1990 - 91 a leaked document came out from within the LDS Church and its elders listing acts of ritual abuse . The document written by elder Bishop Glen L. Pace, stated that he had personally met with 60 individuals who all detailed similar or nearly identical like details of abuse within the Church. The reports include cases of sexual assault/ physical assault/ mental abuse and study of satanic doctrine and is some cases infant sacrifice or cannibalism. The reports were so outlandish that even Bishop Pace initially doubted the validity of the claims till he was personally convinced through each victims testimony and from seeing the obvious damage it had caused to those subjected . Bishop Pace wrote the 12 page memorandum in hopes to bring justice to the victims and shine a light but his report would fall on deaf ears from other church elders . The document never intended for the public leaked to the press in 1991 eventually drawing police attention causing a 30 month long investigation that would deem that no credible testimony's were ever given and this to be attributed to false memories.  Again so much , can keep writing but for the sake of time I'll leave it there, please check out the vid or read the memo for your linked the documents",belgeselsever,19b90jd

"A forgotten murder and hidden injustice in Ireland Hi everyone! I cover lesser known cases here in Ireland on YouTube.   I am currently covering the missing and murder women from the 1990s but also looking at earlier cases, and if they could be relevant or connected.   In my latest [video]( I look at the unsolved murder of Una Lynskey in 1971. Una was walking down a small lane to her home but she never made it. Neighbours would say they heard screams on the lane.   3 locals lads were quickly singled out as suspects, with dire consequences.   I look at Ireland's ""Murder Squad"" a special team of detectives with ""special interrogation techniques"" and the miscarriage of justice that followed.   If you are looking for new content please consider checking out my channel [Dark Vaults]( tell me what you think of this case. Was the killer known to Una? Was it a chance encounter?   If there is an Irish case you would like to see covered let me know.  Thanks :)",belgeselsever,ubi5yi

"Thabo Bester - South African Crime Story Thabo Bester: A Trail of Destruction is a gripping documentary series that sheds light on the life and crimes of Thabo Bester, a notorious South African criminal dubbed the ""Facebook Rapist"". Bester was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 2012 for rape and murder, but even from behind bars, he continued to run scams and businesses.  In 2022, news broke that Bester had died in a fire that broke out in his cell, but in 2023, it was discovered that he had actually escaped and was living a lavish life with his girlfriend, a medical doctor, in Hyde Park, an affluent suburb in Johannesburg, South Africa. It's alleged that Bester had received help from high-ranking individuals to facilitate his escape from the maximum-security prison.  The documentary series delves into Bester's troubled childhood, marked by trauma and crime, as well as his reign of terror as the ""Facebook Rapist"". Using Facebook, Bester lured young women under the pretence of being a modelling agency, and his crimes were so heinous that they earned him the moniker ""Facebook Rapist"".  The series also examines the broader societal issues that allowed Bester to operate with relative impunity for so long, including corruption, fraud and gender-based violence. By exploring the emotional destruction that Bester caused to his victims and their families, the series provides a poignant reminder of the need for justice and accountability in South Africa.  The revelation of Bester's escape and subsequent capture in Tanzania, after an international manhunt, adds an intriguing new layer to the story. The documentary series, titled ""Thabo Bester: A Trail of Destruction,"" will be a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of crime, trauma, and corruption in South Africa.",belgeselsever,1jg0mq5

The original narrator of the show was Peter Thomas and I think Bill Camp or someone else did the narrating for an few special episodes for the show.  But I wanted to know as the narrator for the shows did you prefer Peter Thomas or Bill Camp, I mean I understand Peter Thomas passed away so he is obviously unable to do it so if the creators of the shows want the show to continue they would have to employ another narrator. My pick is Peter Thomas in my opinion there is no one that can replace Peter Thomas. When he spoke he gave some people the scares.",belgeselsever,rjbd25

"One Man Band and the Monkey – A DIY Music Documentary About Rebels, Loners and Geniuses Hey everyone,  We’ve been filming a documentary for the past few years about one of the rawest and most eccentric corners of music history: **the One Man Band**. The film is called **“One Man Band and the Monkey”**, and it’s a wild journey into the origins, philosophy, and chaos of doing it all *yourself* — musically and spiritually.  This has been a deeply personal ride. Over the years, I’ve:  * Interviewed **Dave Harris** (author of *Head, Hands & Feet*) in Victoria, BC * Followed **Reverend Beat-Man** across Europe * Toured with **Dad Horse Experience** * Discovered the **Oktopus Orkestars** playing their guts out on the streets, leaving me completely hypnotized and drooling over their show  And many others you’ll get to meet in the documentary… **if we ever finish it**.  The problem? We've approached tons of producers and funders, but no one wanted to support it. So in true **DIY** fashion — just like the people in this film — we’re going to finish it on our own. We’re prepping a **Kickstarter campaign**, hoping that the same underground spirit that fuels this music can help get the film across the finish line.  This isn’t just a film about music. It’s about:  * **Freedom vs. compromise** * **Lo-Fi, duct tape and dreams** * **Loneliness on the road** * **The need to communicate, even when no one’s listening**  From **Hasil Adkins** locking himself in a bathroom to record punk-country chaos, to modern road-warriors like **Bob Log III**, **Dead Elvis**, and **Dollar Bill**, these artists redefine what it means to “make it” — not in the industry, but in life.  🎬 Trailer and updates: [onemanbandandthemonkey.com](   📸 Instagram: [u/onemanbandandthemonkey](   📺 YouTube: [PrimitiveMovies](   🎧 Spotify Playlist: [The Sound of One Man Bands](  If this kind of madness speaks to you, I’d love your support — even just sharing helps.

"‘Whores Glory’ song identification At one scene in the documentary taking place in Bangladesh, there is an old Bangladeshi/Indian music video that is shown playing on a television for about 10 seconds or so. I’ve had the song stuck in my head and can’t seem to find it anywhere. It happens at around 1 hour and 58 minutes into the documentary. It’s of a man and a woman in a red shirt on the street pulling eachother back and forth.   Can anyone potentially identify this for me? Whores Glory can be found on Netflix or online.",belgeselsever,9egz4u

Looking for the Rickie Lee Jones 1996 Documentary Does anyone know where I could find a copy of the 'unsanctioned' Rickie Lee Jones Documentary directed by Ethan A. Russell? I've been looking for a copy of it online to purchase and it seems it's out of distribution because of the record label? It seems there were some disputes about music rights and now it's completely off the market. It's called 'Naked Songs: The Life and Times of Rickie Lee Jones' and was released at a few film festivals in 1995/1996 but it seems to have disappeared from existence.   Here it is on [Rotten Tomatoes]( \[with no score because I guess no one's been able to actually watch it this century\] and it's listed on [IMDb]( Asking on reddit is literally my last hope to find this film. Last year there was a VHS of it for sale from a private seller in Italy for over $100 but now it seems that's not an option anymore ... any suggestions on how to hunt down a copy of this film would be most appreciated.,belgeselsever,1jju926
