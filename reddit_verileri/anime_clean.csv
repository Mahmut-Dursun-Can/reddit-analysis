"""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" felt really special I love coming of the age stories and jump at every other show with that tag on it but very few of them stick with you, the ones that seem unforgettable. I just finished watching The girl who Leapt through time and i think it is one of those movies that I can't forget.   Talking about the ending, how Makoto promises Chiaki that she will see her in the future even though she knows that they will never see each other again is sad and beautiful at the same time, knowing that Makoto would dedicate her life to preserving that painting and making sure that Chiaki one day gets to see it breaks something inside me, but still it really is beautiful, this kinda love.",anime,1ko81w4

"Does anyone fear finishing an anime ? Recently I watched some really good shows, or shows that really put you in their world(watching little witch academie now), as if you were  the camera man or right next to the characters experiencing the world.  And now when I finish the anime, I feel so sad and depressed as if that ""experience"" completely ended and everything us over. Having to let go of it as if everyone died.   I might be childish saying this but I want more episodes... I want to keep enjoying and experiencing it and the feeling of letting go hurts.   Maybe this is a result of me being not jealous but, yeah... jealous of how interesting their Iives are and how mine will never be. Like for example magic academie is so interesting but in another universe, our universe might seem super natural too. I'm still too immature for wanting what I don't have and not seeing what I have. But what I have is just plain old ordinary. Not matter how much I appreciate it, it still is.

If anyone is interested I would be happy to send my full list . But this list is just ones I am unsure about . Thanks in advance 😊 TLDR following is a list of anime if you know could you inform me of if there is a dub and if so where I can watch it?   	1.	Dangers in My Heart 	2.	Dandadan 	3.

"I'm dying for something like this (Slight spoilers on the basic plot of Re:Zero) I'm looking for an anime, preferably romance but can be other genres too. I want to find something that portrays the same love between two very popular and two of my favorite anime characters OAT. The two characters are Satella the witch of Envy and Subaru Natsuki from Re:Zero. I love the way the love works I find it so fascinating how Satella is this great evil being that loves subaru so much that it's all she takes action for. The fact that Subaru is confused by her love and hates the way that she showed it (giving him RBT because he hates dying and wants it to stop) makes it even more fascinating to watch. Ive always wanted to see an anime focused on specifically the love between a protagonist who is scared of an evil being who is madly inlove with him. Satella, although being the witch of envy and mosty seen as an antagonist, definitely has my heart and I see her as my favorite character in the anime.

"Help finding an anime about motorcycles I saw when i was little. I can only rememeber a few things so I dont have a lot of faith in finding it or what i remeber being usefull  this is all I can for sure remember.  1 it was about motorcycles     2 It was mostly about one on one races  3 the races where not realistic in the way that sometimes it would go upside down, with imposible twists, etc.  This is all I remember but im not sure if its real  1 the main premise is about being the best racer  2 the main character had at least one female friend with a light blue motorcycle  3 they where in another world (I have that feeling but im not sure if this was part of it)     I can only remember vividly part of a chapter where the main guy loses a race against another guy and gets depressed and then her friend teaches him about not giving up.(I might be remembering averything wrong)  As I said.

"My Thoughts on Mobile Suit Gundam AGE Okay, so I've finally made it to one of the most notoriously terrible Gundam anime of all time.  Most people that I've read reviews on for this series hate it.  And...they're not wrong.  Although like usual I want to give credit where credit is due.  There are a lot of interesting ideas in this series.  It has an art style change and while I'm not a huge fan of it, as some of the characters reminds me of Pokemon which I don't think works with Gundam, especially a Gundam that takes itself seriously, I still appreciate the creativity.  As for as themes are concerned, the main theme has to do with generational trauma.  I don't think that specific theme has been covered in Gundam before.  Even in the original Gundam it doesn't really discuss generational trauma, Amuro's dad was in the military but Amuro was never intended to pilot the Gundam so that doesn't really count.        To cover this theme the story spans a total of 49 years in the Advanced Generation timeline.  The first protagonist is Flit Asuno, then after 15 episodes we get a timeskip and follow his son, Asemu Asuno, and then after episode 29 the MC becomes Flit's grandson Kio Asuno, and it remains that way until the end of the anime.  This gave the series a great opportunity to explore what happens when trauma, in this case war trauma, gets passed down to your descendants, and you give your child and grandchild, intentionally or unintentionally he same desires for revenge and death that you obtained because of the tragic events that occurred to you.  But unfortunately, it just doesn't pan out the way they wanted it to in my opinion.        The first 15 episodes were definitely the best part.  It wasn't incredible, but it built a fantastic foundation for something that could have become great.  I think Flit's character was good.  He starts in a similar situation to Amuro, where he pilots the Gundam even though he's not supposed to, and because of that he experiences a lot of death and destruction at a way too young age.  Then after the first timeskip he passes that trauma onto his son, Asemu, whom he essentially brainwashed to help him get revenge for the death of his childhood friend, and he did the same thing again to his grandkid later on in the series.  Asemu is also depicted as what happens if you don't nurture talent and and potential properly.        I'm a sucker for new ideas even if they don't work out well.  And they...really didn't work out that great in AGE. A series that actually shows us the consequences of generational trauma and warfare definitely seems like a good fit for a series like Gundam, but it just kind of falls apart in practice. We're really just left with a few miniseries that are loosely threaded together and greatly uneven in tone and quality. I don't think I'm going to be the only person to say that Flit's arc was pretty well done, but virtually everything else really lacks in comparison, often being too rushed or spread too thin. It clearly needed more time to tell the story it wanted to tell, but by the same token, I really can't find myself wanting to sit through even more of the show. The fact that they originally greenlit 75 episodes is astonishing to me.        I'm also not a huge fan of most of the Mobile Suit design. I liked the early Vagan ones, but whole 3D printed evolving Gundam thing just seemed really dumb to me. Some MS are better than others, but I can't say I really love any of them. Likewise, I don't even remember most of the soundtrack, which probably isn't a stellar recommendation. Rounding things out, most of the characters and writing are pretty unimpressive.  Another good example is in the third half when Kio spends some time with the enemies and befriends this guy and his..I think sister? Honestly I don't remember if they're related or just friends, but anyways that's another example  of a plot point that didn't have enough time to be fleshed out as well as it should have been.        The biggest problem is that it focuses on the less interesting things a lot of time, while the most interesting aspect of the story and the most interesting characters don't get enough attention.  It's frustrating.  That's proven because I found a good portion of the series to be boring.  It was mostly dull with occasional moments of unfulfilled intrigue.  I think some of the vitriol that gets spouted about AGE might be a little excessive, but ""it's not completely terrible"" is still pretty faint praise.",anime,1ko6wh3

They feel like battle p*rn and because there is no character or story build up i just  dont care about the fights even though they are incredibly animated.

"[Rewatch] Shin Sekai Yori Rewatch - Episode 11 Discussion **Episode 11: Distant Thunder in Winter**  [Prior Episode]( | [Index]( | Next Episode  ***  **Links/Information:**  [MAL]( | [AniList]( | [ANN]( | [Kitsu]( | [AniDB](  **Streams/How Do I Watch It?**  Alas, no legal streams for this one, you'll have to use alternative means.  ***  **Spoiler Policy:** Please be cautious of spoiling any first timers. Any discussion of events that occur in future episodes are required to be hidden under a spoiler tag. Also please refrain from any ""laugh as rewatcher"" or other type of behavior that while not outright spoiling something, implies a spoiler.  ***  **Production/Background Information:**  Today let's talk about **Masashi Sogo**, who not only wrote today's episode but also holds the role of Series Composition. He writes 14 of the show's 25 episodes, more than double of any other writer on the show. He had previously written episodes 1 - 3, 7 and 10 and will write episodes 12 - 13, 16 and the final 5 episodes. He started his career writing the script for some OVAs including Dr. Typphoon and D-1 Devastator in the early 90s before making his series composition debut with the show Shadow Skill: Eigi in 1998. He's soon after do two seasons of Nippon-ichi no Otoko no Tamashi, as well as a Rurouni Kenshin OVA and the TV show Great Teacher Onizuka. It looks like similar to Shin Sekai Yori, most of his work is done as an adapter (although typically manga rather than a novel). The years 1998 - 2002 are really prolific for him, with him also contributing scripts for a number of episodes of Hunter x Hunter, Yu Gi Oh and the Prince of Tennis, a show that was considerable in length (75 episodes) and he also acted in the series composition role for. He'd continue in the series composition role for anime such as Gantz, Bleach and Fairy Tail and would also contribute some Pokemon episodes for the ""Diamond & Pearl"" season. In the years before Shin Sekai Yori he primarily worked on a number of Break Blade movies as well as some more work on the Fairy Tail franchise, both of which he'd return to once Shin Sekai Yori was finished. His output seems to have slowed the last few years, with the last credited work of his I see on Digimon Ghost Game in 2021.  **Seiyuu of the Day**  Today I am going to cover the new character and ""fake"" member of Group One, **Ryou**. He is voiced by **Ryota Ohsaka**. He has a couple of lead roles including Haruto in Valvrave and Nagate in Knights of Sidonia. Other notable roles of his include Hush Middy in Mobile Suit Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans, Ryouta Watari in Your Lie in April, Klim Nick in Gundam Reconguista in G, Marco Bodt in Attack on Titan, Billy Hickman in Gundam Thunderbolt, Yuuma Isogai in Assassination Classrom, Yosuke Hirata in Classroom of the Elite and Klancain in Aldnoah Zero. He's also got a couple of roles in the Code Geass spinoffs Akito the Exiled and Roze of the Recapture.  ***  **Questions of the Day**  1) This episode has the students needing to pair up. How would you have paired up our characters?  2) If you were Saki what questions would you have asked Ryou to see if he was really part of their group all along?  3) Any theories for why the Head of the Ethics Committee has called in Saki, Satoru and Maria?  **Tomorrow's Questions of the Day**  I will post these via a separate comment after watching the next episode.",anime,1knkoo2

If it’s like “monogatari series” they seem to ignore sequels, movies and OVAs too.

This cuts out any romance or harem anime (harem is probably my least favorite genre tbh).  I don't want something with 200+ episodes.  I prefer older female protagonists (i.e. not high school girls, lol). As a kid I loved shows like Bubblegum Crisis and Rayearth, or that movie Perfect Blue. The last new show I watched was Jormungand, loved that too.   I like dark and psychological stories, don't mind blood/gore. But I also love stupid comedy. Azumanga Daioh is one I consistently rewatch over the years.  The newer the better, as I've definitely seen a metric butt-ton of older anime. My partner watches a lot more anime than I do, so I've been exposed to things like Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen, and other really popular ones without actively watching them. Not looking for those types.  Appreciate any suggestions, because browsing Crunchy Roll yesterday ended up in me watching nothing!",anime,1ko2cvr
"Just finished Made in Abyss… I wasn’t ready. I went in expecting another beautifully animated adventure anime. What I got was a rollercoaster of pain, wonder, and existential dread wrapped in a deceptively cute art style.  The worldbuilding is insane, the OST haunts me (Kevin Penkin is a genius),,,, and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since the final episode.  Seriously, how do you all cope after finishing something like this? Any other anime that hit you just as hard?  (P.S. Please no manga spoilers,, I'm still emotionally recovering.)",anime,1kmxhfh
"Tip of my tongue Hey! I can remember an anime scene so vaguely but can‘t really recall the title. I watched this on Animax channel around 2014(?) maybe. But there is one specific scene where one character was fighting someone that later turns into a plant like monster with vines and thorns. In the end the character got stabbed by the thorns and died, and he/she turned into many white flowers that fly accross the world and one landed one someone laying on the floor.  Any speculations on what this might be are appreciated!  Thanks",anime,1knm7yz

"Trying to find this anime - But can't remember the name. Hey, I remember watching a clip years ago of an anime with a boy who has messy brown hair and wears a school uniform. During the day, he used to act pretty normal, maybe even a bit shy, but there’s a scene late at night where he’s sitting alone by a river or lake, staring at the water with a really intense, emotional expression. Suddenly, he punches a nearby wall or something hard out of frustration or sadness. Someone might be watching him secretly, and after that, he tries to hide his feelings and act calm again. The story felt very deep and personal.   Does this sound familiar to anyone?",anime,1knsmuk
"Need anime name of mid 90s scifi monster series starting with the letter K. Hello, I’m looking for the Japanese name of an anime show I remember watching back in the mid-90s, but I've forgotten the full name of it. I know it started with a K, had a U, a Y, and two J’s. I remember the title being a long, singular one. I can give a brief synopsis of the show since I enjoyed it a lot and would love to rewatch it:   A clumsy high school girl is caught in the middle of monsters (I couldn't tell you what type) while a mysterious man with the ability to grow spikes or blades from his arms befriends and even falls in love with her. He also fights the monsters and allies with the military, I think.

"I'm trying to find a anime The anime is about a guy who has an organization, like a bounty hunter, like Dante and Devil May Cry. The protagonist has a sort of assistant who helps him using a drone. I remember that the helper has something to do with numbers. In one of the episodes I remember the protagonist being in a kind of plane with weapons to fight against something. In another episode, the protagonist helps to unmask a woman who pretends to be nice. In another episode, the protagonist helps a guy find his childhood friends who were infected by animals (insects) and turned into them, but giant, his friends played bug fight.

"Can anyone recommend shows with mature characters? As I've gotten older (currently I'm 25), I've been finding it easier to relate to characters in university or the professional world. For example I watched ""Sing Yesterday For Me"" and it was one of the best slice of life shows I've ever seen. That said, if I was still in high school and tried to watch it, my enjoyment would probably have been a lot less. Now I'm wondering what shows I may have missed growing up that had an adult cast that I would enjoy now.  I want to clarify I think there are multiple ways for a character to be mature. They could be adults, but if a character actually ages throughout a show and shows character growth I think that's so much fun to watch as well.   Shows I've liked with adult cast: - How I Attended an All Guys Mixer - Sing Yesterday For Me - I Have a Crush at Work - The Daily Life of a Middle Aged Online Shopper - Spice and Wolf (I haven't seen the remake but enjoyed the original way back when) - Uzaki chan Wants to Hang Out  Shows I've liked with juvenile, but mature cast: - Horimiya - Toradora - Blue Box - Tonikawa: Over the Moon For You",anime,1kmzer5
"JJk - Just because two guys are emotionally destroyed over each other doesn’t mean they’re dating, bruh If this isn’t allowed, mods feel free to delete—but I wanted to share a personal take on Gojo & Geto’s dynamic that I don’t see enough of.  Imma rant. So bear with me.  Yo, I’m a gay guy. And yeh, I know the fanfics dropped before the bodies even hit the floor. Still. Hear me out. Gojo and Geto ain't gay for eachother. Just tragic as hell. The manga makes this pretty fckn clear. More so than the anime even, imo.  Ppl see two dudes with actual emotional range and suddenly it’s like, “Omg soulmates??” Nah. Sometimes it’s just two ppl who were everything to each other and then tore each other apart. You don’t need romance to explain why that wrecked them. That’s just grief, bruh. That’s guilt. That’s ""I couldn’t save you, and now I gotta live with it"" energy.  It hits different because it’s real. Not flirty. Not romantic - ironically, that would've lowered the emotional stakes.  Just two men who believed in each other too hard, too fast, and broke under the weight of it, under impossible circumstances, no less.  Some of you haven’t had a real ride-or-die in your life and it shows.  Let men be close. Let them cry, rage, collapse—without slapping a ship on it just to make the emotion feel valid. Brotherhood runs deep. And when it breaks, it can gut you way worse than love ever could.  And yeah, if you still wanna ship them, go wild. Just don’t act like it’s the only way to read it.

"I've seen hundreds of anime shows and I believe Dennou Coil is the single most underrated anime of all time. I'm on my third rewatch of the series (I own it on bluray) and each time I'm amazed by it. It's a great sci-fi show (not only anime) and in a similar way than Serial Experiments Lain I think this was ahead of it's time. Funny enough we are close to 2026, the year when the anime takes place, because there's a lot here I see happening with the current technology.   The main story is captivating but the stand alone episodes are also a lot of fun. The characters are charming and has a very diverse cast of characters. It also has a good sense of atmosphere, I'm not sure how to describe it, but when I watch Dennou Coil I feel a mix of cute nostalgia but also a sense of melancholy. It has that charm of a kids show, but with a mature eye behind it (and it certainly touches a lot of dark themes).   It's also the ONLY anime series I've ever seen that have made me cry.

"Looking for a complete anime with a real ending — no manga required, no open/ambiguous finales I’m looking for an anime (even long or well-known) that tells a complete and finished story — no need to read the manga to get closure.

I don’t mind if it’s long (even over 100+ episodes), as long as the story actually ends and feels narratively complete.  Please avoid recommending:  anime with open-ended, symbolic, or confusing finales,  adaptations that only cover part of the manga or were never finished,  reboots or poorly executed adaptations,  shows that rely on reading the manga to fully understand the plot or reach the end,  Bonus points if the anime has solid animation, good direction, and a memorable soundtrack, but story quality comes first.

Yes yes, I know that the guys at r/SeishunButaYarou also doing this, but in accordance with the TV rebroadcast, which is weekly, but we will do it daily. I welcome all of you who are participating there as well. This is not about competition, or distract/redirect people from there, but peaceful coexistence.  And you’re going to love this choice of mine.  # About the series:  Rascal Does Not Dream is a LN series made by the duo of Hajime Kamoshida (writer) and Keiji Mizoguchi (illustrator). This duo made the The Pet Girl of Sakurasou together before that. The LN series had 15 volumes overall from 2014 to 2024. Obviously it has a manga version, but from multiple illustrators, which overall had 11 volumes starting from late 2015. Then it was adapted into anime as well, under the name Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai. The series was produced by the then newbie studio Cloverworks, which was one of the first (and major) works they worked on. Director is Soichi Masui and written by Masahiro Yokotani, the music by Fox Capture Plan. It was aired in Fall 2018, from October 4 to December 27, for 13 episodes. Shortly after, in 2019, this TV series was followed by the first movie, Rascal Does Not Dream of a Dreaming Girl. Then in 2023, two more followed up: Rascal Does Not Dream of a Sister Venturing Out and Knapsack Kid (with a few months difference). These are covering the entire High School Student Arc. And now, in July it is continued by the second series (for certain reason I don’t use the term season here) Rascal Does Not Dream of a Santa Claus, which is basically the University Student Arc and probably that could be the road towards a complete adaption.  # More info:  The series: [MAL]( | [Anilist]( | [Anidb]( | [Kitsu]( | [Livechart]( | [AP]( | [Wikipedia](  Dreaming Girl: [MAL]( | [Anilist]( | [Anidb]( | [Kitsu]( | [Livechart]( | [AP]( | [Wikipedia](  Sister Venturing Out: [MAL]( | [Anilist]( | [Anidb]( | [Kitsu]( | [Livechart]( | [AP]( | [Wikipedia](  Knapsack Kid: [MAL]( | [Anilist]( | [Anidb]( | [Kitsu]( | [Livechart]( | [AP]( | [Wikipedia](  # The main synopsis:  Sakuta Azusagawa, is an ordinary highschooler. Until the day, he meets teenage actress and upperclassman Mai Sakurajima, dressed up in a bunny suit, in the school library. For some reason he is the only who notices her presence. The reason is a mysterious phenomenon called as the Adolescence Syndrome (or Puberty Syndrome), which nobody knows its truth. Sakuta undertakes a quest to find the truth behind this mystery, but in order to move forward, he must get to closer to Mai, and some other girls who suffer from this same ""disorder"" and must know himself as well.  # Why did I chose this series and organizing a rewatch? And why you should watch this?  1) It is popular, successful and well-known. More like I ask the question: who didn’t heard about this? You might noticed this, this has one of the most clickbaity titles of all time, and that is not a bad thing. But instead, it is quite different and that reflects what it is about. A plot twist if one could say that. Outside it looks like normal, but inside it is much deeper and huge mysteries lies within. And this is the reason why it works so well. It is held in high-regard, is a subject and/or mentioned in discussions, rightfully compared with other shows like the Monogatari Series, Oregairu, Haruhi or even Kokoro Connect. Made by a good named studio and a strong cast worked on it, a very catchy OP song, a deep and complex and well-written story with good characters, with a strong identity, of course the anime elevated the source material into new heights. So you have a winning recipe.  2) If you think that supernatural, psychological, (pseudo)science, romance and harem-like can work together. It may look a mishmash, but trust me, the chemistry (good joke haha) of these combinations work together, and in a very coherent way. And do wonders.  3) If you want some ""losing heroines"" in action. You can get my joke what I talking about and understanding the story this will be clear as well. It has many popular, well-known and beloved female characters and they are regular participants this subs annual best girl competition, who can achieve good positions.  4) Recency. The last known (and the only one) rewatch here was back from 2021/12/27 to 2022/01/09, by the courtesy of u/Splitter_Triplets. Which was (obviously) covered until Dreaming Girl. In my case, Sister Venturing Out and Knapsack Kid will be included too, because those two were released in 2023, and the two films was not part of any rewatch (because nobody hosted this series). So it was about time.  5) The cast. Man, it is stacked, even for 2025 standards. Ishikawa Kaito, Seto Asami, Kubo Yurika, Touyama Nao, Tanezaki Atsumi, Minase Inori and Uchida Maaya. Bro, that is the main cast. And you have Ueda Reina for the Miniskirt Santa as well. Plus many well known names even for the supporting cast. And it is paired with the fact all the VAs performing the ending song as their characters, just like in the Monogatari Series. So there you have it, no complaints. No offense, dub bros.  6) The second series is coming and sooner than you thought. The new series will cover the University Student Arc and that is called Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus, and start in this July. Rewatchers who want to refresh their memories and want to give a shot one more time and first timers who are interested in by the simple existence of the sequel, or just want to watch something, or whatever your reasons are, then this is the best opportunity to start.  7) Personal reasons. To be honest, I planned to watch that again in this year (preferably in Spring) because of the second series, just to be sure when will air. And I thought, hosting here in this sub is even better for this, as a reason to justify. Especially a particular show which I made for my rewatch hosting scheduling plan for 2025. As for organizing, I felt it. I like doing something if I feel the most. The AnimeJapan announcement was the first major reason why I want to do this (I expressed my thoughts on that news post there). Another major reason is I want something big, something that everyone likes, which could gain a large traction. And lastly the feedback and experience gained from my Toshokan Sensou and Joshiraku hostings earlier.  # Where can I watch it?  [Crunchyroll]( [bilibili]( [Hulu]( has it, atleast the first series. As for the movies, it has the notorious reputation that no legal way available. Sister Venturing Out and Knapsack Kid has basically nothing. But Dreaming Girl is [on bilibili]( though.  [Aniplex, why?](#sadholo)  # Schedule  The initial plan is I would start on June 5. Regarding episodes one per day, so this could end in June 17. As for the movies we would take one day breaks in order to watch it. 19-21-23 are the days when the respective discussion posts will be posted. Final discussion on 24. The threads will be live on 22:00 CET/13:00 PST/16:00 EST.  # What I can say more?  To be honest, I was one of the many who firmly believed this would aired in Fall, because that is the most appropriate for the Christmas season (Miniskirt Santa and stuff). But no, they had to put to Summer, which is the most stacked season we’ve had (but why?). For the initial late Summer-early Fall plan, I would have organized back in August-September, and had to swap with another show which I planned in my schedule. Regarding that, the only clue I can give about is that will be an interesting choice. Original plan was May but, instead hosted Joshiraku to fill the originally allocated timeslot. I came to the point where I placed to June instead because to make it more closer to the second series start, the more hype and attention might receive, which means ot could have more people interested. But this will not affect my plans for July though.  If I manage to get sufficient comments/interests here within 48 or 72 hours, then I will commence it. But if not, then I resort to plan B, selecting an alternative choice which you might also love. Or third choice, no rewatch going to happen from me until July.  Free feel to join, because I accept all of you with open arms. And also have a good time here.",anime,1kmp8ic

"Rewatching Darling in the Franxx after 7 years... </3 Any love for this series still out there? I remember watching this show so much younger and so much has changed for me in the time in between. Now I have 2 children and have been with my partner over 10 years.  We originally watched it together, at their request despite the fact that (as of this morning) they swear it was my idea. I'm rewatching it alone now, since I think the ending killed it for my partner.  I don't care, the journey is as good as I remember it being. I've forgotten most of the scenes, and all of the main characters (children) seem much younger than I remember, which makes sense. Everything is hitting so hard... the intro song just rips me up anytime I hear it.  I can't remember if I watched the show originally subbed or dubbed, since both voices for Hiro and Zero Two seem to fit so well. Now I'm currently rewatching it mostly subbed on Crunchyroll, but I find myself rewatching ever scene with Zero Two dubbed into English because the main VA did such a good job.  Has anyone else gone back to this show recently or remember it as fondly as I did/do? I saw that AniDB gave this show and 5/10 and the audience around a 6.5/10, while AniList has it at 7.2. Don't know what to make of that score difference, except that I remember when this series came out the internet was swarming with Zero Two for a long while... I haven't seen anything about this series in a while now.  Has everyone move on from this heartbreak or has it all been replaced by Edgerunners, without the Gainex ending?  edit: got my original post auto-removed for posting a picture of Zero Two smiling with my post.

"Just finished watching Frieren. Need something new. Just finished watching Frieren and though I'll need a week or two to process the fact that this season is over, I'm thinking about what to catch next.  Watched Zenshu and loved it. Before that it was Ranking of Kings - and I stopped when it got draggy in the second season. Loved Cowboy Bebop, but that's not saying anything. And Violet Evergarden.  I personally think Konosuba is a little bit more high brow than people give it credit for (that being said, it's not THAT high of a bar to clear) and HS DxD starts more compelling than it deserves (again, low bar) despite the bewbage, until it isnt somewhere into the 2nd-ish season. Love anything by Trigger. Zom 100 is fun, but my Netflix ran out before finishing it and now it's stuck in watching limbo and I'm not sure I'm up for continuing - looking back it's not anywhere as powerful as Frieren is, or as conceptually as Zenshu (sure i might be giving both series more credit than they deserve, but they were goooood).

It was so sad. Watching everyone die the way they did, and Lucy all alone on the moon. I get that that’s the point of the whole anime, that it’s not supposed to be a happy ending. But brutally realistic. But these past days I’ve felt such extreme emotion, which I assume is because I’ve never seen a show like this ever. This is the first ever show to make me cry. But it’s also put me in a really sad state of mind. Sometimes even at school I think about how it ended, and just how sad it is that everyone died the way they did. Is this normal to feel?

It's also a reminder of how much the anime landscape has changed in the last 30 years, and a lot of that is due to ADV.  It's a shame we don't get trailers like this any more. The fact is companies just don't sell anime anymore. Weebs either pirate it or subscribe to streaming services.  It's a shame. Things like the Evangelion teaser are so iconic to a certain generation. Here is the full thing if you haven't seen it   While our access to anime is so much greater, I really think we have lost something along the way. Anime has become so much more consumable now.

"About kumo desuga nani ka? story, timeline and ending. Please help me out and enlighten me. Spoiler ahead***  I'm kind of confuse on this story, I just finished the last episode and found out that Kumoko and Shun story isn't happening in the same timeline  On the last episode, Shun discovered or recognised that the white hair girl is Wakaba, but then online says that ""that"" white hair girl isn't kumoko.  But on Kumoko story, demon lord and kumoko had a truce and asked kumoko to join to beat potimas  Okay so that part really confuses me out. If The person Shun discovered to be white hair girl as wakaba then where's Kumoko? if they're in the same universe but different timeline, why is there 2 Wakaba? The one I found online says that Kumoko is still in the labyrinth and still trying to get more stronger.    From all this confusing stuff. Let me say this from what I understand, which correctly me if I'm wrong. Kumoko story is supposed to be the past timeline and Shun is supposed to be the present. The white hair girl Shun thinks to be wakaba is kumoko. Is this right? Although I tried to search for it and it says I was wrong.

Now I remember that there actually was an anime based on the first game that was pretty good, if not underrated as well (kinda like Power Stone, in general). So it got me thinking about anime based on other Capcom titles that maybe I might have missed. So what do you all consider to be the best Capcom anime?

"What's your honest opinion on the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist? For me personally... for an anime that went it's own direction because the manga wasn't finished, it was surprisingly good... Sure, it will never be better than Brotherhood, but I really like what the anime writers did... and there was a follow-up movie that kinda introduced our world using the world building established so it didn't feel outta nowhere, and it's much better than the multiverse slop we see today.  Also, the first series was a lot darker and certain things really scared me. For example, Edward and Alphonse's teacher has a tragic story in both versions, but I found it particularly creepier in the 2003 version. And there's a lot more.",anime,1klvzbw

(Japanese only, since dub actors would probably need a different post) By ""non-professional voice actors"", I mean they only don't do voice acting as their main job, and would do it as their side job. Usually these ""non-professional voice actors"" are live action actors, stage actors or even sometimes a comedian.  You can see various examples of this in most Studio Ghibli movies, or many other feature films that are not a part of an existing franchise, where usually a popular actor or actress is cast as the lead voice actor of the movie.

I think the main character is young woman, with a circular glass talisman on the back of her hand, they have flying scooter vehicles and the story includes gigantic, floating larvae looking monsters, with golden colored cilia/fuzzy hair coming out of their bodies.

"My Thoughts on Mobile Suit Gundam 00 This is for both seasons of the anime plus the movie Awakening the Trailblazer.      This one was pretty good.  I don't think it was anywhere close to the best installment in the franchise so far, but it's nowhere close to the worst either, in my opinion.  It's perfectly middle of the road when compared to the other Gundam installments that I've seen so far, and that's not meant to be an insult.  Considering the worst of this series consists of near trash like Superior Defender Gundam Force, and the best is the original Mobile Suit Gundam and debatably the first season of Mobile Suit Gundam Seed, and few installments, especially ones that go this long, are straight up terrible, this series being middle of the road still makes it pretty entertaining.        This series takes place in yet another new timeline, called the Anno Domini timeline, or AD timeline.  And you guessed it, both seasons plus the movie of this series are the only anime that take place in this timeline, although there some light novels and manga that expand on this timeline.  But anyways, like usual, the technical stuff is all improved here, especially the animation, art, and fight scenes.  That's especially the case in the movie.  But that makes sense though because it is a movie, not to mention one that came out in 2010, only 15 years ago.  We're getting into the more recent Gundam now, relatively speaking anyways.  And even the two seasons of the anime are somewhat recent by comparison to the older installments, as they aired from 2007-2009.        Like the best Gundam series, this anime has themes that includes war, and also more minor themes like love and friendship, which are intertwined with its anti war themes.  There were times when the execution of these themes could get slightly cheesy, but not enough to completely ruin the series for me.  The first half of the show was a bit slow, although it was never boring.  But it was the second half the show where it got super engrossing, and towards the very end of the show even tragic, which is what a lot of people would probably expect from a Gundam anime.  I do think the movie was unnecessary, but it still wasn't bad.",anime,1kmv28e

"[Rewatch] Shin Sekai Yori Rewatch - Episode 9 Discussion **Episode 9: The Rising Wind**  [Prior Episode]( | [Index]( | [Next Episode](  ***  **Links/Information:**  [MAL]( | [AniList]( | [ANN]( | [Kitsu]( | [AniDB](  **Streams/How Do I Watch It?**  Alas, no legal streams for this one, you'll have to use alternative means.  ***  **Spoiler Policy:** Please be cautious of spoiling any first timers. Any discussion of events that occur in future episodes are required to be hidden under a spoiler tag. Also please refrain from any ""laugh as rewatcher"" or other type of behavior that while not outright spoiling something, implies a spoiler.  ***  **Production/Background Information:**  Given that today's episode really impressed me with the overall atmosphere I figured I'd look into who was responsible for the episode! The episode was storyboarded by Nobutoshi Ogura. He had previously storyboarded episodes 4 and 7 and has four more episodes later on in the show. Reviewing his MAL profile makes it quite obvious that he has a history working at Gainax during its prime, he was a key animator for several episodes of Evangelion and worked on End of Evangelion. He debuted as a storyboarder with His and Her Circumstances and was responsible for the storyboards, animation direction and setting for episode 4 of FLCL. He's also got a lot of work associated with Hiroyuki Imaishi and Trigger, both before and after that studio's founding including Dead Leaves, Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, Kill la Kill, Little Witch Academia, Space Patrol Luluco, Kiznaiver and Promare. He's also worked as a storyboarder on Full Metal Panic, Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex, Darling in the Franxx and Dungeon Meshi.  The episode's director was Yuuta Nakamura. This was his only episode directing the show. He's got a lengthy resume of directing individual anime episodes, although oddly enough not from any other anime I've seen. He's directed individual episodes on shows like Chihayafuru, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Medaka Box, Naruto, Pokémon and other stuff although typically just for a single episode. His only Chief Director role is for Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable, a 39 episode TV show from 9 years ago.  **Seiyuu of the Day**  Today's seiyuu of the day is **Motoki Takagi**, the new seiyuu for **Mamoru Itou**. I've only personally heard him in one other role, Souya in Mawaru Penguindrum. While he's not prolific, his voice was memorable enough that I was able to recognize him when I participated in the Penguindrum rewatch last year. Research tells me other major roles of his include Furusato in Senjuushi, Renji in ef: A Tale of Melodies, Raki in Claymore, Uruno in Damekko Doubutsu and the young version of Miroku in Inu Yasha.  ***  **Questions of the Day**  1) Do you think today's episode did a good job setting forth a dark, scary atmosphere?  2) What do you think caused that crater to appear?   3) What should Saki do to survive this encounter with the Tainted Cat?  **Tomorrow's Questions of the Day**  I will post these via a separate comment after watching the next episode.",anime,1klyqwb

Need help identifying an anime I recall seeing a clip a bit ago but don't remember the name of the show.  From what I remember the scene goes like this:  A guy (maybe a wizard/mage) walks into a jail cell where someone in a full set of armor is there waiting (they might be chained up I don't remember). The guy reaches down to the helm of the armor and the helm dissolves revealing a woman under the helmet (she might be crying I'm not 100% on that).   I think the dude used magic at some point and the whole clip MIGHT be about him showing the girl kindness or something. Pretty sure this whole scene is at night as well. I also think someone else came into the cell or at least waited outside the cell. The vibe is obviously fantasy and maybe even isekai.  That's all I remember from the clip.,anime,1kmd5ls

"Was bored so decided to list out my GOATs after over 500 completed animes (Based on MAL genres) Was doing a bit of cleanup on MyAnimeList (MAL) and thinking about how I personally like to keep my 10/10s very restrictive. Essentially, there can only be one GOAT for a genre in a way - though genres themselves are kinda funky and subjective and arbitrary with how they are assigned sometimes (Assassination Classroom is so much more than Action/Comedy for example).  I figured I would list out my current GOATs as I'd be curious to see some similar lists from anybody else. Maybe get some hidden gem recommendations. All listed are 10/10 unless specified otherwise - recommend me something better!  \-  MAL Genre list:  \#1 Action - Attack on Titan / Black Lagoon (both 9/10)  \#1 Adventure - Made in Abyss  \#1 Avant Garde - Revue Starlight (8/10)  \#1 Comedy - KonoSuba  \#1 Drama - Clannad  \#1 Fantasy - Berserk (Redux fanedit is 10/10)  \#1 Gourmet - Food Wars (8/10)  \#1 Horror - Higurashi: When They Cry (8/10)  \#1 Mystery - Shinsekai Yori (From the New World)  \#1 Romance - Toradora  \#1 Scifi - Vivy: Flourite Eye's Song  \#1 Slice of Life - K-ON  \#1 Sports - Keijo!!!!!!!!!!

"My thoughts on smart phone isekai anime So recently I binged smartphone isekai. And if you know me you know I tried multiple times on this anime and couldn’t get past episode 3. Because it was so generic and boring and slow. However, today I had a day off and someone recommended me to put it on in the background and just listen and only come back to it when something seemed interesting. Normally I would just ignore someone telling me to do that but this person knows me and my taste extremely well and said there would be something in the anime I would like/find interesting. And to a degree they were correct. Now while this anime has a butt load of generic actions and generic isekai concepts, one concept that was nearly unique to me that universally gets ignored with the exception of one or two anime I can think of is the concept of a harem and making time for each girl and balancing your harem and your isekai duties. And unlike the previously suggested anime that tackle this concept the smartphone isekai tackles this idea entirely more in depth than any other anime I’ve seen. Giving a personality to each girl and making each girl have a say in who joins the harem and all of them even are sentient, saying they don’t get to see him often other than in passing when the isekai duties begin to take up most of his day to day. I would even argue by the second season the main plot is the mc managing and interacting with his harem and the side plot is the world ending/cataclysmic things going on. One point that I had a love hate relationship with was Babylon. The concept that an ancient civilization that was super advanced enough to make flying islands and trials to become owner of the islands is definitely an interesting concept. The main plot point of it is 5/7 of trials were needlessly horny as shit and felt like they were written by a man going through puberty. Not to mention the dna biometric confirmation being done through a kiss instead of him simply giving them a hair is uncalled for. After the first time if he really didn’t want the kiss you would think he would just give them a hair or interact differently but he doesn’t. Overall while there are definite problems with this anime I would personally give it a 6.5 out of 10.",anime,1kmkvnv
"Handyman Saito really impressed me I never know if I should mark as spoiler older shows but I try to err on the side of caution.   I started it a couple of times & never got past 3rd episode because of the snippet format. As everyone now knows it uses this to establish the unrelated chars but shifts into a more coherent standard narrative episode 4 or 5. I found it nostalgic when they flipped back into it in the last episode.   Just finished the series (which I’m sure everyone else finished years ago). Gotta say after the usual OP MC isekai this really stands out. It’s moved up into my top 10 anime & top 5 isekai.  As much as I loved it I’m not really burning for a S02. It told the story well without lots of open challenges & I’m content to not ruin it with a bad S02.   The writing avoids just about every fantasy & isekai trope. Really well written. Color me impressed. The animation is also good, not the more common still pictures with lip movement you see so often now or a lazy mix of 2D & 3D animation.   When I started it I assumed it would be just another “the weakest turned out to be the strongest” yawner. Really surprised; Saito’s growth isn’t into a super powerful fighter but as a person feeling appreciated. Every single character doesn’t fit the standard archetypes, from ninja to dwarf to elf to demon. Sometimes the difference is intentional juxtaposition (you see the staff & massive axe & assume the big scarred guy wields the axe & the little lady the staff). Morlock & Saito working together - I can’t recall a fantasy show where the wizard forgets spells in combat & the supporter reminds him. The skinflint fairy, the dwarf mage, the emotionally uncertain tank, all drawn as unique characters challenging our preconceptions. I especially enjoyed the backstory of the fused demon brothers. Mom on the wall was chilling & suitably demonic.   I was expecting another Campfire Cooking or Farming Life in Another World. This was the most pleasant surprise I’ve had since Frieren.",anime,1klev1w

Some info: it centers around this girl with black/dark hair, it's in this apocalyptic world where she and a small group use mecha suits to fight off these dark grey creatures, the mecha suits are not huge like some other animes but just enough for combat and easy transportation, their main mode of transport was by train, she finds this white haired dude who can transform his arms and/or body into blades which was looked down upon by normal humans and can fight against these creatures really well, he becomes a love interest/body guard and at the end of the anime she sacrifices herself to save mankind through this mechanical contraption and is implied that she became a star or shooting star idk. Small detail she was with a group who were irrelevant really but had this older dude with blond hair and a beard who was like a mentor/bodyguard before the white haired dude showed up and she may have been some kind of royalty.

"Need Help Remembering An Anime \*\*\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*\*\*\*  So memory is a funny thing and it combined a few things from a few different animes I was watching at the time. Also apparently it was VRV because the anime is licensed to HIdive and was renewed during that time period.   Anime is.... Princess Ressurection (2007)    \*\*\*\*\*Original\*\*\*\*\*\*  Ok, so I have the credit sequence for an anime that some girl got me to watch like 5 years ago. I can't remember much of the actual anime. I know it was an English dub (visually impaired I can't read subs in time with the show), I either watched it on Funimation, VRV, or Hidive.   What I think I remember is the anime is about a blonde highschool guy that is basically surrounded by women. I can't remember if they live with him or not. And most of them are like older than him? Maybe? I do know there is a supporting cast of like 3+ women. I also know one is like a dark skinned sporty type with either dark brown or red hair.   Anyway, I remember the credits because for some reason it runs through my head. It basically shows the girls doing different things in a room it's got tatmi mat floors and a table. Either they're sitting at the table, dancing, or eating etc.  One scene the room is like a light green, and it has a side view of the ""regal"" one of the girls sitting at a table sipping tea from a side view. And another shot has the dark skinned sporty character wearing like baggy khanki colored pants, and a red halter tank top. She does some hip hop dance, and gets on her knees. Then she's supposed to be wiggling her hips or something but it looks weird so it's almost like she has a mini seizure.   That's pretty much all I can remember. I know it's like modernist digital style art.  And I know it was like summer of 2020 when I watched it so it wouldn't be newer than that. My hopes are that if I rewatch the anime it will get the credit sequence out of my head. Because it literally just pops into it at random times like an earwig.   Fair warning it could be an ecchi. The girl who suggested it to me also suggested Highschool DxD, Testament of Sister New Devil, Hensuki, etc. Why yes, she does frequent the ""Okay hear me out"" section and Barnes and Nobles why do you ask? Seriously though any ideas or assistance on what it might be would be fantastic and appreciated.",anime,1km3ese

(2) The quiet boy is friends with a girl in another cabin, and they bump into eachother at night going to the bathroom and chat. One of the guys from the quiet boys cabin wanders over and the girl hides as to not make their friendship look suspicious. They chat and then the guy then opens up to the quiet boy about his feelings for the girl not realising she can hear. (3) The quiet boy is assumed to have fallen from a cliff - in this moment the girl then realises her feelings for the quiet boy (not entirely sure if thats right?) - the quiet boy was fine and the girl was just misinformed.  I have no recollection of when or where I watched it, and I've googled so many things to try and find it I'm half convinced I dreamt it! So if anyone has the faintest idea just so I'm not stuck thinking about it for the next week you'd be a godsend :)",anime,1km01qe

"Should You Watch It? Spring 2025 #[Should You Watch It? Spring 2025](  Hello! Every season we’re met with around 50 new shows, making it difficult to know which shows are worth your time. This is why we submit to you a Should You Watch It Spring 2025 edition! This post is based on the series formerly run by /u/BanjoTheBear, and will follow the same general formatting. This post is brought to you by the /r/anime Awards Off Season team, a group of volunteers focused on creating high effort content.  Our metric is based watching the first three episodes (more in the case of this season!) of every premiere and judging them via these four options:   Drop It – save yourselves the time and just drop it.   Consider It - watch it if you enjoy the genre or wait until it is completed, though even then you may not enjoy it.   Watch It – should be a grand old time and appeal to most everyone in one form or another.   Must Watch - if you are not watching this as it airs, you are seriously missing out. #[Anne Shirley]( ###/u/drjwilson - Must Watch If it's been a long day and I'm at my limit, it's nice to be reminded that brightness exists in the world. This season's brightness is Anne Shirley—the show and the person. When she appears, both you the viewer, and the characters lucky enough to inhabit her world, are whisked away to a fantastical place of Anne's imagining. We first meet Anne as an orphan being adopted, but more importantly, we see that Anne is a girl who *feels*. Whether that be flights of whimsy, unbridled joy, or inconsolable sadness—Anne wears her heart on her sleeve.   The name ""Anne Shirley"" doesn't come lightly. Anne of Green Gables is one of the best selling novels of our time and beloved worldwide. It also spawned the 1978 anime of the same name, written by Isao Takahata of Studio Ghibli fame, working alongside Hayao Miyazaki. Certainly, Anne Shirley has gargantuan shoes to fill. But I believe that it does.  While I hesitate to call any great work ""updated"" for our modern times, Anne Shirley is visually impressive. The animation is lively and fluid, almost as bright and bouncy as Anne. With talented animators and strong bones, Anne Shirley is firing on all cylinders. There’s a reason why the adventures of Anne have long captured folk's imaginations for over 100 years. She's someone you can root for. ###/u/collapsedblock6 - Consider It Anne of Green Gables already had an adaptation in the 70s, so Anne Shirley is being called a 'remake'. Due to this, it is hard to separate the experience of the remake and the older anime.  Anne is a charismatic girl, winning people over with her contagious energy and unshakable earnestness. As such, it is hard to not empathize with her in any of her hardships, and it is what makes following her such a good journey despite the low stakes, slice of life story.  The biggest thing to discuss is its breakneck pace, which is something concerning as it is expected to adapt 3 times the content in half the time. It makes for a more engaging experience as a lot of scenes that were just setting moods and characters hanging out are cut, but it maintains the key moments that push the story and themes forward. However, the speed at which it goes through these events can make for an awkward structuring of the episodes, as well as diminishing the significance of these events. Some go by so fast you wonder if it was even worth keeping them, because the way this story is being told it seems like they barely matter.  So far it has still retained most of the stronger beats of the original story, and it offers an experience quite different from other anime. However, the rapid pace of adaptation makes me worry that the emotional beats might not land as well later in the series, so the older anime seems to remain a compelling alternative. #[Apocalypse Hotel]( ###/u/TehAxelius - Must Watch To a human a century is a lifetime. To the dedicated robots working at the Gingarou Hotel, waiting for the humans to return after the apocalypse, it is merely 36,500 days. The hotel must be ready for the return, the return could happen at any time after all, so as they have been programmed they keep everything in top shape. Any day now.  It is this melancholic foundation that Apocalypse Hotel builds its comedy upon. The acting manager Yachiyo, the last of the human-looking androids, tries her best to keep the hotel running just as it did a century ago. Her dedication persists despite obvious challenges-no stores exist to supply fresh food or toiletries for the rooms, forcing the staff to improvise, adapt and overcome. In this fixation of her purpose as a hotelier while having to adapt to the slowly changing world around her there is something undeniably human, which makes for great comedy as her resolve is put to the test.  With its undying robotic cast the story makes for an interesting perspective of time in this series, years might as well be days as each episode builds on the previous. New cast members at our post-apocalyptic hotel bring with them new challenges for Yachiyo to overcome and adapt to, expanding not only the hotel, but the world around them. As with any anime original it is hard to know where the story will go, but this is one to see where the path leads. ###/u/protractror - Must Watch When one door closes, another one opens. But the great thing about doors is they have these handy knobs that let you open them again even after they close. So if you’re a door opening robot for example, you can just keep on opening that door every time it closes. And if you are a robot who is the acting manager of a hotel, it doesn’t matter what obstacle comes your way. You can always keep on acting like a hotel manager.  Apocalypse Hotel is a show about a skeleton crew of robots keeping on long after the end of the world, as the definitions of “hotel” and “guest” begin to change. The obvious standout is our lead Yachiyo, the hotel’s robotic manager who has kept the hotel running for a century after humanity left the earth. The delicate balance between Yachiyo’s robotic desire to fulfil her purpose and the necessary compromises she must make in her new world is where the show thrives. Maybe guests don’t need to be human anymore, but they still sure as hell have to pay. Even if that just means picking up piles of abandoned cash from across the street. It’s absurd, it’s hilarious, and I have no idea where it will end up. ###/u/SiLeNTxTrYH4Rd - Consider It Many of the greatest sci-fi worlds emerge after a great cataclysm hits. The remaining landscape forges new societies that must adapt, survive, and evolve to exist. What if, instead of moving forward, someone—or something—clung to what they know?   That's the story of Apocalypse Hotel. A squad of robots remains determined to fulfill their master's final order of keeping the hotel running, even if there are no longer any humans to welcome as guests.  With such a great premise and setting there is immense tonal mismatch between the environment and how the show presents itself. The show adopts a formulaic “alien (guest) of the week” structure, where Yachiyo, the hotel’s acting manager, primarily focuses on making extraterrestrial residents feel at home. This leads to absurd comedy that largely misses the mark with me.   Unfortunately, Apocalypse Hotel lacks the narrative depth needed to support its comedic tone. Its success largely depends on whether Yachiyo’s antics resonate with the viewer. Without a clear end goal in mind either, the series feels more like a missed opportunity rather than a must-watch. #[Danjo no Yuujou wa Seiritsu suru? (Iya, Shinai!!)?]( ###u/Hokaze-Junko - Consider It Himari is conflicted—she initially supports her platonic best friend Yuu as he reconnects with his first crush, Enomoto, even setting up a date for them. However, the thought of losing Yuu as just a best friend ignites a possessive jealousy within her. This leads Himari to act in emotionally manipulative ways, desperately trying to get Yuu's attention while simultaneously being unwilling to be the one to openly admit her feelings. This sends confusing and conflicting signals to Yuu, who appears to have some feelings for Himari and is ready to give up everything for her. The show offers a somewhat complex portrayal of Himari's character as she immaturely navigates the complexities of her feelings and her long-standing friendship with Yuu as a high school student. However, viewers who empathize with Yuu might find themselves frustrated by Himari's behavior. Nevertheless, the over-the-top situations that stem from Himari’s actions can make it an entertaining watch. #[Food for the Soul]( ###/u/isrozzis - Watch It Food for the Soul is a delightful SoL focusing on a group of girls in the food research club at university. The story and character designs are original works of Atto, the Non Non Biyori original creator, and are the highlights of the show. Atto excels at creating deeply authentic characters that feel like people that you would meet in your day to day life. Sure, some of their quirks are turned up a bit to fit into slice of life comedies, but at their core they are very real and that’s where much of the charm comes from. Food for the Soul is no exception and the cast truly feels like a group of college students hanging out in their new club.   Should you watch it? In my opinion, yes! Especially if you are a fan of slice of life shows. This is an excellent take on the genre and the cast and somewhat unique setting of university comfortably elevate this above much of the competition. ###/u/master_of_ares - Watch It Food for the Soul is already a fun and promising watch by virtue of its strong cast and lighthearted comedy being immediately reminiscent of its senpai Non Non Biyori and Tanaka-kun.  In HibiMeshi, Kawatsura and Atto again demonstrate unique skill in making the cast quickly feel authentic and relatable. Grounding the humor in that helps makes the character interactions, comedic or not, feel natural, earned, and endearing. Early setups, smart twists, and impeccable comedic timing in the voice direction and editing all come across as a welcome breath of fresh air in a landscape of jokes being simply shouting, making a face, or explaining a previous joke.  While the first few episodes have lightly touched on deeper thematic elements, I so far expect HibiMeshi will primarily remain a school club slice-of-life series. That said, I would be delighted if occasional episodes delve into deeper character storytelling as well. All in all, if Food for the Soul maintains even just its absolute baseline competence as a school club slice of life, it will already stand out to me as one of the most worthwhile shows this year. #[GUILTY GEAR STRIVE: DUAL RULERS]( ###/u/Schinco - Consider It Guilty Gear is a bizarre franchise, and the uneven and unique adaptation befits this. While I’m vaguely aware of the franchise, it’s clearly designed for fans – there’s copious fanservice, a blazing fast pacing that often doesn’t bother to do silly things like giving context or fully introducing characters. Still, if you’re familiar with the series or willing to roll with the punches, it has a certain charm to it all.  Another hallmark of the series is its camp – befitting of a series where you can pit a hulking secret agent who wields an alien cask from Area 51 against a dubiously licensed “physician” masked by a paper bag, the series throws its eclectic cast of characters together in a somewhat haphazard and often jarring manner but simultaneously demands you take it just as seriously as the story does. This can be hit or miss and even depend on your headspace or group while watching.  The animation certainly isn’t going to blow you away, and the production as a whole seems content to overuse slow pans and sweeps in lieu of sakuga. That being said, the intricate designs are ported over with surprising fidelity, there are some really neat visual hallmarks such as the frequent use of a stained-glass aesthetic, and the show still oozes the characteristic over-the-top style of the parent series.  ###/u/Animestuck - Drop It Guilty Gear fans will likely appreciate this anime for its familiar characters and writing, but it offers little to newcomers. While it does attempt to accommodate unfamiliar viewers with extensive exposition, its sheer volume and rapid pace of character introductions and game lore feel top-heavy and frontloaded, resulting in a somewhat overwhelming and unsatisfying experience.   All that said, the action is what really matters here, but even that leaves a lot to be desired. The action is surprisingly choppy, not just exhibiting the usual robotic animation 3D sometimes struggles with, but furthermore replacing a lot of movement with stills, quick cuts, or other tricks to avoid actually going through with the animation. The action just isn’t satisfying to watch, and for a franchise with access to so many unique character designs, it’s disappointing the lack of variety in the actual attacks and techniques on display. #[Kowloon Generic Romance]( ###/u/TehAxelius - Watch It Being a fan of the manga, Kowloon feels especially hard to praise. Talking about any specific strength of its characters, mysteries and themes of nostalgia and identity, feels like it will invariably spoil *something* for a prospective viewer. Add to that a rapid pace of adapting the material, a production that strains to capture the magic of the pages and a statement from the production that the 12 episodes will be a “complete adaptation” of a manga that is still ongoing and you have manga readers already decrying it as the worst adaptation of a manga since *Medalist*.  However, despite that worry, you should still give it a shot. Kowloon and the characters that make up the core of the mystery are brought lovingly to life in this show as it explores their different sides and how they all connect together in the mystery. It is a show that breathes in nostalgia, from how Kowloon itself is an anachronistic place of 90s technology mixed with modern conveniences, to how the animation itself feels both modern and retro at the same time. While we have no idea how this adaptation will come together in the end, so far it has shown that it is able to create one of the most atmospheric shows of the season. ###/u/protractror - Watch It Something weird is going on in the walled city of Kowloon. Maybe it has to do with the big ominous computer floating in the sky, but let’s not get hung up on that. This is a love story about identity. Are you still you with no context? What would you say? And what would your partner?  The mystery in Kowloon can be frustrating. It’s not apparent yet what’s going on, but by episode one it’s clear which thread they should be exploring. However our lead Kujirai is seemingly in no rush to do so. To be fair, this mystery could easily flip her life upside down, so the slow drip of information she uncovers makes sense. And the hot, leaky world of Kowloon is interesting enough that the slow burn is a minor issue.  The visuals for the show are anything but generic. The walled city is a wonderful backdrop, combined with character designs that look a few decades out of place help create a nostalgia for something you likely didn’t experience. If you’re tired of the typical high school romances, this show is definitely worth checking out. ###/u/DoctorWhoops - Must Watch Kowloon Generic Romance is not what its title suggests it to be. Kowloon is the setting of our “Generic Romance”, a walled city where protagonist Kuirai Reiko works her day job, falls in love with a coworker, and one where she... *discovers that her memories are failing her and that she is not quite who she thinks she is*. The city is dreary and decaying yet strangely nostalgic, and is… *constantly under the surveillance of a floating sci-fi computer that they call Genetic Terra*. It’s where our characters eat, sleep, work, and …*use surgery to completely change their appearance from head to toe*. And yet, to a Kowloon resident, nothing is unusual about this.  These strange circumstances create one of the most fascinating setups of any anime in recent memory; viewing it head on it’s an atmospheric, intimate and well-written story about unrequited feelings and identity. That alone would be a great show, but the occasional peeks behind the curtain reveal more and more unsettlingly strange secrets and sci-fi elements that make you question deeply to what extent any of it is real. #[Lazarus]( ###/u/hjanikian - Watch It In the year 2052 everyone discovers that the drug Hapna, which has brought world peace and cured all pain, actually is a ticking time bomb that will kill all users three years after they took it. We follow an assembled crew of misfits that have no shortage of personality as they look for the creator of Hapna, Dr. Skinner, in order to secure a vaccine.   The combination of Floating Points, Kamasi Washington, and Bonobo on the soundtrack helps complement the fast-paced action with infectious jazz and EDM. While there are some issues with the sound design in a couple episodes that take away from the oomph of the punches and kicks landing, the animation sequences have been extremely engaging in part thanks to Chad Stahelski (director of the John Wick series) assisting as action supervisor.   Five episodes in and I have felt that the Shinichirou Watanabe production has kept me on my toes. With the visual and audio side of things being better than your average seasonal, this series is definitely worth checking out to see how thrilling you find its narrative as the Lazarus group inches ever closer to Skinner, unraveling his past with encounters around the globe. ###/u/Taiboss - Consider It There is a scene in episode 5 of Lazarus, where our MC fights in an elevator. The choreography is actually pretty good, but the actual animation makes the fight look so extremely goofy that the scene ends up unintentionally funny instead of cool.  Being unintentionally funny really is Lazarus’s main selling point and why you should at least consider it. You have to approach it from that angle, because if you want it to be a serious, cool, groovy show like Shinichirou Watanabe’s best then you’re going to get burnt as soon as you watch episode 1 waste what feels like half its runtime on parkour.  There’s a lot in Lazarus that feels half-baked. From the characters to the world and the pacing, everything feels like the core of a great show is there, it just needed someone to properly rewrite the... eh... entire script. But if you approach it as a “So bad it’s good” show, the good parts will stand out more and let you have a much better time. If that’s not an option for you, skip it.  But honestly – why does the opening have to sound like the band just winged the entire song? “Tank” is *iconic!* Why isn’t this OP?! #[Maebashi Witches]( ###/u/Animestuck - Watch It A regional idol show with a twist, *Maebashi Witches* hits a bit of a rocky start. The show takes a risk with Azu, who starts out pretty unlikeable through their conflict with Yuina. However, it pretty easily pivots that into a rather well earned upswing that rounds the development of the cast and its relationships, setting the stage for the show to come. The show is somewhat self-aware in a tongue-in-cheek way, making observations more than commentary with this aspect, but still keeping things light and fun while hitting dramatic beats. There is some awkwardness in how the characters behave, a mix of maturity and immaturity that leaves a slight artificial feel in the melodrama, but there’s also a magic to it that makes the characters endearing in how they come to know one another, especially Yuina. The show isn’t moving particularly fast so far, which might come back to bite it as it reaches the end of its 12 episode run if it actually tries to have a conclusion. There is a rising action and momentum in how the show is developing, though, that makes me think it might wind up being a hidden gem of the season. ###/u/collapsedblock6 - Watch It  Maebashi Witches is about a group of 5 girls gathered by a magical mascot with the mission of granting wishes to people in need. A normal sounding mahou shoujo anime, so what’s the catch?  For starters, this group is rather dysfunctional, far from the classic groups powered by friendship. It makes for some fun clashes of personalities, and rocky situations become more chaotic to solve which add to the entertainment. Azu’s harsh personality and how it clashes with everyone else is a particular highlight, adding smug and snarky remarks that often catch you off guard.  The structure of the story has a new person coming to their store with a conflict to resolve each week. So far the show has done fine connecting their issues to some underlying conflict someone in the main cast already has. It can get a tad melodramatic, and not everyone in the cast has been likeable enough to fully empathize with their developments.  Maebashi Witches is a show where one can try one episode and know if it is for them, as it does well capturing the several tones and humor it handles, but it is not for everyone.  #[Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuux]( ###/u/Taiboss - Consider It Abandon hope, all ye who entered into Gundam through Witch From Mercury and think G-Quacks will be like it.  Gundam GQuuuuuuX takes place in an alternative timeline, split off from the beginning of the original Universal Century from the 1979 OG series and its sequels. As a result, it is chock-full of characters, sounds, shots, themes and worldbuilding from these works, leading to so goddamn many Leonardo pointing memes… But while I as a OG watcher love this, if you’re a newcomer, you might be confused by, uh, everything. The show so far hasn’t been very good at exposition for the parts a newcomer might need, leading you to often understand the what, but not quite the why.  Additionally, a focus on mech battles away from character leads to the cast feeling a bit shallow and hard to get to know so far. While our protagonist Machu is very likeable, she has her annoying parts; her wingman Shuji’s personality seems to be “stoner who hears voices” and third wheel Nyaan needed until the latest episode to even justify her existence.  GQuuuuuuX is a very fun, well-produced show, but you should know what you’re getting into. Accessible it ain’t. ###/u/WaterDarkE - Watch It Amate Yuzuriha, an originary high school student, lives a peaceful life in Side 6, a neutral space colony. However, after meeting Nyaan, a war refugee, her life drastically changes as she encounters the GQuuuuuuX, a top secret mech and starts to fight in Clan Battles where death is commonplace to win money.  Overall, watching this series is a treat for the eyes. As a joint production between Sunrise and Studio Khara, it feels especially fresh and crisp while referencing the UC timeline. From the extensive and skilled 3D CG use for the mechs and backgrounds to clean 2D animation for the rest, you can tell that they are putting their all in the one cour runtime they have. You also get a full fight in almost all the episodes, get a sense of intrigue regarding what’s going on behind the scenes, and wonder how exactly things will play out. Will it end with a happy ending or a sad ending? It's hard to say at this point, but I am interested in seeing how it will all end. ###/u/drjwilson - Drop It After ""Witch From Mercury"", I was super excited for Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX. After all, Hideaki Anno himself was part of the writing team! I eagerly consumed the first episode. I found it serviceable; it set up the world, introduced us to interesting characters, and was flashy when it needed to be. However, with each episode, I began to realize that GQuuuuuuX may not have quite been made for me. Episode 2 was a bit of a confusing mess that I found hard to follow. It apparently was a nod to the original series, changing critical events and revelling in the branching paths. Chock-full of classic references—from iconic cuts, OST, down to the *mid-cards*—it made clear that GQuuuuuuX is a love letter to classic Gundam and a godsend to those fans.  Unfortunately, I'm not one of them.   From a production standpoint, there are some incredible highs, as one might expect from a team headed by Kazuya Tsurumaki. But there also exist some confounding (cough CG cough) lows. Production aside, I can't ever shake the feeling that I'm missing something while watching, like character motivations or important story elements. Several times, I found my eyes glazing over. I'm sure this show is a ""must watch"" for some. But unless you're an OG Gundam fan or willing to give some things a binge, I would pass on GQuuuuuuX. #[mono]( ###/u/drjwilson - Must Watch As someone who, 1. Loves Yuru Camp, 2. Recently got a DSLR, and 3. Has an upcoming trip to Japan, mono had all of the pieces necessary to delight, and delight me it did. Satsuki Amamiya finds herself as the sole member of the Photography Club, but becomes determined to keep it going. She scrounges together enough friends and sets off into the world to experiment with photography.  But Satsuki isn't the only one experimenting. mono's presentation has been incredibly inventive and creative. Whether that be interesting framing, ""camera"" tricks, or ""blink and you miss it"" moments of animation—mono is a feast for the eyes. It truly is able to show the power of adaptation, somehow outperforming imagination.   Storywise, the foundation raises interesting questions, like ""How does one cope with change,"" and ""What keeps us in our hobbies?"" We've yet to see if these questions will be fully explored, the show instead opting for a sort of ""quest giver"" structure. But really, it's an excuse for our characters to go out into the world, capture what interests them, and bring it back for us to see. With playful character dynamics, gorgeous eye candy, and moments of introspection; mono is the whole package. ###/u/DarkFuzz - Consider It It’s almost as if the gods of CGDCT themselves came down and fused all the popular and classic moe shows into one package.  Written by the same author who wrote *Yuru Camp*, *mono* feels like its successor, capturing the same feel-good vibes and reverence for nature alongside the wacky antics of cute girls trying to figure out their new hobby.  Hiroyuki Kobayashi has his hands all over this project, especially with stylistic callbacks to old moe classics like *Hidamari Sketch* and *K-ON!*, but with a nice modern coat of paint.  I spent a good few minutes fixated on the hair animation being so vibrant and expressive.  It’s…comforting, and that’s all you need from a show like this.  Though references to real life photography/camera concepts are minimal and fairly basic, it instead focuses on each individual’s relationship with the lens itself.  Whether it’s appreciating nature or taking pictures of your senpai, understanding *why* you are taking these pictures is just as important as *how* you take them.  While I don’t see this show surpassing its predecessors yet, if you are missing a comfy anime in your lineup this season, consider picking this up to balance your load. ###/u/ValkyrieCain9 - Consider It On paper this seemed perfectly made for me: cute girls doing cute things where the cute thing they are doing is photography, and from the same mangaka as Yuru Camp, all things I love! And yet—I find myself not loving mono. In the world of CGDCT, the central activity, be it camping, fishing, or even DIY, connects you to the characters and can even inspire you. In the case of mono, for an anime that was sold as a photography anime, very little photography has taken place so far. Instead we have followed the characters as they’ve snacked, filmed, live-streamed, and gathered inspiration for a manga. All fun things to watch, but a little disappointing when I was most looking forward to connecting with the characters as they fell in love with the art of photography. There was a hint of that with Amamiya’s senpai, but she quickly leaves and with her so do my hopes for a more photography-focused narrative. As the story is now, I am more interested in seeing how Akiyama continues to find inspiration for her manga, than following the antics and the rest of the characters.  #[Ninja to Koroshiya no Futarigurashi]( ###/u/isrozzis - Must Watch Shaft’s latest anime is about the unlikely cohabitation of Satoko, a naive ninja who can make anything vanish into a pile of leaves, and Konoha, a cynical assassin who gaslights her way through life. Konoha is the prime example of gaslight gatekeep girlboss and having someone so shamelessly awful be one of our leads brings such a unique energy.   While the show is a comedy at heart, many of the punchlines come with a darker twist and often involve someone being murdered right in front of us.  The production of the show is a delight too. It is not heavy on sakuga or breathtaking animation and instead has chosen to use art style and different mediums in very Shaft ways to highlight scenes or set a particular tone.  Should you watch it? In my opinion, absolutely. Comedy is subjective, but this is one of the best dark comedies we’ve had in a long time and if that appeals to you at all you will enjoy it.   [You can also check out an alternative version of this writeup in video form!]( ###/u/master_of_ares - Must Watch Two big surprises. First, a proper Shaft comedy for the first time in, what, 10 years? Second, it's pretty good! Loser girl ninja and cool girl assassin is a pretty decent pitch to me on its own, but the production already sets it a step above, and the subversive deadpan humor does so again.  Miyamoto’s first solo direction has been naturally evoking both classic ““Shaft-isms”” and new creative tricks that together feel comfortable side by side. In its variety, Kazuya Shiotsuki's character designs have proven endlessly appealing and flexible, while VA work by KanaHana and relative newbie Mikawa remain the heart of the show. That is, as much as Ninkoro has a heart; to its comedic end it's impressive how little is sacred. Side characters are introduced and mercilessly swept away, typically precious anime feelings are stepped on for money, and No Hugging No Learning seems to apply to ninjas and assassins as well.  In a crowded seasonal landscape, Ninkoro stands confidently apart with its sharp humor and distinctive visual creativity. In part a return to form for Shaft, it is a testament to how effective their particular brand of entertainment can be when executed with this level of care and creativity. ###/u/voidembracedwitch - Drop It A Shaft production led by Yukihiro Miyamoto, director of Madoka Magica, and it's a dark comedy with lesbian overtones? On paper this combination of traits should've been an easy slam dunk, yet it ended up a miss for me.  Credit where it's due, eccentric shifts in art style for comedy and no shortage of interesting shot compositions, often utilizing lighting to create high-contrast environments, allow NinKoro to construct striking scenes on the regular.  The comedic formula and dynamic of the leading duo meanwhile don't live up to expectations. Playing up the dichotomy between the leads being cute girls and their nonchalant disposal of the many assassins sent after them quickly loses its edge when it happens 1-2 times an episode. Additionally, assassin Konoha's cold, dismissive attitude towards her ditzy ninja accomplice Sakoto constantly runs the risk of coming off as straightforwardly mean-spirited since it doesn't lean into cruelty enough to loop around to being humorous.  While the most recent episodes have shown some promise with endearing additions to the cast beyond the main duo alongside further broadening the range of visual flourishes employed, they didn't move the needle much. The decision to drop NinKoro still was an easy one to make. #[Shiunji-ke no Kodomotachi]( ###/u/SiLeNTxTrYH4Rd - Consider It From the mind behind Rent-a-Girlfriend, The Shiunji Family Children follows the lives of the seven Shiunji siblings, as they discover that they are not all related by blood. The series attempts to navigate the blurred lines between familial bonds, budding romantic feelings, and the confusion that ensues to various degrees of success.  Unlike his previous work, Reiji Miyajima has created a main character who is not an oblivious trainwreck of a human. Instead, Arata Shiunji is a caring brother who actively wants the best for his family, and puts in the effort to show that. Unfortunately each sister falls into more generic tropes, but the scenarios that each girl is put through are hilarious and deepen their relationship in more meaningful ways due to their unique circumstance of having history together as family.  Many people will find the premise disturbing or inappropriate and drop it immediately. However, for those who can look past that will find not the peak of the harem genre, but one that leans into uncomfortable themes with sincerity—offering a strangely compelling mix of awkward comedy, emotional vulnerability, and social taboo. ###/u/Animestuck - Drop It Light fun to round out your seasonal watches if you’re feeling starved for harem RomComs, but despite its premise distinguishing it, the final product is rather boilerplate. The pre-existing relationship between Arata and the primary love interests as siblings acts as a built-in excuse for why Arata knows, lives with, and interacts with them, and serves as a more reasonable conflict and justification for why these characters can’t simply acknowledge their attraction to one another. However, without much actual exploration of this idea and development, it winds up being just another stalling tactic, used in all the most infuriating ways RomComs love to delay things. The show also fails to use their pasts together to speedrun cast introduction, expositing things the characters should already know about one another frequently.   Outside of that, it’s your usual harem RomCom structure: a series of comedic scenarios, featuring different flavors of girls, intended to put characters in situations filled with sexual tension and/or develop their relationship in the direction of the characters considering romance with one another. Nothing wrong with this formula, but the scenarios aren’t especially creative here, so there’s probably better things to watch that deliver everything this does and more. #[Rock wa Lady no Tashinami Deshite]( ###/u/Taiboss - Watch It Which show are we talking about? The show in which the members of a girl music group come of age by playing their hearts out while being ambiguously gay? Do you have the slightest idea how little that narrows it down?  So, if you have watched prior girl band shows, Rock is a Lady’s Modesty will not surprise you. The utilisation of music for the characters to understand and express their emotions, the yuri undertones, and the Ojou-sama setting are all solidly done, but feel familiar. On the other hand, the show does have its unique elements in the strong usage of cover songs and the band being completely instrumental, which gives you a glimpse into a genre overlooked even in anime. That, and its clever character concepts, give it a clear identity of its own.  All in all, Rock is a Lady’s Modesty is a must-watch for people who loved prior girl band shows, and a should-watch for those that haven’t watched many. It’s a serious, sincere story about girls trying to be their true self in the facade-filled world that is elite Japanese private education. Also, the music slaps – obviously. They teamed up with Band-Maid, after all. ###/u/Nick_BOI - Watch It Rock wa Lady is a show that focuses almost entirely on the sheer cathartic release of forgetting your worries and truly letting loose through rock music. A lot of time is taken to set the stage here, showing off how absolutely *suffocating* Lilisa's life is, as she is torn between what her family expects of her and her desire to just forget it all and play the guitar like she loves to do. You have the outward identity of the refined lady, contrasted with the secret of a hardcore rocker when the mask comes off.  The performances themselves are also framed as a battle for dominance, with everyone involved giving it their all for the sole purpose of pushing themselves and their bandmates. Even if we only know about Lilisa's personal life, you can really tell the others share similar feelings from the performances alone. The end result is some of the most cathartic and intense performances you will find in any music anime. The setup is simple and obvious, yet incredibly effective. #[Uma Musume: Cinderella Gray]( ###/u/Danhoc - Must Watch It Cinderella Gray tells a ""rise to the top"" story of Oguri Cap, the adorable and persistent horse girl who just wants to have fun at racing and yet to find her life goals. Alongside her are coach Kitahara Jones, who until now only dared to dream of winning a top regional race, and teammate Benlo Light, who struggles to achieve any results in racing.  Strictly based on real horse racing history, Cinderella Gray approaches the sport seriously, preserving tension and drama on the track and giving a proper attention to details and explanations. But between races and drama it doesn't shy away from being more lighthearted and funny, bringing a refreshing change of tone. The beauty of Cinderella Gray's narrative lies in its simplicity; once you can accept the oddball world of Uma Musume, characters take the spotlight. The show explores themes of rivalry, search for life goals and directions, selfishness and the role of the coach as a mentor, allowing for growth in the characters as they reflect on these issues. The staff's care for the show not only translates into good direction but solid production backbone as well, delivering spectacular racing action and charming character acting.   If the peculiar world of anthropomorphic horse girls doesn't scare you and you're looking for a sports anime with a focus on characters and good production qualities, Cinderella Gray is the anime you want to give a watch. ###/u/TehAxelius - Watch It I’ll be honest, I’ve always been sceptical to the Uma Musume franchise with its gacha idol horse girls, but I’ve also seen enough sports anime to know that they can turn any competition into an experience as hype as a Battle Shounen. Cinderella Gray wastes no time getting to this point. After a crash-course in its world of anthropomorphised race horses we’re introduced to our loveable oddball of a protagonist, Oguri Cap. A colourful supporting cast of friends and rivals make for great drama, as their clashing perspectives force Oguri to consider what it is she’s actually running for.  The races themselves make for perfect sports-anime fodder, giving us at least one visit to the track each episode. The explosive and fast paced nature of these short distance races means that the matches are neither truncated, skipping through to get to the highlights, or drawn out over multiple episodes. From the time the gates open it is instant and constant action until the first horsegirl crosses the finish line. Here Cygames really shows their chops. Evocative storyboarding and powerful running animations, set to a beat of thundering hooves and a hype soundtrack makes each race and competition exciting.",anime,1kktrbz
"Looking for a anime from the early 2000 or possibly late 90s could have been a movie. So I was born in 1993 and moved citys when I was 10 so It was released before 2003 or that year.

"Anime where girl only knew how to make Tamagoyaki for lunch As the title says, I can't remember which anime it was.

However, the only thing she knew how to make was Tamagoyaki (Omelettes in the dub) and so all the lunch boxes would be filled with them.

"Need help finding this old anime I used to watch with my dad Hi, I’m looking for an anime I watched with my dad when I was about 6 years old, around 13 years ago (so 2010s or late 2000s). I don’t remember the title or much else, but I remember it had monsters that characters could control.  There’s one episode I remember clearly: a red and blue monster escapes from it's prison in a forest and causes chaos. At the end of the episode, the main character fights the main villain. I don’t remember what happened after that.  This anime means a lot to me because I used to watch it with my dad before he passed away. If anyone knows what this might be, please let me know.  Thanks.   Edit: I dunno why I just remembered this now, and why I've been frantically looking for this anime all day. I guess it made me think about how little I remember about my life and my dad before i became 7(that's when I got consciousness I guess).

"Terrible adaptations of good novels? I'm looking for some anime that were terrible adaptations of good novels because I want to read more of the source novels. Problem is, there's quite a few novels that are boring and I drop or slog through.  I've noticed that watching a badly adapted show makes me want to read the novels out of more or less pure spite, especially due to how huge the contrast is between the two. Granted most anime based on novels are always going to be some degree of rushed if you're trying to fit several books into a cour, but some do it better than others.  An example of what I'm looking for is **No. 6**. The first time I watched it, I thought the anime was pretty good up until the last few episodes where they shat the bed. Come to read the novels and I find out no, the ending wasn't bad; rather, the entire anime was - at least compared to the novels, and not least because they only adapted half the series in half the time that was required to do even that part justice. It's still very enjoyable but I gained an appreciation of both the novels and the anime after watching, reading and rewatching the show lol.  And the reason I don't want any good adaptations is because then I won't really feel like reading the source material lol. Something that's just mediocre enough but not terrible - like around a 7-7.5 on MAL - but not because the source material itself is bad.  Which ones do you recommend?",anime,1kls3xe

"My Thoughts on Dandadan I wrote this review for MyAnimeList when the series was airing and I had only seen like 3 or 4 episodes, but I still agree with everything I said here.      Dandadan is easily one of the best anime of the year. It’s surprising because most big seasonal anime like this rarely live up to the hype. That’s not to say that the most hyped up anime are usually bad because I don’t believe that either, but I almost always feel let down by them. Hype truly is an evil beast that can prevent me from loving an anime the way I would like to. But somehow, Dandadan survived that struggle.Through a combination of passionate staff that care about the source material and are super talented, and adapting a truly badass source material, Dandadan rose above the crowd and delivered an anime that has the potential to be a masterpiece.      The premise sounds like clickbait of a really bad YouTube video. I say that, but then again it got me interested in it. An evil witch steals the balls of the MC, Ken Takakura, also known as Okarun, which are massive golden spheres for some reason, not long after he makes friends with a girl named Momo Ayase. Okarun adamantly believes in ghosts and Momo firmly believes in aliens, and this differences causes them to form a close friendship, and eventually romantic feelings.      And that’s all there is to it; after that, it’s one of the most genuinely fun rides I’ve seen in anime in awhile. Like seriously, the entertainment is nonstop. Both of the two main characters are instantly likeable and brimming with vibrant personality. I love the contrast between Okarun and Momo. On the surface it looks like they would have no similarities at all, but this series does the My Dress-Up Darling thing of having that be a facade. In reality they’re very similar, they both believe in something that lots of other people would call crazy, namely aliens and ghosts respectively, and they’re super passionate about it. However, they also have enough differences that genuine, heartfelt, hilarious conflict can also spark between them.      That’s where most of the humor comes from. It’s either them arguing about the thing they believe in being real while the other being ridiculous, or Okarun involuntarily going into his demonic form and Momo having to quickly revert him back, or Momo teasing Okarun about loosing his balls and Okaurn verbally pummeling her for it. And that’s another thing, Okarun may be timid, but he’s not a doormat. He proves early on that he’s easily able to match Momo’s tendency for smart ass remarks and defend himself.      There’s no doubt that their relationship is the heart of the story. From the funny moments to the to the drama. While Momo and Okarun does have a lot of funny banter, they also have more heartfelt, thoughtful moments as well, such as early in the series when Momo chastising Okarun for being too timid, and for constantly apologizing and putting himself beneath others, claiming that this is why he has no friends. It’s these diverse, complex traits that not only make them fun characters on their own, but makes their friendship so damn endearing. And makes me want them to become a couple as well, although like in most cases I haven’t read the manga so I don’t know if it’s happened yet or not, or if that’s even the trajectory, it is kind of hard to tell from just what the anime has given us so far.      Momo is a fascinating character, and there is one more, arguably more complex reason why. In recent years there’s been a trend in trying to improve the female characters in anime and manga, and I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. Some of the most famous ones recently have been Marin Kitagawa in My Dress-Up Darling, Maomao in The Apothecary Diaries, Frieren in Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, and almost all of the women in Jujutsu Kaisen. Not to say that there’s never been strong ladies in anime before this, I mean Rumiko Takahashi was well known for this going all the way back to Urusei Yatsura in the 1970s, and while I don’t think most of her works hold up, I still respect her for her importance to the manga industry.      But besides her, there’s been anime like Black Lagoon, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood have casts littered with amazing women, so anime fans haven’t exactly been starved for female characters, but I will acknowledge that it has been more common in the past few years. And I feel like Momo Ayase from Dandadan fits into this category as well. She has the standard stuff Otaku expect from an anime waifu--she’s very attractive, funny, and interesting--but she’s also incredibly useful and is able to match the male MC in his role in the story and his wild personality and antics.      She doesn’t require the male MC to be a strong character, but she is stronger with him, and he is stronger with her. I do hope they become a couple, but even if they don’t and their relationship remains purely platonic there’s a level of strength and catharsis with their friendship, but again Momo’s character doesn’t require that friendship to be strong. And neither does Okarun’s, for that matter. I’ve been thinking about making a video talking about some of my favorite women in anime, and I’ll have to at least consider discussing Momo if I do, because she’s actually great.      Oh, there’s other characters in this anime too, right? Yeah, I guess I got so caught up in talking about Momo and Okarun, especially Momo, and I haven’t gotten to talk about them yet. Well, the other characters are good as well, but we don’t get enough of them for me to call them truly great. The only one that comes close is Seiko Ayase, Momo’s grandmother, who has had quite a bit of screen time and I do like her a lot. She’s funny whenever she’s on screen, and her relationship with Momo is fascinating but so far we haven’t gotten that much of it. But in and of herself I do enjoy her because he’s entertaining, and for…other reasons.      All of the characters are good in their own way. I’d say only Momo and Okarun are great so far, but every single one of them that we spend a significant amount of time with have merit. I say a significant amount of time because there’s characters like Momo’s Gyaru friends that we get like one or two very brief scenes with so it’s difficult to form any kind of opinion on them either positive or negative.      But the most amazing thing about this anime is that there’s almost no downtime when nothing is happening and I’m bored. Even in many of my all time favorite anime, that’s almost never the case, it’s actually exceptional. But despie saying that, I still can’t say that Dandadan is an all time favorite anime, namely because I’m only 8 episodes in at the time of this writing, and haven’t read the manga. So it’s not an all time favorite anime “yet” would be a better way to put it. But I do think it contains all the ingredients to reach those extraordinary heights for me. A wonderful cast of characters with depth and intrigue but are still fun and entertaining, with fascinating and enjoyable relationships with each other and interactions, and…let’s say above average quality of comedy, a genre that can be very hit or miss for me in anime.      There’s one more thing I wanna talk about though, and that’s the visuals. Now I’m no animation expert, but the animation in Dandadan seems very experimental and unique. I don’t really have the words to describe inventive animation in an analytical way so You'll probably just have to try it yourself to see what I'm talking about, but I'll try my best. The inventive animation, art, and color design mostly shows up during the action sequences, where the staff really went out of their way to make us salivate at what we were looking at.

"Joshiraku Rewatch Overall Discussion # Joshiraku Rewatch Overall Discussion *** [Previous episode]( | [Index]( *** The curtain falls, so does our performance ends. *** ## Links, useful info:  [MAL](  [Anilist](  [Anidb](  [Kitsu](  [Livechart](  [ANN](  *** ## Streams:  Unfortunately there are not much, and only in a few countries.  [Amazon Prime](  [Hidive](  [Roku](  That is all I could find.  Otherwise...[](#piracy)  *** ## Currently disclosed information:  1) Ebizou  This name was mentioned multiple times during the series. From the scarce information we knew, that name belongs to a kabuki actor, who is an acquintance or a friend to the rakugo girls.  That name is an obvious reference to the Ichikawa family line of kabuki actors. It is closely related to the names Ichikawa Danjuro, Ichikawa Shinnosuke and Matsumoto Koshiro.  Ebizo/Danjuro/Shinnosuke/Koshiro are not real names, these are stages names which bestowed by traditional naming ceremonies held in kabuki theatres called shumei (name succession). This name holds huge importance, as if somebody receives that name, it is considered a great honor.  Most of the Ichikawa family are blood-related, some of them were joined via adoption. This family pioneered the aragoto style of acting.  The current name holder is Ichikawa Danjuro XIII (formerly known as Ichikawa Ebizo XI, birth name Takatoshi Horikoshi).  *** ## Questions for the day:  1) Best character?  2) Best episode? Best segment?  3) What could have been better?  4) How did you enjoyed that?  5) How would you rate this? On a 1-10 spectrum  6) Did the series inspired you for a trip in Tokyo?  7) Do you think this series could work in 2025?  *** ## Highlights from yesterday:  1) Marii can be resonsible for having a bad timing, by u/LeminaAusa:  > Somehow not surprised that Marii herself is the worst offender.  and u/PGleo86:  > Audience really said ""get off the stage"" to Marii... maybe she deserved it for ruining Kigu's concert experience.  > ...and Gankyou's baseball experience.  > ...and everyone else's affairs, apparently.  2) u/Silcaria wondering about how can a fictional character get a proper IRL funeral:  > I'd like to know how one goes about attending the funeral of a fictionnal character.  You're not the only one being curious about it.  3) And of course the Hunter building will always be incomplete (just like the Sagrada Familia), from u/y2k890:  > I laughed at how Kukuru wanted a Hunter building as that was clearly a reference to the hiatuses that Hunter X Hunter gets. It's especially funny because those still continue to this day.  Blame Togashi for that.  4) And you final daily dose of u/Cretviones:  > Man, that was a solid ova, hilarious as fuck and I think one of my more favourite episodes from the series, though I kinda wish we watched it before the last episode, so the last episode could have had a more lingering impact. But Alas, you can just say that this shit is merely bad timing, eh? Marii-chan should sing ain't got no rhythm if she wants to practice some rhythm, although getting hypnotized also works. Second segment featured our final drip contest... Hail Tetora-chan our final winner! That mature woman look was just so elegant I love her, though glassless Gan-chan was cute af. Overall in the entire series, Kukuru-chan was the winner, she was just the most consistent in her fashion choices, and was very often my second, even if I never disclosed it. And god this was my favourite travel segment, visiting all the manga companies and shit, AND NOTHING WAS CENSORED. They really made that HiatusxHiatus joke, and One Piece is the money minter as always. Even stuff from 2012 remains the same, nothing ever changes. Thank you to the hard working mangaka who started the spark that made this anime possible, and thank you to all in the industry who work terribly for our entertainment! Shogakukan, Shueisha, and Kodansha were all features, rip Champion though ig, wasn't that popular in 2013, not a part of the big 4 conversation. Final segment, god I was so focused on what it was going to be, and it ended up being peak focused. God I love all the meta stuff. Kigu-chan with the focus lines was hilarious, and so was the bubbly Marii-chan, but god these girls really get along with each other, despite their bullying , which I love dearly! These girls are their own focus group, I love it, and that nothing way of ending the ova was peak. Also loved the sihllouttes. Joshiraku, you are an anime that I most probably won't rewatch, yet thanks for the smiles these past two weeks. Marii-chan best girl I love you. The show's a 7/10, 9/10 OVA.  5) u/xbolt90 confirms that companies are indeed colorful like deliquents:  > ""Greater Japan Oratorical Society Kodansha"" has lots of complicated kanji. But as we learned in episode 7, delinquents like complicated characters. Hmm... Perhaps the origins of book publishers are more colorful than we've been led to believe.  The final best daily comment awards goes to u/LeminaAusa, u/deadunistudent, u/y2k890 and u/PGleo86  The final results of daily comment honors:  User | Received awards :--:|:--: u/LeminaAusa | 14 u/deadunistudent | 13 u/PGleo86 | 6 u/y2k890 | 6 u/Specs64z | 2 u/Tresnore | 1  *** [Thank you for your continued appreciation!]( [Until we meet again]( [](#toradorasalute)",anime,1kl2hdw

I would also like if the anime had some educational vibes too but not necessary.   Other anime I've loved that are some what similar are:   Moriarty the Patriot (loved the subversion of the classic novel series).

[DOKONJOFINGER](  The four delinquent Kings of Dokonjo high school who rule the school's fight club hierarchy and hate each others' guts, but have been forced into begrudingly playing together by threat of expulsion. Guts, guts, guts - they're all obsessed with showing off who has the most guts, which tends to just lead to them brawling... even if it's in the middle of a concert. Even their name is a play on ""guts"" (根性 / konjō).  Their musical style is Japanese-style punk-rock with a lot of group chant-like backup vocals. Yasu (Kento Itō) is their main singer though Hachin (Shōhei Komatsu) does a fair bit of lead singing, too. Joe (Yūki Ono) and Sojun (Yūsuke Shirai) mainly just do backup vocals, though they each have a solo song, too.   DOKONJOFINGER was introduced in 2020 at the start of Fes a Live (the second mobile game) similar to Mashumairesh!!, and they are quite prominent in the franchise but they weren't setup with the intent of them being an equal flagship role alongside Mashumairesh!! or anything like that. And no big project of getting rookie performers and having them learn their instruments for real or anything like that either - DOKONJOFINGER's performers were already established VAs who'd previously performed in Idolmaster Side M, Hypnosis Mic, I★Chu, IDOLISH7, etc.  That said, DOKONJOFINGER has for one reason or another proven to be very resilient and they're one of the only two bands which still do new performances today (alongside Mashumairesh!!).   ----  ## New Songs!

"My Thoughts on Mobile Suit Gundam MS IGLOO: The Hidden One Year War and Apocalypse 0079 I'm doing these together because they're intrinsically connected story and character wise and they're just 6 episodes all together.  I've come to notice that the Gundam installments that are super short like this aren't usually that good.  That's not to say a Gundam series has to be 40-50 episodes to be good, I mean most of the recent ones are much shorter than that, and the last one I watched, Superior Defender Gundam Force, was 52 episodes, the longest one I've seen yet, and it was awful.  But these shorter series that take place within the Universal Century timeline are unnecessary.  Story and character wise I don't think they ruin anything that's already been established in Universal Century, but they don't advance anything either, and these ones are no exception, unfortunately.      And that's not even the worst part of the series.  The CGI is terrible.  Funnily enough it's not the worst CGI I've ever seen in anime, but that doesn't mean it's good.  It does not hold up in the slightest.  The facial expressions are so over the top and exaggerated, which can sometimes work in traditional animation, but are so bad in CGI that I would sometimes chuckle or laugh ironically.  Another moment where I laughed in a way that the creators definitely didn't intend is in episode 1 of the Hidden One Year War, where one of the soldier dudes is blowing up at this chick, and she barely touches him and he flies halfway across the room; and no, the animation is nowhere near good enough to make it resemble an epic moment.      If it wasn't for the crappy visuals I'd say it was just unnecessary, but the CGI made it painful to watch a times.  Thankfully, it was short.",anime,1klhc6w

"Anime that hooked you fast? Like within 3 episodes? Hey, can you guys could recommend some anime that really pull you in within the first three episodes?  Lately I’ve noticed that if an anime doesn’t grab me early like within the first 3 eps, I just kinda drop it. I know that’s a crappy habit since some amazing shows take time to build up, but my attention span has gone downhill lately and I can’t help it lol  I wasn’t like this when I first got into anime. I could binge an entire season in a day or two without blinking. Now I need something that really hits right away.  The only ones I can remember recently that totally hooked me were Demon Slayer, Frieren, The Apothecary Diaries, Jujutsu Kaisen, Haikyuu, AOT, HXH and No Game No Life. I literally couldn’t stop watching and even ended up reading the manga because I was too impatient to wait for the next release  I’m not super into romance but I’m open to anything if it’s really engaging from the start. Thanks!",anime,1kkclbt

Born in 1968, his career starts as a key animator in late 80s and early 90s work like Xanadu Dragonslayer Densetsu, Idol Angel Welcome Yoko and the fourth Dragonball Z movie. He'd elevate to an Animation Director by the mid 90s with the OVA Starship Girl Yamamoto Yoko and also do some mechanical design for various OVAs around this time. He'd continue as an animator and animation director for a number of years, working on stuff like FLCL, Mezzo Forte, Jin-Rou, Overman King Gainer and Dunbuster 2 and started getting some experience as episode director by the early 2000s on works such as ROD the TV, Bleach and Speed Grapher. With Shin Sekai Yori he took on the series director role for the first time. He would also do storyboards for 6 of the 25 episodes.

"Pride Month Rewatch 2025 Interest Thread: Takako Shimura Adapted Works (Aoi Hana, Hourou Musuko & Happy Go Lucky Days) April showers bring May flowers, and… maybe even some sweet blues ones? Pride Month approaches!  [](#yuristare)  #A Rewatch For Pride Month!  If you’re not familiar, a [Rewatch]( is a longstanding passtime on this subreddit. You can think of it like a book club, where all the participants watch an anime from years past and share their thoughts on each episode in the (generally) daily threads. Anyone is welcome to participate, whether they are *literal* rewatchers or completely new to the series in question.  So a year ago (give or take my week of absentmindedness…), our Rosa Lilium /u/lilyvess proposed a [Pride Month themed rewatch]( to celebrate the 20th anniversary of some foundational works of yuri, Kannazuki no Miko and Maria-sama ga Miteru Season 1. Trials and tribulations aside, it was a great success and a prospective foundation for a new /r/anime tradition. So stepped up I to take the title of Rosa Lilium and deliver upon to you all a Pride Month Rewatch for 2025. What would that Rewatch be? Well…  [](#lesbians)  #The Legacy of Takako Shimura  There’s a long history of LGBTQA+ themes in anime and manga, but one of the most resounding names through that history is Takako Shimura, a mangaka who’s been writing manga with implicit and explicit queer content for nearly thirty years now. Her two most famous works have beloved if incomplete anime adaptations, and another of her manga got a recent movie, making her adapted works fit perfectly into a month-long Rewatch.   First is the classic Aoi Hana (Sweet Blue Flowers), a yuri series with Class S influences. While last year’s Rewatch showed yuri’s rise to prominence in anime, Aoi Hana was released five years later in late 2009 and represents a closing chapter on the period of works created under the immediate influence of Marimite; its manga was likewise released in the peak of Marimite’s popularity as a light novel series. It follows a high school girl, Fumi Manjoume, trying to navigate a new period of her life at her new all-girls school. Two meetings will come to define her first year: a reunion with her childhood friend Akira Okudaira and a fateful first meeting with senior Yasuko Sugimoto.  The middle chapter of the Rewatch will be the most recent adaptation, the 2020 film Happy Go Lucky Days. Despite this, it's the oldest of the three source materials. It published from 2002 to 2004 in Manga Erotics F, an underground magazine for ""artsy sex comics"". For our purposes, the film explores topics of sexuality but is not explicit in nature. It's also the rare adaptation of an anthology series to anime form. I haven’t seen it myself and have heard mixed things, so all I can offer is an open mind and a basic outline. It adapts three stories; one focuses on adult sapphic characters, another on a student and teacher at an all boys school, and the last is not queer but retains a focus on sexuality, specifically sexual awakenings in younger characters. Rather than focusing on narrative persay, I’ve heard it focuses more on depicting ordinary people in a “snapshots of life” kind of fashion.  Finally, we’ll be watching Hourou Musuko (Wandering Son), famous for being one of the very few anime focused directly upon transgender characters. Unusually adapting a middle slice of the (rather long) manga, the anime focuses on friends Shuichi Nitori, a transgender girl, and Yoshino Takatsuki, a transmaculine character. It’s a famously slow drama series, and there isn’t an especially big plot hook to offer beyond the premise. It’s an exploration of two kids just trying to live their lives and find out who they are while navigating their school lives. I’ve only watched part of it in the past and will be finishing it for the first time with all of you, but I can attest it’s very emotionally powerful and engrosses the viewer in the many struggles of young transgender life.  [](#ilovethiskindofshit)  #When And Where?  Availability is a bit of a mixed bag this time around. Aoi Hana, at least, is plenty available. You can find it on Crunchyroll and Apple TV+, and there’s an old Youtube release by Nozomi Entertainment if you like yellow subtitles and oldschool 480p quality. Happy Go Lucky Days is on Hidive, and it’s also listed on Amazon Prime Video but as not available in my region, so mileage may vary. Finally, Hourou Musuko was removed from Crunchyroll several years ago and is not legally available anywhere. You’re going to need to turn to the seven seas for this one.  * **Streaming (Aoi Hana)**: [Crunchyroll]( | [Apple TV+]( |  [Youtube]( * **Streaming (Happy Go Lucky Days)**: [Hidive]( | [Prime Video](  * **Streaming (Hourou Musuko)**: None * **Databases (Aoi Hana)**: [MAL]( | [Anilist]( | [ANN]( | [aniDB](  * **Databases (Happy Go Lucky Days)**: [MAL]( | [Anilist]( | [ANN]( | [aniDB](  * **Databases (Hourou Musuko)**: [MAL]( | [Anilist]( | [ANN]( | [aniDB](    The Rewatch will begin on **June 1st**.

"What are your favorite anime tropes? Seeing people telling about their least favorite tropes makes me want to ask the other way around. What are your favorite tropes in anime that you don't mind to see or wanted to see more of?  For me, one of them would be ""mythology gags"" as it would give a die-hard fans of certain media the ""fanservice"" they could have, for example like how Gundam 00 has many callbacks to the various Gundam series that previously aired, like how the ""Trans-Am"" thing could be a reference to the 'three times faster"" memes of Char's red Zaku. Or how the main antagonist of the second season having many references to the character his voice actor played in the original Gundam series.

"Show by Rock!! 10th Anniversary Rewatch - Mashumairesh!! Episode 1 Discussion # ***Mashumairesh!! Episode 1: White Startline***  [← Previous]( | [Index]( | [Next Episode →](  &nbsp;  **Series Information:** [MAL]( | [AP]( | [AL]( | [ANN]( | [aniDb](   ----  ## *NOT* New ~~Band~~ Characters! + Bonus Songs... sort of...  Obviously we've got a new band forming here, but I'll leave the formal introduction until tomorrow because first I need to explain how something weird is going on with these characters. This *band* is new... but the characters aren't.  Now for those who don't already know, Sanrio's whole image and company-wide branding is all about their ***characters***, proudly boasting how they have hundreds of different official Sanrio characters so everyone can find the Sanrio friend that is right for them, and so on (and every one of those characters is a separate IP/universe with additional secondary characters...). You don't browse a list of ""Sanrio Media Franchises"" on the Sanrio website, you browse [the enormous catalogue of main characters]( Though for Sanrio franchises with a lot of separate characters and no one ""main"" character (like *Show by Rock!!*) they're instead called ""character projects"" and bundled together as just one entry in the catalogue - good thing, too, or this catalogue would be too large to even load the webpage. (Nevermind that many of these characters who are separate in the catalogue are nevertheless from the same franchise/universe, like Kuromi and My Melody or Hello Kitty and Dear Daniel... it's not consistent, don't worry about it.)  Anyways, the point is that Sanrio is always coming out with new characters and character projects every year in a sort of ""throwing the kitchen sink at the wall and see what sticks"" approach. Who knows if this new idea for a [talking hamburger character]( will be the next big thing like Gudetama or just another PePePePengiin, let's try it and find out! If it underperforms so what, we have a dozen more characters in development, something is going to go viral eventually! Sanrio is constantly debuting weird ideas for new characters/projects, most of which don't catch on and you'll probably never hear of them. And when some exec at Sanrio has an idea for how the company should try to get into a new media space they'll almost always come up with some new character to be the face of it.  This isn't some big shared universe thing, either. Almost every single new character/project is its own separate IP in its own separate world that only has token crossovers with other Sanrio IPs at best. Maybe that's intentional since so many of them will fail to gain much traction and be quietly shelved after a little while.  Hence, every character in *Show by Rock!!* is an original character made only for *Show by Rock!!*. And same goes for *Aggretsuko*, and *Rilu Rilu Fairilu*, and *Fragaria Memories*, and so on. Separate universes, separate lore, separate characters. When you reach the top 10 of the Sanrio Annual Character Ranking Contest you might get some big crossover events with Hello Kitty but it's still going to be a multi-verse sort of thing. That's just how it is 99% of the time.  So you can imagine the surprise and confusion of some Sanrio fans when they suddenly announced in late November of 2019: ""Surprise! Guess what? We've made a new *Show by Rock!!* mobile game and a new anime series, they're both coming out in January! And here's a preview of one of the new bands!"" and then instead of a brand new set of characters like the previous twenty seven SB69 bands had been... a bunch of existing Sanrio characters with no ties to *Show by Rock!!* appeared on screen instead.  &nbsp;  First up, **Howan** was created back in either 2017 or early 2018 to be the mascot of the Sanrio Animestore. There's a dozen or so different [Sanrio stores]( in Tokyo where you can find merch, clothes, gifts, etc, related to the most popular Sanrio characters like Hello Kitty, Pompompurin, Kuromi, Cinnamoroll, Tuxedosam, Gudetama, etc. But if you want to find merch for the more otaku-oriented Sanrio projects like *Show by Rock!!*, *Aggretsuko*, *Mai Mai Mai Goen*, *Fragaria Memories*, etc there's only one official store - the Sanrio Animestore in Ikkebukuro (and their online shopping site, of course). (It even used to have [an interactive Cyan display](  In 2018 you'd find Howan all over the website, a big cut-out of her at the front of the store, her face on the [store's receipts]( etc., and eventually later on there was even an interactive touch screen Howan at the store that you could play with or which gave visitors information about the store. In July they started releasing an online comic about her [misadventures working there]( Then they decided Howan should record some songs and do collaboration events with other stores... I'm not sure what that means exactly, but anyways they hired [Hikaru Tono]( to play her - you'd probably know her best nowadays as the voice actress of Anna from *Too Many Losing Heroines*, but as far as I can tell getting hired to voice Howan the Sanrio Animestore mascot in 2018 was one of her first or maybe even THE first role she ever had.  Of course, Howan's first song became the store soundtrack which was played on an infinite loop inside the store, and they even had [little meet-and-greet events]( with Hikaru Tono when the song was first released. It went so well they recorded a second song, too.  Howan original song #1 - [Magical Love Words](  Howan original song #2 - [Goodbye Thank You!](  Howan [still is the Animestore mascot to this day]( though far more identified with *Show by Rock!!*/Mashumariesh!! than that anymore. The branding is all a bit jumbled - even her original comics from 2018 are listed under a *Show by Rock!!* banner on the website (alongside later comics from after the start of 2020 where they transformed it into more of a *Show by Rock!!* weekly comic).  &nbsp;  Next up, **Himeko** was a Sanrio V-Tuber (yes, Sanrio has experimented with being a V-Tuber agency several times) that ""debuted"" in December of 2018, played by Yūko Natsuyoshi. Similar to Hikaru Tono, this seems to have been her first notable gig of any sort but ended up becoming a launchpad into becoming a professional voice actor, and she also now has a musical duo project called [Arika]( with composer/guitarist Yamato.  Himeko mainly streamed on Showroom so there aren't any VODs of her streams still around, but her Youtube channel still exists and has a few clips of... [something]( I dunno I don't speak Japanese. The fish is her manager and sidekick. There's a bit of [Hello Kitty]( and [SB69]( karaoke on there, too.  As many V-Tubers do, Himeko eventually released an original song - Arco Color. There's both a [full verson]( and a shorter version that has [a very V-Tuber-ish MV](  She was still active as a V-Tuber at the time that Mashumairesh!! was announced, and continued doing occasional streams past the announcement, even having the other Mashumairesh!! girls be guests on her stream, but it gradually wound down and stopped altogether sometime in early 2020, I believe.  &nbsp;  Thirdly, **Delmin** was announced as a new Sanrio character in [March of 2019]( with Delmin being her actual name while also having the moniker ""DJDEVILMINTKIRYU"". They also didn't reveal who was performing as her at first, but it looks/sounds to me like it was indeed always Misaki Watada right from the start. Unlike Hikaru Tono and Yūko Natsuyoshi, this wasn't Misaki Watada's first notable role, but she was still a relative rookie voice actor/performer.  The first thing Sanrio did with Delmin was have her be their representative in the mobile game *#Compass*, which is an arena battle game where original characters represent certain vocaloid producers, all the playable characters have an original song made by their associated producer, and Hatsune Miku voices a weird robot god that brought all the heroes into a multi-verse thingy. Delmin was added to that game in April 2019, along with her first (and only) original song [Dance Floor of the Planet]( And yes, of course, there is an [official Hatsune Miku version](  Coincidentally, *#Compass* has its own [anime TV series]( which is airing right now and Delmin has had a few small cameos so far.  But beyond being the Sanrio *#Compass* character, Delmin's main thing was the [""DEVILMINTKIRYUPROJECT""]( which was basically that Sanrio wanted to have their own DJ who would perform at some Sanrio events (both live events and online streams) and why would Sanrio just get a regular DJ when they can make up a new official Sanrio character! It's the Sanrio way! There's not a lot of info out there on the web about it, but there were indeed at least a handful of events in 2019 which Delmin [did the DJ'ing for]( This continued slightly into 2020 so there was some overlap between her continuing to DJ events and being in *Show by Rock!!*, but as far as I can tell it hasn't happened again since 2020.  &nbsp;  And then there's **Ruhuyu** who... nope! Unlike her bandmates Ruhuyu *is* a brand new character made just for *Show by Rock!!*.  But someone on the Sanrio planning/marketing side had the very clever idea of producing and releasing a Ruhuyu ""character song"" - [Cinematic Memoir]( - in late 2019 before the new game and anime launched so that they could sell a set of the four characters' original songs in the lead-up to the new game/anime's launch. How clever.  She also did a series of silly [""variety content""-style promo videos]( on the official channel in the lead-up to the launch.  She's played by Aya Yamane who was also a rookie VA/performer, though it's not her first ever role (I think that would be the obscure 2018 gacha game *Arca Last* and it's associated idol group Kleissis that they made in a cynical bid to try and boost the game's visibility but it didn't work and the game was a huge flop so the idol group almost immediately disba- What?! They're still going?! They had a live show last year?!)  &nbsp;  When they first announced this it raised all sorts of interesting possibilities. If the door was open for this, did that mean the Sanrio Danshi boys could become a *Show by Rock!!* band? Or could  Aggretsuko universe have a part?! It would make a LOT of sense for Beatcats to be in the same universe as *Show by Rock!!*...   But nothing else like that ever happened - these 3 characters are the only ones who ever crossed over into *Show by Rock!!* and it doesn't seem like there was ever any plans to do any other sort of expansion, it was just these 3 characters.  So... why do this instead of just making up new characters like every prior *Show by Rock!!* band? They made up well over a hundred original *Show by Rock!!* characters but couldn't come up with 3 more?  The answer is: who knows! As best I can tell nobody at Sanrio has ever answered it.  But my speculation is that it really just comes down to someone at Sanrio realizing that they had gotten some pretty talented performers playing Howan/Himeko/Delmin, seeing potential for them to do more than the limited projects they were currently in, and wanting to make use of their talent. After some initial experimentation, Sanrio didn't really keep trying to get into the V-Tuber space in 2018/2019 (though they would come back to it again in ~2023) so Himeko was stuck as a bit of an orphaned character without much future plans for expanding into more Sanrio V-tubers. Howan meanwhile... well, what do you even do with a store mascot beyond putting her face on all the branding and releasing a new song once a year or so? As for Delmin, I think they actually planned to keep having her DJ more live events while also being in *Show by Rock!!*, but COVID soon put a lid on any of *those* plans.  We'll never know for sure, but I think most likely it was just a sort of happenstance that brought these characters and their performers together at the right place and right time to be transformed into a *Show by Rock!!* band... which is strangely fitting with their band's in-universe lore.   If you actually read this far congratulations and thanks for reading; hope you found it neat because there's no final conclusion and it doesn't matter at all for the anime.  ----  ## New Songs!  Mashumairesh!! - [White Startline (Howan version)]( | This is the piece which played as Howan took the train. It's a Howan-only solo version in the episode here, but [the main version]( has all four girls singing. There are also solo versions by each of the other 3 girls - a lot of Mashumairesh songs had bonus CDs released with solo versions from each of them.  Mashumairesh!! - [Yell and Response]( | This mixed the regular version with the Himeko solo version ([only upload I can find is this]( but the quality isn't very good) since Howan doesn't join in right away.  Mashumairesh!! - [Your Rhapsody]( | Not only are there all the solo versions of this song, but the game also had a ""DJ version"" remixed by Delmin which I don't think was ever released anywhere else [but here's the game footage of it.](  Criticrista - [Attention Please!]( | This plays *extremely* faintly in the background of part of the scene in the studio lobby around 13:00 into the episode.   ----  ## Question of the Day  [Q] No isekai, no aliens, no giant evil monsters... how do you feel about this much more grounded introduction to a series/season?    ----  ## Tomorrow's Question of the Day  [Q] >!Character designs!

[Mashumairesh!!](  A 4-member band of young women who serendipitiously met each other in the Under North Zawa area of MIDI City. And yes, the two exclamation marks are officially part of their band name.  As a few of you have already noted, Mashumairesh!!'s musical style is very much the modern anime-oriented pop-rock musical style that you see in franchises like Love Live! They're instrumentation is not especially diagetic either, with a lot of their songs having piano or orchestral strings or synthesizer effects, though the guitar/bass/drums are almost always still the main instruments.  Mashumairesh!! was first announced in late 2019 alongside the reveal of the second mobile game and new anime series, which came after a couple years of relative stagnation for the franchise. Mashumairesh!! was to be the vanguard of the new bands and new stories of a renewed franchise, arguably even taking over the role of the franchise's flagship band from Plasmagica, or at least putting them on about equal footing.  After all, a lot of the performers from the old band weren't really interested in doing the live shows anymore. 8 years can be a long time to be attached to a franchise like this if it's not a career-defining role for you. So this ""phase 3"" of the franchise needed new blood. Perhaps for that reason, Mashumairesh!! is one of the few *Show by Rock!!* bands populated entirely by rookie performers.  The other thing that sets Mashumairesh!! apart in *Show by Rock!!* is that [they actually play their instruments]( at live shows.   Of course when clammbon or SILHOUETTE FROM THE SKYLIT [perform at one of the SB69 live concerts]( they play their instruments - they're real professional bands that (mostly) don't voice their characters, and all their songs are the same as the real band. But when the original-music bands perform [it's more like an idol show]( with live vocals only over backing tracks. Most of their performers are voice actors/idols who can't play an instrument anyways, but even the ones who can play an instrument don't here.  Mashumairesh!! is the exception to that. Just like happened with *K-On!* and *Bang Dream*, someone decided (maybe it was the performers themselves, but probably not?) that the Mashumairesh!! performers should actually learn their instruments, with them declaring at their announcement that their goal was to be able to play some of their songs decently at the 2020 3969 festival show about a year later. Fans would be encouraged to follow along/cheer on their progress and the official YouTube channel would do semi-regular mini-documentaries on their learning and rehearsal progress every month or so. Then COVID happened... and the 2020 3969 festival show did still eventually happen as an online stream but it was a bit of a disaster. But eventually they did reach their goal and demonstrated at some live shows in 2021 that they can indeed play most of their songs pretty decently.   ----  ## New Songs!

So I wanted to see if by any slim chance someone else may know what I'm talking about!!  Basically, I know it's an older anime about a girl in a tower. Pretty sure she has orange/reddish hair. There's magic in the show (at least I'm prett sure there is). And there's a castle on a lake and a dragon/creature who like lives either in or around the castle/lake. There's a dark haired boy who visits the girl/is friends with her. She goes to this ball? Thing and something is revealed that shocks everyone (I think she's may actually be the daughter of someone important?).Pretty sure she has a green amulet (which for some reason is the specific thing my mind is focused on). I think she gets taken away or locked in the tower?  Thought it was Tsubasa Chronicles for a while, but it's not that. I think definitely around the same time as that though?

"I forgot the name of the anime i watch is just tip of my tongue Hello, I'm trying to remember the name of an anime I watched, but I can’t seem to find it anywhere. I’ve gone through search tools and lists, but nothing fits the scenes I recall. It might be lesser-known or not talked about much. Here are the details I remember:  The main character is a high school boy, and the anime has romance, harem, and school life themes.  Two girls are his exes — one is a childhood friend, and the other is from high school.  Both of them made his life difficult in the past, and the story seems to revolve around them trying to make up for it or reconnect.  The tone is a mix of emotional and comedic. There’s nothing supernatural, horror, or science fiction involved.  His sister is also part of the story. One scene shows her kissing him under a bridge. There’s also a memory of her pushing him from a monkey bar-like structure, which caused an injury. She feels guilty about it.  There’s a scene where the two exes overhear something he says, which surprises them.  One of the exes is a basketball player who was invited to a club but refused unless the MC joined. He later ends up playing basketball, possibly in a setup where she wanted him to lose so he’d join.  The MC’s father is absent or unknown, though the parents are mentioned.   It doesn’t seem to be a popular or well-known title idk, so I’d really appreciate it if anyone recognizes these scenes. Thanks in advance.",anime,1kk58pv

"[TOMT][Anime][Movie?] Trying to identify an anime film I saw before 2010 involving two brothers, swords, and a third eye Hi! I'm trying to remember the name of an anime (possibly a movie or OVA) [TOMT][Anime][Movie?] Trying to identify an anime film I saw before 2010 involving two brothers, swords, and a third eye  Hi! I'm trying to remember the name of an anime (possibly a movie or OVA) I watched on DVD before 2010, likely mid-2000s or earlier. It had a medieval Asian fantasy setting, no modern technology.  Here are the details I remember:  The story focused on two brothers, both swordsmen.  The older or darker-haired brother had long hair and a saber-like sword with 2 chain links or segments at the tip.  At some point, he gains a demonic power — he awakens on a boat with a third eye on his forehead, which is initially closed.  The main protagonist wakes up in slums or a city and befriends a young girl, part of a group of orphans or thieves.  They later get trapped or ambushed together.  The story involves a slug- or leech-like creature, possibly glowing gold or green, that grants or transfers power.  Near the end, the girl stabs the protagonist with a golden sword to free him from the dark influence — and may lose her sight temporarily.  The protagonist may have had a dragon tattoo, and the film had some magic, but the brothers were mainly sword fighters, not wizards.   It felt serious, slightly dark, and mystical, like a Wuxia fantasy.  I've checked known titles like Inuyasha, 3x3 Eyes, Sword of the Stranger, and Basilisk, but none fit.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?",anime,1kl22x4
"Need anime recommandations: That is romance with heavy drama involved. I really liked Love and Lies, Domestic girlfriend and Scums wish.   For me personally i find constant happiness in anime romances boring, because im already living a happy relationship.  Which is why the romances with alot of drama is always so much fun, the running, clouds forming and rain pouring, screaming, love triangle or hidden love is so entertaining. You just can't stop watching it.  My crazy take is, its also more realistic, Relationships are supposed to have arguments, and maybe sometimes drama, thats how they develop or perish depending on how strong the love is.  My second requst if someone's seen Love and lies, I really liked Sanada, Ririna character, so if there's any similar characters like her, that would be really fun.

"How could ""Sister princess"" could become better? I know it is not a good anime but still I love it. I watched it whilst on Unis outside my home town and then I missed my sister (we are good siblings) so I wonder how could this anime become better.     My approach is a man who's father was a sailor has passed away, but whilst was alive he did cheat his wife upon his travels and as a result our protagonis has little sisters around the world. Upon his will he inherited a fragment of a necklace and has to travel around the world to find the missing fragments that each sister has.      The last fragment is owned by a mermaid that was also his childhood friend. If combined with a Greek-island setting I think the story becomes 100% better.

So they race for some reason, the boy and alien. There were 2 specific scenes i remember, the boy goes into a red path, which then closes and opens for a blue path for the alien to take. The red path had a bunch of red spheres as big or even bigger than the racecar, that were going opposite to the boy, and the blue spheres were assisting the alien. The alien gets ahead and stops in front of the end, which was a section that was being periodically blocked by a big wall that moves left to right really quickly. The boy instead speeds up and goes through and wins. There was a big flashing light that appears for a couple seconds after reaching the finish line.

"Need help remembering an anime This is kind of weird, cause I only remember one specific scene and nothing else. Basically there's 2 guys and 1 girl, they're all friend, A and B are the guys, C is the girl. At some point, A tells B that he's going to confess to the girl (I remember this happening in the school gym but I'm not entirely sure) and to come listen to the confession. Then B goes, but is too distant, and can't hear what's actually being said, which is that A in reality is saying that he's gay and has always been in love with B, and C, the girl, after discovering the thing with surprise, encourages A to try and that she's going to help him succeed.

One takes care of the girl. From what I saw (this is from a distant memory) the environment was very dark and disturbing. I believe (could be wrong) some kind of experiments were going on.

"I’m a 37 year old woman and I freaking LOVE Dragon Ball That’s it. That’s the post.  There’s just like, NO ONE in my peer group I can talk to about this. I’ve been an anime fan since the late 90s and grew up with Adult Swim in my teens. But I totally slept on Dragon Ball and now that I’ve seen all the mainline series (I’m getting to the movies soon), MAN I freaking love this franchise.   I find the hardcore fans to be pretty intense because I’m not taking the story TOO seriously (so many timelines and plot holes etc), but it’s just so damn enjoyable to watch.  I guess I just feel kind of weird about it cuz here I am a woman in her late 30s who gets freaking Botox to try and stop the cruel march of time but also walks into the med spa with a jacket that has a capsule corp patch on it.

"Orb: On the Movements of the Earth was phenomenal I just recently finished this amazing show, but I just want to share how amazing it is.  I dont watch much anime anymore like I used to years ago, but initially gave it a try because of its unique premise and just...wow.  Its rare for a show to not only have a unique structure and premise, but to actually explore themes you rarely see explored in a lot of media as well with an impressive sophistication.  This show really has a lot of ""meat"" to it, thematically heavy and dare I say actually profound. I feel like people say stuff like that way too lightly normally, but in this case I really feel like its true.  I read that the original author apparently studied Philosophy... and that makes actually a lot of sense having seen the show.  If you want a fully completed show that is unique, doesnt repeat or focus on  the same tired themes, this is the show for you.",anime,1k2b28h

"So, How Much Money Do Anime Studios Actually Make? - Official Gazette Numbers The short answer is not that much.  In 2021, [Teikoku Databank]( reported that around 40% of anime studios were in the red. But you should note that most of the studios struggling financially aren’t the big names you usually hear about. In fact, a lot of the large and well-known studios today have started appearing more commonly on production committees which has improved their financial position.  Now, Japan’s Official Gazette is a public journal issued by the Japanese government that sometimes includes financial disclosures from companies. However, fewer than 2% of Japanese companies actually publish their financial reports there.  I did some digging through the Gazette and managed to gather numbers from 25 different anime studios that have released financial reports at least once over the past five years. Most of the numbers are from each studio’s 2024 fiscal year, though a few are from earlier years, check the notes for those.  ### Here's the list:  ---   | Rank | Studio Name             | Net Profit (¥) | Retained Earnings (¥) | Notes       | |------|-------------------------|----------------:|----------------------:|-------------| | 1    | Studio Ghibli          | 4.97 billion    | 30.2 billion          |             | | 2    | Bandai Namco Filmworks | 3.76 billion    | 9.91 billion          | (2021FY)    | | 3    | Production I.G.        | 358 million     | N/A                   |             | | 4    | WIT Studio             | 271 million     | N/A                   |             | | 5    | CloverWorks            | 203 million     | 342.8 million         |             | | 6    | Marza Animation Planet | 83.5 million    | 335 million           |             | | 7    | Kinema Citrus          | 72.6 million    | 154.6 million         |             | | 8    | CygamesPictures        | 63 million      | -395 million          |             | | 9    | Studio Chiptune        | 61.2 million    | 55.9 million          |             | | 10   | Colorido               | 28 million      | -4.4 million          | (2021FY)    | | 11   | Kusanagi               | 27 million      | 480 million           |             | | 12   | A-1 Pictures           | 25 million      | 754.5 million         |             | | 13   | ENGI                   | 5 million       | -202 million          |             | | 14   | Studio Boundary        | 4.5 million     | -61.8 million         |             | | 15   | Studio Gaina           | 1.4 million     | -214.9 million        | (2022FY)    | | 16   | SHIN-EI Animation      | 1 million       | 7.7 million           |             | | 17   | Studio Ponoc           | 759 thousand    | 136 million           | (2020FY)    | | 18   | Scooter Films          | -10.7 million   | 3.5 million           |             | | 19   | Kyoto Animation        | -21.3 million   | 1.1 billion           | (2020FY)    | | 20   | Studio Mother          | -27 million     | -27 million           | (2020FY)    | | 21   | Studio 8bit            | -204 million    | -975 million          |             | | 22   | Tatsunoko Productions  | -224 million    | 848 million           |             | | 23   | Studio ACTAS           | -230 million    | -852 million          |             | | 24   | Studio KAI             | -248 million    | -1.484 billion        |             | | 25   | Seven Arcs             | -782 million    | -433 million          | (2022FY)    |  --- ### Notes:  - I used [these]( [two]( sites to find the numbers.   - The numbers for WIT Studio and Production I.G come from IG Port’s financial reports, not the Official Gazette.   - Most of the studios listed here are subsidiaries of larger companies, each with their own unique context. A studio losing money in the short term doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not achieving its purpose.  Let me know if I made any mistake with the numbers.  **Edit:** Just to clarify since some people are confused. These numbers are only for the studios that have disclosed their financial data in the Official Gazette, which represents a small portion of the anime industry. This isn’t a ranking of the entire industry, just of the few studios that made their numbers public on the Gazette.",anime,1k3uzlw

"Made a bet with my Dad, need good adult oriented anime suggestions Hey guys, I’m looking for anime suggestions for my Dad that are absolute knock outs and more cinematic with not only cool action but an engaging story.  Some background context. I just moved back in with my parents at 30yrs old, I’ve been a otaku my whole life, I grew up on final fantasy, toonami, Tokyo pop publication, shonen jump magazine, and sketchy sites when you had to watch anime in like 6 different parts before Crunchyroll. In contrast to my Dad who is super into sports and was only really into Star Wars and Marvel/DC comics when he was younger. Oddly enough my Dad absolutely hates anime and it drives me crazy because he doesn’t have a real reason. He liked the live action Yu Yu Hakusho on Netflix but as soon as me and my older brother mentioned it was an anime while he was watching it, he backed out of it and just stopped watching it altogether, now he says it sucks and refuses to even finish the series that he was loving.   I finally talked him into a bet that I could show him an anime and if he didn’t like it he would win an agreed amount of money. The rules are he has to watch the entire series which would have to be around like 25 episodes max(I can’t show him something like One Piece), I must also be in the room with him for every episode he watches, and he must give his thoughts after every episode so I know he actually watched it. So I really need a banger that he cannot dispute is bad, I’m open to suggestions.   If you guys have any strong suggestions please let me know. Also I’m trying to avoid series I grew up on that’s he’s somewhat familiar with like Dragon Ball and Naruto because he just thinks they’re too immature and for kids. We always do bets like this so I might try to double or nothing with another series too afterward.   UPDATE: hey guys, had a busy day today, I’m so surprised to come home and see hundred of individual responses in the comments. You all are so passionate and it’s great to see you all taking this to heart and doing your best to help me.  I’m going through all the comments and narrowing down the first series I’m going to show him as I believe this bet will not stop at just 1 anime. If you guys are interested I can record his reaction and his thoughts between episodes? I asked him if he would be okay with it and he said yes.",anime,1k0rp9t

If you continue an episode you have to quit out and search the series again as it wont automatically sequence the next episode.  Like I'm not a programmer but I imagine we had a better platform in the 1980s than this,anime,1keztoo
"Best Run of Anime Endings of an Anime series? (InuYasha) straight four years of top tier endings.  longevity, and consistency wise.  the only series that comes to mind that is close is YuYu Hakusho...  if it released one more it could have overtaken InuYasha, imo.",anime,1kap89r
"I’ve hooked my girlfriend on anime? What should she watch next? Recently, I convinced my girlfriend to give anime a try, and she reluctantly accepted. I decided to have her watch death note, and she was instantly intrigued. We’re on episode 8 rn, and she’s itching to watch more, which makes me very happy 👏🏾👏🏾 She almost shed a tear when Light took a potato chip, and ATE IT. But based on her excitement she’s going to plow through this show with me.. and I don’t really know what should be next. For some background info, she’s 18 I’m 17, I watch mainstream, action types of anime, most ppl have heard of every anime I’ve watched, my top 3 is one piece, hxh, and blue lock. I’ve seen a good bit but not that many. For her, this is ofc her first anime, but she’s usually into dramas, romcoms, stuff like that. I’ve been thinking about doing Naruto next, but I wanted some input from the council before I made a decision.  TLDR: I need a recommendation for a good anime for me and my newborn anime fan of a gf, she’s only watched death note and really likes it so far (episode 8).  FEED ME YOUR BEST RECCOMENDATIONS",anime,1kioz5m

"What’s your least favorite anime trope? My least favorite trope is the love interest whose only personality or motivation is being madly in love with the MC. Like when the MC saves a girl on the first episode, and the girl becomes madly in love with them and sticks to the MC like glue. These are the worst, because they really add nothing to the show, and they sometimes even cause issues for the MC because the MC just goes along with it. Im not saying romance is bad. Romance can make a great storyline. But when these love interests never develop into their own and remain surface level characters, it infuriates me and even lessens my opinion of the show as a whole if the MC ends up with them.",anime,1kiebd5
"The Wind Breaker anime is a hidden gem! It's surprisingly underrated. It's a lot better than I originally expected! I'm currently watching season 2 of Wind Breaker and it's honestly amazing! The characters are great. Sakura is a great protagonist. He's a great combination between a badass and a dork. He has some really good character development, despite still blushing. I guess this is the charm of the Tsundere XD   The plot isn't anything mind-blowing, but it works well enough. The animation is great and fights have very good choreography.   But I rarely see people talking about it. Which is a shame, because the show is pretty good and it deserves more recognition. I've read the manga and it gets even better in the next arcs.   These are just my thoughts. I would like to hear yours.",anime,1k1dpcz

"Uma Musume Cinderella Grey is hugely slept on rn (IN ALL SERIOUSNESS) If I was asked which episode of this anime hooked me I would say since episode 1. In a series where almost nothing is average, everything from animation to characters are superb; it feels weird that this level of anime is not getting enough attention. I get it tho every season there are bunch of anime to choose from and if an anime does really well, it all comes down to mouth publicity from the fans. Since I don't see it getting popular anyway despite its quality, I had to give a shout out: GIVE THIS A CHANCE!  It checks all the boxes of being an awesome anime. Its funny even Hilarious at times, a story of an underdog racing girl who is aiming for the top. Btw I never watched any previous seasons and I didn't have to....its a standalone series.",anime,1kd3b0n

"I just finished frieren and was looking for more shows like it I don’t watch a lot of anime, but I just watched frieren and it was incredible. However, now that I’m done, I left wanting for more. Pretty much everything I tried watching like it is horribly mediocre and/or riddled with so much “fanservice” that it takes away from the plot.   A few personal things:  I’d like if it were on the *longer* side  I don’t care if the visuals are bad  I entirely *dislike fanservice*, so the less, the better  I prefer when there *aren’t too many main characters* (so not something like one piece)  I like *fantasy*  I am aro, so I don’t get much out of romance. I’m fine with it, but I don’t want it as the main focus.  I have neither the energy nor attention span for subs, so I’d like if it were *dubbed*  If you find anything, thank you, and if you are going to recommend something like jobless reincarnation, don’t.",anime,1kddfox

"Just a reminder to anime watchers to not care about the anime ratings. I am pretty sure i actually havent watched as much anime as more than half of you. Its really not that hard to find someone that has watched a thousand anime here. They are lurking in the comments. Anyways what im going to tell you is that never ever look at MAL or AL ratings. What most people doesnt realise that higher ratings only means that it appeals to a wider audience and lower ratings might mean that it appeals to a specific audience or they really are mid.  The issue comes from the fact that not everyone rates the way other people does (like 6/10 means average to me, some people vote 5/10 as average, some vote 7/10 as average). In a way it makes ratings really useless, because the numbers mean different things to everyone else.  There is also an another issue,   For example lets assume there is an anime that was rated 6/10  20 anime watchers voted it 10/10 16 anime watchers voted it 1/10   that means 55% of the anime watchers thought it was a masterpiece. (or they just rate everything they like 10/10) Its the perfect anime, yet it was rated 6/10  45% thought it was dogshit (or maybe they rated 1/10 because the anime was rated higher than their favorite at first, or they are an mal elitist who rates everything low) and lets say there is an anime that was rated 6/10  36 anime watchers thought it was mid/okay and rated it 6/10.  while these scenarios arent real and doesnt work exactly like this, it shows that 6/10 doesnt mean that its mid for everyone, it might be masterpiece for some, dogshit for some or its actually mid for everyone. so go ahead and try out animes that look interesting, dont care about the rating that much. dont let it make you afraid of trying new anime out.  if it turns out to be boring for you, you probably only lost 20-60 minutes, next time try something else and you might love it  (please dont force yourself to watch boring animes, just dont.)  Edit: I should point it out that most animes are actually 6 or 7/10  Of course if its below 5/10 its going to be shit. I am talking about especially animes that are between 6.5-8/10",anime,1k7im7u
"Clannad - Anime of the Week Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing..  [Clannad](  Tomoya Okazaki is a delinquent who finds life dull and believes he'll never amount to anything. Along with his friend Youhei Sunohara, he skips school and plans to waste his high school days away.      One day while walking to school, Tomoya passes a young girl muttering quietly to herself. Without warning she exclaims ""Anpan!"" (a popular Japanese food) which catches Tomoya's attention. He soon discovers the girl's name is Nagisa Furukawa and that she exclaims things she likes in order to motivate herself. Nagisa claims they are now friends, but Tomoya walks away passing the encounter off as nothing.      However, Tomoya finds he is noticing Nagisa more and more around school. Eventually he concedes and befriends her. Tomoya learns Nagisa has been held back a year due to a severe illness and that her dream is to revive the school's drama club. Claiming he has nothing better to do, he decides to help her achieve this goal along with the help of four other girls.      As Tomoya spends more time with the girls, he learns more about them and their problems. As he attempts to help each girl overcome her respective obstacle, he begins to realize life isn't as dull as he once thought.

"Dead/Dying Anime With Dedicated Fanbases There was a post last week that had some really interesting discussion around once popular anime/manga with dying fanbases. So, I thought it would be fun to discuss the opposite and hear that other people have to say ✨️   What are some series that are ""dying/dead"" whether it is due to long hiatuses, sudden cancelation, years between seasons with no next season in sight etc. that still have a strong presence within the anime community.   One that immediately comes to mind for me is Land of the Lustrous. Despite being riddled with hiatuses, the first season of the anime airing almost 8 years ago AND Kodansha seemingly forgetting about the English manga release (the final chapter came out April last year and we're getting the final volume this November as long as there are no delays) it still has an incredibly dedicated fanbase. I still see it mentioned often on here in ""series that need another season"" or ""series with best OST"" posts etc.",anime,1kff5ur

What's a popular anime you just could not get into after watching it? Unpopular opinion. I honestly couldn't stand Komi Can't Communicate. I was tired of people saying it was so realistic when people with social anxiety would never be as popular as that girl was. And the inability to speak is also not the same as social anxiety. A good example of realistic social anxiety would be Watamote.,anime,1dg2dse

"Momo Ayase (Dandadan) is such a refreshing female lead I’ve been watching shounen’s for over 2 decades and Momo is such a good character. Her chemistry with Okarun (the other Co lead) is amazing, her design sick (gives her multiple outfits), she’s headstrong and stubborn but also very endearing and goofy. She’s relatable (actually acts like a highschool student) but is also mature and apologizes for her mistakes. I can’t think of another female shounen character that has so much charisma as Momo does.

"Dandadan: A Brief Explanation of the Takakura Ken Joke [Dandadan episode 1 spoilers] There's a joke based around the name of the male MC of Dandadan being ""Takakura Ken"" that probably lands a lot harder for Japanese audiences familiar with the super-famous actor than Western audiences who likely don't know who he is.  So this is a brief explanation of who Takakura Ken is, and why the last few minutes of episode 1 of Dandadan are an elaborate joke around that actor's name.  [Takakura Ken \(Explosion\)](  Dandadan quickly establishes in the opening moments of the anime that Momo is a huge Takakura Ken fan, to the point where she started dating an obviously not particularly great guy simply because his looks reminded her of her beloved Ken-san (who she takes a roundhouse kick at in the opening moments of the anime).  Takakura Ken is (1931-2014) is an immensely famous Japanese actor,  He won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Actor four times, the most in Japanese Cinema history.  He starred in over 200 films.  He was also a hit singer that appeared frequently in Japan's prestigious New Years Kohaku Utagassen singing show, and was a frequent presence in Japanese commercials from the 60s onward.  He was extremely famous for his stoic persona, where he would almost invariable play a strong-silent type of guy, who is always a gentleman, doesn't show overt interest in women, but is focused on his craft and has difficulty expressing his emotions.  Ken-san's signature line actually comes from a commercial he did that ran for decades starting in the 1980s, where in selling life insurance he says ""Bukiyou desukara"" (I'm an awkward fellow).  The unspoken (and obvious to Japanese audiences) idea being ken-san struggles to show how much he cares about his loved ones, but he'll follow through with his actions and make sure they have the life insurance protection they need.   [  Ken-san is as famous and iconic to Japanese people as like say, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, or Robert De Niro.  The name instantly conjures up a certain rough, tough, stoic image of a character with a certain distinctive type of charm.  So the last few minutes of episode 1 actually demonstrate how although the male MC doesn't LOOK like Takakura Ken, he's actually WAY more like what Momo likes about Takakura Ken the actor than her ex-BF.  1. he bravely goes off to fight Turbo Granny alone because he feels responsible for himself and doesn't want to endanger Momo. 2. He has trouble expressing his emotions, being the quiet type. 3. He uses Takakura Ken's tagline ""Bukyou Desukara"" (I'm an awkward fellow) 4. He is a gentleman and shows discomfort (rather than interest) at Momo being in a state of undress, and asks her to put on some clothes since he can't talk to her in that state.  As Momo unconsciously realizes how much the MC is like her beloved Ken-san her heart picks up audibly, and she tries to laugh and play it off, asking him what his name is to distract herself from her own realization.  Then the joke is that improbably, the name of the MC turns out to be... Takakura Ken (explosion).",anime,1g94v9u

Episode 7 goes over the backstory of Acrobatic Silky, who at first glance seemed like just another monster of the week for our protagonist's to face quickly delves into a hard-hitting backstory showcasing a single mother trying her best to raise her daughter the best she can.   I won't go much into the details since that's not the point of my discussion. What caught my attention was how they crafted this entire sequence with very minimal dialogue yet it works, it worked beautifully. It was visual storytelling at its best.   Episodes like this is why I prefer anime over manga. This is why I love the medium of animation in general.

"86 is a masterpiece So I just finished watching 86, and God damn this show was a masterpiece. It was a rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish, and the ending of season 2 was perfect. Idk if we're getting a third season, but i would be perfectly happy if it is left like this.   Imo in my anime rankings, its higher than Demon Slayer (a hot take given the die hard demon slayer fandom).   Honestly people who haven't watched this **need** to watch it, and if you have, what are your thoughts on it?  EDIT:   So as a lot of you have pointed out, masterpiece may be too strong a word, however I would say that amongst many modern anime that are boring or just plain trash, 86 is a breath of fresh air. I do believe it’s an outstanding anime, and the word masterpiece is obviously subjective. Some of you guys might hold the term to a higher standard than I do. Some anime like HxH or Aot or DBZ may be considered to be better, but just because I’m calling 86 a masterpiece, doesn’t take away from the fact that they are too.   Thanks to all of you for respecting my opinion so far. I do read all of your replies even if it would be impossible for me to reply to them all. Enjoy contributing to the discussion!",anime,1erzjvj

"Japanese fans are not happy with the upcoming Sakamoto Days Anime adaptation to the point the studio started deleting negative Japanese comments from YouTube trailers I knew fans weren't happy with the adaptation that Sakamoto Days is getting so i was curious to see what the Japanese fans thought about it. To my surprise, 80-90% of the Top Japanese comments on [the Main Trailer]( and [Trailer 2]( are all negative. Especially on Trailer 2. Even the character introduction shorts they released [had a very negative reception in the comments]( On the official TMS YouTube channel, it got soo bad to the point TMS started removing comments.  Some Japanese comments under the Main Trailer(Machine Translation) -  * It's bad to have people worry about the animation in a PV...(653 likes) * I'm looking forward to it, but when I think about the animation and the voice actors of my favorite characters, I feel a little sad. (571 likes) * the animation is not that bad, but the battle scenes in the original are so amazing that it just looks soo much inferior. (502 likes) * As a reader of the original work, I was hoping for something less flat and more fast-paced... Even if it didn't sell well and they made the Order Arc, I'd imagine the animation would be the same... (348 likes) * This is a picture that lacks any sense of tension. Wouldn't it have been better to make it a bit darker overall? (136 likes) * It's sad that Sakamoto, a candidate for Jump's next flagship, is being consumed like this as an average anime Not only is the art bad, but the voice actors are not a good fit either, and I've been looking forward to it being made into an anime for a long time, so the disappointment is huge... It's a work that could carry Jump in the future, so I wish they'd taken better care of it. (110 likes) * I wanted Bones to make it... (180 likes)  Some Japanese comments from Trailer 2 (Machine Translation) -  * I thought the action in the manga was so good it would be good as an anime... (237 likes) * A rare animated work that is likely to become popular is a still image. (394 likes) * It's a candidate for Jump's flagship series. So this is the most important anime adaptation for that. Why did they leave it to TMS? (138 likes) * deleting negative comments does not change the fact that people are not happy with how TMS and Shueisha is handling one of its top series. You are just making the fans angrier. (English comment) (147 likes) * This manga, whose selling point is its dynamic and powerful action, can be made into an anime with this kind of artwork...? (145 likes) * Why does something like this happen to Lupin when the animation quality is so high? Well, there are a ton of other issues before that. (181 likes) * I'm a bit worried that there aren't any action scenes in the PV. (752 likes) * Is this kind of behavior acceptable? If I were the original author, I'd cry. (158 likes)  I dont remember the last time an upcoming anime got this much hate even before it started airing. I personally think anime [looks decent]( its not as bad as ppl are saying but its interesting to see soo much backlash from japanese side of things. I wonder if this much backlash will change anything, like how Ryu Nakayama left CSM anime after the backlash he got from Japanese side.  Edit - even the comments under [the Official Shonen Jump channel]( are also all negative",anime,1hnxdt9

"Why the official subs for My Deer Friend Nokotan/Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan were NOT made by an AI/MTL **EDIT**: It seems that the English subs have been improved in the Youtube upload and are now decent:   I haven't checked any other languages or any other platforms.  --- ---  In the current age of AI hysteria and localizer drama, with machine translation being sometimes used by publishers to rush badly translated manga and visual novels to the market, many people were quick to claim that the official, dreadful subs for My Deer Friend Nokotan/Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan on Crunchyroll were made by an ""AI"".  This cannot be further from the truth. Every mistake points to a not very competent human translator, who was also not given enough time to proofread their work. **Lack of time and lack of editing are the main culprits behind the quality of the subtitles. Not the spooky AI.**  Here are the examples that almost never happen if you use an automated tool:  >[JA] 不動明王様の庭に集う乙女たちが今日も新撰組隊士のような無垢な笑顔で玉川の流れを超えていく。  >[EN] Once again, today, the maidens who gather in the gardens of the wisdom king cross the tama river with smiles as pure as those of the shinsengumi troopers.  Comparison with actual MTL:  >[Google] The young girls who gather in the garden of Acala Buddha statue today too cross the Tamagawa River with innocent smiles like Shinsengumi soldiers.  >[DeepL] The maidens who gather in the garden of Fudo Myoo-sama cross the Tamagawa stream with innocent smiles like Shinsengumi troopers today.  Note the following:  * MTL calls the river Tamagawa, not Tama  * MTL uses proper capitalization. It's humans who are more likely to fail to capitalize words, not computers. It's very likely that the translator was rushing and hoped that they (or the editors) fix all the capitalization later. *There was no ""later"".*  * MTL keeps the proper name of [Acala/Fudō Myō-ō]( instead of replacing it with a localized title  It seems that this sentence was translated by someone with good knowledge of Japanese culture, but with not a great feel for translation.  >[JA] もうまだまだ寒いなぁ  >[EN] It’s still so coooold!  This is not a bad translation, but MTL would never prolong vowels like this.  >[EN] Erm… Thank you very much!  This is subtle, but notice that this sentence does not contain three periods, it contains a single ellipsis character. Now that's weird, why does it? Neither MTL's nor most humans use it. There are two possible answers: either automatic character substitution in Word, or someone using a non-standard keyboard layout/input method and preferring to type an ellipsis. For example, the standard Japanese input method. Anyhow, still slightly more likely that a human did it.  >[EN] Are you kidding me? We have a suicideby hanging right in the first episode?!  A missing space. MTL almost never omit spaces, humans omit spaces all the time.  >[JA] 警察？医者？こ・・くん？じゃない！はじめちゃん！  >[EN] Should I call the police? a doctor? Detective Co... No, Hajimeeeee!  (I'm not sure about the Japanese text, I guessed what it was based on the translation. Yes, the dots are what I guessed, it's the typical trademark censorship. This line, as many others, is anime-original, so I couldn't cross-reference it with manga.)  First, again, we see a prolonged vowel here. Second, a reference to Detective Conan could not be guessed by MTL, it had to be done by a human who guessed (correctly or not) the intention of the script writer.  Also, arguably missing or inconsistent capitalization. Most style guides would capitalize the ""a"", and MTL also capitalizes it.  >[JA] 東京じゃない、千葉のネズミなんたら売ってるあれかって  >[EN] Ah, that must be those things they sell at Toky, no, Chiba mo useland…  First of all, we see a misspelt Tokyo. Say one thing of computers, but they at least know how to spell one of the largest cities in the world. I'm not sure if it's a typo, or a bad attempt at interrupting the word in the middle of the syllable, but again, it's not something an MTL would do.  Second, we have ""mo useland"". Given the context, it's supposed to be ""Mouseland"", a trademark-safe reference to Tokyo Disneyland (which is actually located in Chiba). Again, bad capitalization, erroneous extra space, not something a computer would do.   But most importantly, a computer would understand ネズミ as a literal ""mouse"" or ""rat"" and would translate it to something like this:  >[Google] It's not Tokyo, it's the one selling rats in Chiba  >[DeepL] Not in Tokyo, but in Chiba, where they sell rat poison.  Proper capitalization, proper punctuation, proper spaces, no typos, but completely nonsensical.  >[JA] 気温12度  >[EN] Temperature: 53.6 °f  This one is obviously human-made, MTL doesn't convert units and then misspell them.  >[JA] べ、べ、べ、別に見捨てるわけじゃ  >[EN] N-n-n-n-no, of course not, I’d never…  A repeated letter, again a human-like feature. And again, a single-character ellipsis.  >[JA] じゃあ、ヤンキーのおね―  >[EN] Well, I’m stuck with Miss delinq...  A clipped word, something that MTL wouldn't do.  Also, ""I'm stuck with"" is not explicitly present in the original, it had to be inferred and added by a human.  >[EN] I couldn have done it without you,  An obvious human-like typo.  >[EN] Jeez, you’re going to make me do this every club meeting, arent you?  An obvious human-like typo.  EDIT: /u/alwayslonesome posted another list of examples that strongly suggest it's a human, mostly focusing on context awareness and good judgement of the translator:    ---  Okay, enough bullying the English translator, let's bully the other ones.  >[DE] („Hirsch“ is the german word for a male deer so this paragraph doesn´t make sense and can be removed)  Yes, the German sub contains a note in English left by a translator, hoping an editor makes the final decision and edits the line for readability, or at least comes back with some feedback.  Little did they know, _there was no editor_.  >[JA] おま―、んっ、んんっ、んんっ  >[EN] Hey, Y... H, hmm,  >[DE] Hey, Y... H, hm,  >[FR] Hé, Y... H, euh,  >[ES] ¡Eres una...!  Both German and French translators translated from English and failed to notice that ""Y"" is actually a clipping of ""you"", which is probably because the English translator incorrectly capitalized it. Maybe they thought it was a clipping of a name? But note they both translated the ""hmm"".  The Spanish translator didn't. Looks like an independent translation, and I think it's a better one.  >[FR] Température : 12 °C  >[DE] Temperatur: 12 °C  >[ES] Hay 12 grados celsius.  Given how it seems like they're based on the English translation, it looks like both German and French translators converted the units back. Something a human would do.  Spanish translation is more idiomatic, but fails to capitalize ""Celsius"". A typical human mistake.  >[DE] Meine dunkle Vergangenheit als Raufboldin,wurde von zu viel Shonen-Manga beeinflusst!  Random incorrect comma instead of space, without a space after it. MTL almost never forgets spaces after punctuation, it must have been the middle finger hitting the wrong key. Especially likely as the index finger has just struck N.    >[JA]  不動明王様の庭に集う乙女たちが  >[ES] Las señoritas que se reúnen en el jardín la estatua del guerrero Budista,  While the English translation used the term ""wisdom king"" (the title of Acala) and the German and French parroted it blindly, Spanish translation seems to have been made separately and translates it to a ""Buddhist warrior"". Did the translator attempt to do some research and saw that Acala is often portrayed with a sword?  ---  ##Conclusion:  From what I've seen, I guess what happened was this:  * English translation was most likely done in Japan in a hurry by a native Japanese speaker.  * French and German translations were based on the English translation. Also in a hurry.  * Spanish translation was most likely independent. At a first glance it looks much better than the English one.  * **There were most likely no editors involved.**  * All egregious mistakes were due to a human, mostly the English translator, but most importantly, even more **due to the managers** who didn't care about the quality of the final product.  ---  Of course , one might ask, what a bad MTL translation looks like, so you know what to look for. Here are some examples from the episode:  (EDIT: Or just see what The Yuzuki Family’s Four Sons originally looked like:  )  >[JA] 不動明王様の庭に集う乙女たちが、今日も新撰組大使のような無垢な笑顔で、玉川の流れを超えていく。  >[Google] The young girls who gather in the garden of Acala Buddha statue today too are **sailing** across the Tamagawa River with innocent smiles like Shinsengumi ambassadors.  Correct punctuation, correct capitalization, no typos, proper names preserved, but Google chose a nonsensical word in this context: ""sailing"".  (EDIT: the example above keeps my mistake of using 大使 ""ambassador"" instead of its homophone 隊士 ""trooper"", for some reason, according to Google troopers no longer sail, but what's important is that Google _may_ use the word ""sail"" for no reason.)  >[JA] 私は鹿部の所有の鹿になるわけだから。  >[Google] After all, I will become a deer owned by the Shikabu.  >[DeepL] So I would be a deer owned by the deer department.  Google fails to understand what a deer club is. Official subs use the correct term ""deer club"" and even capitalize it from time to time.  >[JA] 分かったよヤンキーのお姉さん。  >[Google] I get it, Yankee lady.  >[DeepL] All right, Yankee sister.  Both tools misunderstand slang.  So as you can see, the types of mistakes are different. Other types of mistakes I often see with machine-translated Japanese are:  * translating proper names  * guessing incorrect readings for names  * confusing who speaks to whom  * confusing genders  * misunderstood puns and references  * confusion with hiragana-heavy text  They may also happen with human translators, but much less often.",anime,1dy6mi6

Nothing against Demon Slayer, but its not exactly his demographic.  I'm decently versed in Anime and from what I've seen Monster basically stands alone. Mushishi is the only thing I've thought of that he might also enjoy, very different show but has the same sort of maturity to it.

Their summaries can be found in [this comment](/comments/ceu2ns/_/eu63rs8) and [this comment](/comments/ceu2ns/_/eubbvk9). - The English Wikipedia page on the attack has a good collection of information, but we won't link it here as it also mentions the name of the suspect.  &nbsp;  ## Donations/Support  [**Kyoto Animation has opened a bank accout for receiving donations**]( Donated money will go to the families and relatives of deceased employees; the recuperating employees and their families and relatives; and reconstruction of the company. The amount of received donations will be reported by Kyoto Animation for the sake of transparancy, and fundraising activities that are carried out in support of the company will be listed on their site once they have been verified by them.  [Via @daysofcolor:]( VERY IMPORTANT FYI: For those of you using American banks to send funds to KyoAni, when filling out the form at your bank, put the branch number AND account number in the “account number” field before sending or the money might go missing!   [See the linked tweet for more information]  &nbsp;  RightStuf has set up [a donation page]( through the end of August for those that want to avoid fees for smaller donation amounts.  Sentai Filmworks had set up [a GoFundMe page]( (**now ended**) to benefit KyoAni. [More info about how the transfer of funds will occur.](  Others have also been talking about buying digital goods from [KyoAni's online shop]( as this money goes directly to KyoAni and there is minimal effort required of the staff to process these payments. [A guide to doing so has been made.](  In Japan, many companies and locations will also collect donations for the studio and the affected, including [retail chain Animate]( [Uji City at Sightseeing Center 1]( and the [Kyoto International Manga Museum](  Crunchyroll has also released a statement and created a form for those who wish to share messages with KyoAni. [It can be found here.](  ~~Additionally, the mod team is trying to organize a tribute to KyoAni in the form of fanart and well-wishes. This will occur on the 14th of August, with submissions closing on the 10th. Please post any tributes in the thread [here]( If your tributes are text based please submit them via the google form [here]( instead.~~  &nbsp;  ## Relevant Industry Tributes  * [Aki Toyosaki (Yui from K-On!) speaking on the incident and her time at KyoAni]( in her radio show Okaeri Radio / Welcome Home Radio * [P.A. Works president Kenji Horikawa held a speech at the company concerning his thoughts on the incident]( (translated by /u/yuiyahallo) * [Xinhua News Agency caught former KyoAni director Yutaka Yamamoto praying near the destroyed building]( * Many other figures in the industry have also responded, /u/mika6000 has collected [these responses in this comment](  &nbsp;  ## Moderation notes  People making poor-taste jokes, calls to violence, and other inappropriate comments will be removed, and extreme cases will get bans. This will be a heavily moderated thread, and we likely won't be using removal reasons to avoid causing meta drama.  **Any identification of the suspect in any way will not be tolerated.**  We don't normally make stickies for news events like this, but because of how extreme the current situation is, the mod team has decided to make an exception and gather information about the unfolding situation in one place. Existing threads on the matter will stay up, but we're asking further updates be posted here rather than in separate threads.  [Send a modmail](/message/compose?to=/r/anime) or ping your favorite moderator to have a news link added to this thread or for amendments to the situation summary.",anime,ceu2ns

"My Thoughts on Gundam Build Fighters I finally made it to the first Gundam anime i ever watched 12 years go.  Now that I'm done crying at that sad realization, yeah, this is where I started many years ago.  I'm not sure why I started with a series that was meant as an anniversary story for the Gundam franchise, but I'm glad I did because I loved it, and I'm glad to reveal that it holds up all these years later.  It's no masterpiece, but it's still extremely enjoyable and entertaining.  The general plot is simple; it takes place in our world, where the characters build plastic model sets of mobile suits, which is an actual thing in our world, and they use them in these kind of virtual reality simulations.        It felt very similar to Yu-Gi-Oh, Bakugan:  Battle Brawlers, and Beyblade, which are three anime that I grew up with.  I think that's the reason I loved it so much back then even though I hadn't seen a single Gundam installment yet at that point.  And I can confidently say that if you like those other anime I mentioned above you'll like this even if you haven't seen any other Gundam series.  But if you are a fan of Gundam, then you should also enjoy this.  It manages to simultaneously successfully appeal to hardcore Gundam enthusiasts, model kit builders, (from what I've heard, because I am not in that group myself), and fans of this aforementioned ""type"" of anime.        The characters are a ton of fun.  The most famous one is Rinko Iori, for obvious reasons.  It seems like her popularity has transcended the anime itself, and it's not hard to understand why.  She's attractive, she's cute, she's likeable, and she's super supportive of her son's hobby, and is also pretty funny too.  She's literally the perfect waifu so it's not surprising that everybody fell in love with her.  But there's an endless stream of entertainment that nearly every character provides.  Sei is adorable, but also perfectly represents how a lot of super nerdy people are when they really get to talking about what they're passionate about, and Reiji was an absolute blast.  Most of the laughs I got out of this series were because of him.  Although I wish we learned more about the other world that he was originally from, though.        I just felt happy watching it.  It's not as serious as your typical Gundam anime, but it's not as cartoony and childish as either of the SD Gundam installments, it rests comfortable in between those tonally.        Since I've spent almost a month going through Gundam from the very beginning, it was nice seeing a bunch of the mobile suits which were modeled directly after mobile suits that were see in previously Gundam series', which is something I wouldn't have noticed the first time I watched it.  I should also mention that even though the main focus of this series isn't the Gundam battles, it's the slice of life comedy element with the Gundam battles in the virtual simulation constructed around it, these are actually some of the best action sequences in the series yet, despite how short most of the battles actually are.",anime,1kon72p

P.S. animals dont need to be anthropomorphic but they at least need to talk like humans. Any suggestions? TYSM!",anime,1koi9no
"What should I watch from my planning list? Here's my [anilist profile]( to help get a sense of my taste and what I plan to watch, ill also try and sum it up.  I like a little of everything, and I typically alternate between romance/slice of life/wholesome and action/battle/violent just to keep things interesting and different. I just finished Your Lie In April (peak btw) so I'd typically go for something aggressive next, but don't limit suggestions to just that. Any suggestions based on this info would be awesome, and I'm happy to answer any additional questions to narrow it down. Recommendations to add to the list are also welcome. Also feel free to debate me on my taste, however keep in mind that my list is very skewed because of the order I watched things in.",anime,1kol2vc

"Any Anime Where the MC Gets Set Up/Manipulated Something like this is what im looking for: The MC’s very happy and excited after getting asked out, thinking things are finally turning around. But when he arrives the following day it turns out to be nothing but a brutal setup. He shows up expecting a fun date with a beautiful girl, only to be betrayed and attacked. They saw him as the enemy all along and used the date to lure him in.   Yeah something like that i'd say fits what im looking for. Or maybe the MC kind of just get manipulated and accidentally follows along with the enemy's plan without knowing anything about it.   Not required to be brutal or a revenge story, neither does the anime have to revolve around betrayal, it doesn't have to be anything too crazy. It doesnt even have to happen in the first 5 episodes or very early in the series, if theres an arc in the series that revolves around the MC getting set up that starts late at like episode 30 or something, im all for it.",anime,1koj4xh
"Look for disturbing anime. > I’m trying to remember an anime with a really disturbing standalone-style episode.  It focused on a group of girls who were captured by bandits and sold nightly as sex workers to nobles.  There was a scene where they were putting on makeup to prepare for the night. One girl mutilated her face (I think to avoid being chosen), and I remember scissors being involved. Another girl may have tried to commit suicide.  They were saved at the end.   Afterward, I think the rescued girls ended up working for MC in a store or business.  I don't remember anything else and it's driving me nuts.   Any ideas?",anime,1kora4g

"Just getting around to watching Moonrise.. Currently on episode 16 and just thinking...  The show in general is really really good. Honestly I hope Netflix paid them a huge bag for this kind of quality and effort.  I'm imagining, if this was a series that aired weekly during the season instead of all the episodes just quietly dropped on Netflix, I would have heard much more about it.  I am assuming the show has still done well, I'm just disappointed they chose to drop all the episodes at once, instead of giving it the treatment of some other Netflix series recently.  EDIT : Holy hell ya'll hated it LMAO. This show is nowhere near my favorites and top whatever. I also have my gripes with bits and pieces of the show, script, VAs, etc. BUT as I watch and me when writing this...I know crazy detailed art & animation when I see it in the sense of time put into it. Obv that doesn't account for what makes a show/story good or not and I know it's ONA, so not televised. But I remember some animes like Bluebox, Ranma, Orb being released by week. Maybe there is a difference between the Netflix licensing there that I'm just not aware of. I don't mind binge watching all at once, but was just thinking releasing slowly could maybe save it when it comes to people giving the show a chance. But yeah, I was mainly speaking on hoping Netflix paid them properly cuz I'd still imagine a shit ton of work went into that show. Like even if people consider the script shit, that shouldn't be a reason why the other workers on the anime shouldn't get paid for their efforts lol. And specifically it being on Netflix, I almost skipped over it. Then again, personally I still consider this show better than a lot of stuff being released right now, so maybe I was just giving it some easy props. Now ya'll are gonna make me finish this show with my most judgmental eyes..was trying to continue on with this all innocent LOL.",anime,1koioj3

"Where can I watch One Piece legally/illegally from Episode 1 in India? Hey fellow One Piece fans,  I've been wanting to start One Piece from the very beginning, but I'm having trouble finding a platform in India that streams all the episodes legally.  Here’s what I’ve checked so far:  Crunchyroll: Starts from around Episode 892 and streams new episodes weekly, but the earlier arcs (Episode 1 onwards) are missing.  Netflix India: Has a limited set of episodes, and sadly, the earliest ones aren’t there.  Cartoon Network India: Recently started airing the anime from Season 1 in Hindi and other regional languages, but it’s on a fixed broadcast schedule, and I prefer on-demand.  Amazon Prime Video India: Seems to have a few episodes, but not the full series—and it's unclear how much is accessible.

"Is Frieren the best Fantasy Anime of all time? I’m really curious to what you all think.   I heavily prefer Fantasy, Action, Isekai, Shounen, Magic anime. I’ve nearly watched every single one that’s been released in the last 10 years. From Ixion Saga DT, to Isekai Cheat Magician, and more. I enjoy & watch all the seasonal fantasy/isekai “trash” that comes by.   While anime like Grimgar, Overlord, Slime Tensei, Moshoku Tensei, Re Zero, FMAB, and many more are all favorites of mine - I’m not sure if they even come close to the Masterpiece Frieren is. The entire 28 episodes. The OST, the OP, the Character Designs, the Depth, the Animation Techniques, the Story…… All of it.   It’s almost too good. I feel bad for people who were introduced to anime with this one. While I grew up watching Naruto, (and have since rewatched 3-4x) some people had to witness this early on in their anime watching journey. After watching Frieren, very few can even come close - especially when we’re talking about Fantasy. I’m just absolutely blown away. I’m not sure if Frieren is my favorite; I still think Re Zero holds that spot for me, but Frieren is definitely the best fantasy anime I’ve ever watched. Without question. I give it a perfect 10/10.",anime,1komk2f

"Arknights Prelude to Dawn & Perish in Frost Rewatch Interest Thread With the upcoming third Season (Rise from Ember) airing in July, it's time to rewatch the previous two seasons of Arknights. Or watch them for the first time if you haven't already.  # What is Arknights?  Arknights is a tower defense gacha game developed by Chinese game company Hypergryph and published globally by Yostar. The player takes the role of the ""Doctor"" who lost all of his memories before the start of the game. The synopsis of Prelude to Dawn gives a good spoiler-free glimpse into the world of Arknights:  >In the land of Terra, natural disasters of unknown causes have been occurring irregularly in many areas. Therefore, the majority of the people, in order to escape those natural disasters, came to live in mobile cities developed over the years. The Originium left behind at the site of such Catastrophes, has led to the rapid progress of civilization due to their immense energy. But it also brought something else with it — an incurable disease called Oripathy.  >Because the bodies of those with Oripathy gradually crystalize and become a new source of infection at the time of death, in many countries, the Infected are subject to persecution under regimes of segregation and forced labor. Those who were oppressed by the governments are starting to rebel. Rhodes Island, a pharmaceutical company researching a cure for Oripathy, takes up their arms and starts a conquest trying to save all the people from the disease.  If you want a first look at the show, I would recommend watching the four trailers released for the first season of the anime and the first animation PV of the game. Also please stay away from all Concept Trailer after the second one as they contain major spoilers.  First animated game PV: [  Prelude to Dawn PVs: [1]( [2]( [3]( [4](  # Why should I watch it?  While most gacha adaptations struggle to find a good way to adapt their stories, Arknights has the big advantage that the Doctor isn't just an empty shell but rather a full-fledged character shrouded in mystery. The adaptation starts at the beginning of the game with no prior knowledge needed to watch the series. Production wise the whole show was produced in a 2.35:1 format and with 5.1 surround sound to achieve a more cinematic and high-quality feeling than normal TV anime. Although the first season still shows that Yostar Pictures is a pretty new animation studio, season 2 especially shows the potential of the studio.  # Where to watch?  Both seasons are on [Crunchyroll]( but personally I would recommend watching the Blu-ray version of the show. Why you ask? CR doesn’t have the 5.1 surround sound the show aired with on Japanese TV and the last episode of season 1 has broken audio too.  # Cast  Amiya: Tomoyo Kurosawa  Doctor: Yuki Kaida  Ch'en: Shizuka Ishigami  Kal'tsit: Youko Hikasa  Talulah: Maaya Sakamoto  and many more...  # Staff  Director/Sound Director: Yuuki Watanabe  Assistant Director: Masaki Nishikawa, Shintarou Douge (S2 only)  Character Design: Aya Takafuji  Art Director: Minoru Oonishi  Music: Yuuki Hayashi  Animation Production: Yostar Pictures  Opening Theme: ReoNa (S1), MYTH & ROID (S2)  Ending Theme: Doul (S1), ReoNa (S2)  # More Info  Prelude to Dawn: [MAL]( | [Anilist]( | [Anidb]( | [ANN](  Perish in Frost: [MAL]( | [Anilist]( | [Anidb]( | [ANN](  # Schedule  My current plan would be to start on June 9th with episode 1 and end on June 27th with the series discussion, a week before the third season, Rise from Ember, starts. That would be one episode per day (16 episodes in total) with a season discussion and a one-day break after episode 8. For the specific time I would say 22:00 CET/13:00 PST/16:00 EST plus/minus one hour depending on opinions under this post.  # Spoilers  Spoilers should obviously be marked as such given that Arknights features some very complex world building and lore that could spoil every current and future season of the anime. Given the recent big lore drop (Chapter 15) on the CN servers I would also appreciate it if spoilers specific to the CN version of the game are treated with extra caution and get marked explicitly. For all people that can't follow that rule: I hope the gacha gods will punish you on the next (limited) banner.  # A last thing  Since this is my first time hosting a rewatch, I appreciate every bit of feedback for this hastily thrown together rewatch. I wasn't really expecting Rise from Ember in the Summer season. If you have anything, please let me know. In addition to questions of the day, I'm planning to do a daily production background. If this thread gets sufficient comments/interest till the middle of next week, I will continue with the plan.",anime,1kouxpp

"Need top 10 recommendations over the past 25 years! I was too into anime at the turn of the century.  When the only way to watch was either Toonami, buy what limited DVDs or torrent/IRC fansubs.

"My Thoughts on Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Freedom It was a pleasant surprise to learn that Mobile Suit Gundam Seed had another installment, and it came out recently, in 2024.  It was exciting because Gundam Seed is my favorite series so far, even though the original anime is the only part of Seed i actually liked.  And even though this is just a movie, it's pretty damn good.  Since it is a movie there's obviously a limit as to what it can accomplish given the short amount of time, but it uses the time it has expertly to give a movie that was fun, interesting, and emotionally enthralling, almost as much as the first season of Mobile Suit Gundam Seed.    First of all, the visuals and sound are obviously vastly superior to any previous Seed installment, not only because it's a movie and thus has a higher budget, but also because it came out 18 years after the previous installment, or 19 years after the last full season, not including the ONA.  The art is modern, the animation is incredible, and the mecha fights are super fun.  It's exactly as I would imagine the original Seed would be if it came out today, which is great.    As for the characters, they're also good.  The main characters of the movie are returning characters, Lacus Clyne, whom I didn't care about much at all in the old Gundam Seed series, and Kira Yamato, whom I've always had mixed feelings about but I stated I didn't like the direction of his character at all in Seed Destiny, but they're handled pretty well here.  Some might say that the themes, and especially the execution of such, are cheesy, but I think they're fine.  The themes themselves aren't cheesy in my opinion, they're very real, although I couldn't argue if you thought the over the top execution of the themes are, but that's one of the things I love about anime, especially from the early 2000s era of anime; while this movie is recent, this story came from that era.    The main conflict in this movie has to do with Coordinators vs. Naturals, Coordinators being genetically enhanced humans and Naturals being normal humans.  The main villains are Coordinators who believe they're the natural evolution of humanity and are destined to replace them.  One of the antagonists is also a man who is in love with Lacus and wants to marry her.  He claims this is because it's their destiny to rule the world together since they're both Coordinators, but we get hints that the real reason is more selfish.  We get the idea that he doesn't understand what love is, that someone has to have something, some kind of skill or qualification, that makes them worthy of being loved by certain people.  But Lacus loves Kira, and nothing would ever change that.    There's another antagonist, a female one, and while it's never directly stated, I believe they were trying to hint that this woman was secretly in love with the main male villain.  I think we have evidence of this, such as how she got extra pissed at Lacus, possibly showing that she not only hated her because the man she loved was in love with her, but also hated that she wasn't willing to try and make him happy.  And it seems like the male antagonist realized this by the end, and despite everything they did it was really sad when they both died in each others arms.",anime,1kk92tq

When I was a teen, I loved a lot of things and was generally more open to give things more of a chance. Now, I find myself really having trouble getting into shows and rotating between my shows I watched when I was younger:   Death note (excellent story, villains, and characters 11/10)  Sk8 the infinity (excellent story, characters, action, villain, and vibes over all...comfort anime 12/10)  Ouran Host Club (It's silly, goofy, has the feels, first ever anime I watched...10/10)  Frieren (10/10 omg such a great show, I loved it. It was a bit anticlimactic at places but I wasn't watching it for the action.)  Kimetsu no Yaiba (9/10, great show distinct characters, fairly streamlined plot. Love)  Attack on titan (9/10 great characters as well, very much a masterpiece)  Violet Evergarden (what a beautiful and compelling show, some of the characters seemed a bit flat but I love this show 9/10)  Tower of God (7/10 not the best animation but, I like it because I read the manga).  Tokyo revengers (7/10 I like the characters and the overall vibes of the show. Wish the fight scenes were better but I am into the plot.)  Solo Leveling (6/10 here's why. Jinwoo to me lost a lot of his intrigue as he leveled up, he lost much of his personality. However the hook at the beginning of the show was really good and I love seeing his shadow army and the challenges he is faced with).   I did watch Jujustu Kaisen, to be honest I never really got into it. Same with Tokyo Ghoul.   TLDR; I suppose what I am looking for in shows are deep, meaningful characters. Bonus points for  complicated villains included. I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to both characters and episodes. Though I am willing to watch longer shows (nothing like 1000 episodes though), I would prefer smaller length ones! I also like when there is a good hook at the beginning.

"My Thoughts on Superior Defender Gundam Force I wanna try and be nice with this one, but it's really bad.  Apparently a lot of millennials and gen z have memories growing up with it and loved it as kids.  I have no memories of this whatsoever.  If I watched it when I was like 5 years old or I could have definitely seen myself liking it, but I don't think I'd tolerate this at any older unless there was literally nothing fun to watch or do.  It definitely has no value to me as a grown man at almost 31 other than a strange curiosity, and also trying to complete every Gundam installment.  It's very unique I'll give it that, but this anime is a prime example of the fact that just because something is original doesn't necessarily make it good.      The visuals are terrible.  It's not just because it's CGI, although that would inherently check points against it until proven otherwise, but it just looks cheap, and even laggy at times.  The action was bad, the soundtrack was mid, the voice acting wasn't great.  There's just nothing here for me.

"[Review] Sword Art Online II (Calibur & Mother Rosario): Friendship is magic The last arc was pretty dark. Not overly grim, but covered stuff you wouldn't expect. Of course, some people would want some time to cool down, see our characters catch a breather. And for the most part, I enjoyed it. I'm just not over the moon about these 2 arcs. I mentioned before that I've never been a fan of these 2 arcs. I don't dislike them per SE, I'm just ambivalent towards these 2. I'll brush through Caliber and then give my full thoughts on Mother Rosario.   Calibur: I honestly don't really have too much to say, as it's just the group doing a side quest. Nothing too special, I can just speed run this review.  \- Plot:  The year is coming to an end and the gang wants to end it off with a bang. So they take on a side quest to obtain the legendary Excalibur. But it turns out that there’s more to this side quest. That’s honestly all you need to know. It is just the SAO group spending time in the game. Not necessarily bad, there’s not really a whole lot to analyze. As I mentioned, it’s not as deep as the rest of the other arcs and it really doesn’t cover anything complex. Again not bad, just much to say.  \- Characters:  All you need to know is that Agil unfortunately doesn’t take part in it. The man has a business to run. Otherwise, the group’s personalities here are pretty simplistic compared to the previous arc. Hell, I’ll just run them through; Kirito is man who knows what he’s doing while teasing his team at times, Asuna is there for moral support, Leafa is friends with an elephant squid, Sinon uses a bow and teases Kirito back, Liz…… does stuff, Silica is the neko Cat Sith, Yui is in the back drinking her apple juice, and Klein is the comedic relief (I may have missed some stuff). I think what carries these guys is the banter they have with each other. They feel like actual friends and have some fun quips here & there. Their suit up scene is corny, but I can’t hate it. I won’t talk about the quest givers, Freyja, or the Ice Giant, as they’re just NPCs. All I’m gonna say is that Kirito & gang weren’t joking when they called Freyja “a trap”.  \- World Building:  We’re back at it Alfheim, and along with it, some nifty new lore. I didn’t talk about it in my review on Phantom Bullet, but Alfheim now has some nifty changes. Outside of being about to fly indefinitely, we get to see some new skills. Melee weapons have elemental attacks, you can use bow & arrows, and there’s katana skills. There’s also a loophole called skill connect, where Kirito can swap a weapon’s effect from sword to another. However, what I don’t get is why they didn’t have Dual Wielding skills in the first place? Like, you can dual wield in the game, why can’t you add a skill for it? As for the side quest, from my understanding it’s basically a Norse myth where the gang must pull the sword of Excalibur to stop the Elephant squids from becoming extinct. I barely know world history, so don’t bother asking me if that’s accurate. Not much to add in terms of lore. Now let's talk about the ending.  \- Ending:  The ending is simple & sweet. The gang fights the boss, gets Excalibur, saves the elephant squids, and then celebrates at Agil’s. A few things to talk about though. 1.) When Kirito nearly lost the Excalibur, Sinon saved it at the last minute and gave it to him. Under one condition, if he thinks of her every time he draws it. Like….WHAT?!?! This kinda goes a little above friends, don’t you think? Asuna is DEFINITELY having a word with those 2 later. 2.) Kirito is now working on this special camera that allows Yui to interact with the real world. That’s going to be important later in the series. And 3.) He’s basically blowing his check from the last arc on dinner with his friend.  I can only imagine what he could’ve done with that money  \- Vertic:  As you can tell, I don’t have too much to say about this arc as I do with the previous arcs or will the later arcs. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing, as Calibur does exactly what it seeks out to do, be a simplistic arc of the gang just hanging out. And it does that pretty well. I mentioned this before, but there seems to be a negative view toward “short anime”, just because it isn’t long enough. I personally find some enjoyment in shorter shows if they use the time they’re given appropriately. There’s a reason why I enjoyed Breaker Battlelog more than most people. And while I don’t have the same feelings towards this as I do with Breaker, but I still managed to enjoy myself with Calibur. Overall, a cute lil filler. Now let's talk about AIDS  Mother Rosario: This is a well beloved arc among SAO fans. It lets Asuna be the main focus for a change, it introduces a beloved character to the fold, it tackles pretty relatable themes that can be applied to some, and it's an arc ... .that I don’t feel the same as everyone else. NGL, this is where the series starts to show the cracks a little. While I still think this is a really good arc, I never really liked it as much as everyone else. While there is enough to consider it decent, there’s also enough holding it back for me. This is going to be a tough review, because if I’m too critical, then it comes off as unsympathetic and mean. But if I’m too positive, it comes off as fake and dishonest. So I might as well be honest while being considerate. If you're a massive fan of this arc, I don’t think this is the post for you and I apologize in advance  \- Plot:  With a player making a name for herself for how much she's mowing down the competition. Asuna decides to take a swing after learning that not even Kirito would have beat her. However, after the match, it turns out the player was actually scouting for players to join her in a boss raid alongside her small guild. This leads to her learning about the player, and even learning a little bit about how she can deal with her real life problems. So out of all the arcs, this is probably the most grounded & normal of the bunch. No death game, no stakes, just Asuna making some new friends. Which is honestly not that bad. Again, it's okay to take a breather after such a dark arc. However, that was the schtick of the last arc, and that was 3-episodes. This arc takes the lion-share of 7-episodes. Which is a little too long IMO. I enjoyed the last few episodes fine enough, but those first 4-episodes were a slog. I'll get into more detail later on, but just know I was 50/50 on what this arc was going for. So I got the story out of the way, let's get to the real meat of these reviews  \- Characters:  This is the Asuna arc and that’s the selling point. Before I talk about what she goes through in this arc I might as well give my brief opinion on Asuna in general. To put it simply, I view her as “The Fiona” of the series’s Shrek. It’s not that I have a negative opinion on her, it’s just that she is the character I can relate to the least. I dunno, I just never been a fan of the rich girl stereotype (there’s a reason why I don’t like Miorine from Witch from Mercury. Catelynn from Arcane is the GOAT tho). However, unlike that white haired Karen, I can at least say this is where she is the strongest in terms of characterization. She has a pretty good arc where she learns to fight to get her point across. It also helps that we get to see her strong leadership skills in the arc. We’ve gotten some hints of that in the 1st arc (though not in a positive light), but now we get to see her put those skills to good use. However, there’s someone in the way of her through desires. And that’s her mother, Kyouko Yuuki. In some sense, she serves as the antagonist of the arc. While she’s not a villain, she’s still pretty malicious with her treatment towards her own daughter. Not in an abusive way per se, but more so on how she brudens hers with the amount of expectations of their family status. She tries to set her up with some rich kids, has Kirito investigated while calling him “unworthy”, and forces her to change schools. She’s a social climber through & through, and tries to drag her daughter with her. What’s worse, there are parents like that IRL. Parents who force expectations upon their children & chastise them for the most minor flaw. Luckily she does mellow out and give her daughter the freedom she deserves.  Now let's talk about the most beloved character in the series, Yuuki Konno. And this is gonna offend some people, but I don’t think she’s as good as people make her out to be. Lower your pitchforks folks, I still think she’s a good character in her own right. I just think people kinda overhype her a little. She’s really cheerful, spunky, and can hold her own in a fight. All of which is elevated by Erica Mendez’s performance. Plus her banter with Asuna was pretty neat, though short lived. And that's where my problems begin, as…she only interacts with Asuna. Outside of her, 2 of her friends, and a doctor, she doesn't really interact with anyone else. Character interaction with the cast plays a major role on what opinion I have on a character, and Yuuki kinda lacks that as she barely interacts with anyone else. Some of you may go “well, the arc is only 7 episodes, how can you get her to interact with the rest of the characters”? And I mean… it's not that hard to do. You mean to tell me that you couldn't get her to interact with other people within 7 episodes. Kamina from Gurren Lagann was in the show for 8 episodes, that's not far off from 7, and he managed to have a good relationship with the vast majority of the cast; He’s Simon’s surrogate brother, has the hots for Yoko, friendly rivals with Kittan, enemies with Viral, makes fun of Rosio, and hates authority figures like both chiefs. It wasn't with everyone in the series, but it was enough people to make his death hit harder. And while Yuuki's death was sad (which I'll talk about later), it doesn't hit as hard as we barely knew her relationship with everyone else. I also don't really like her plan, but I'll talk about that later.  Now let's get to the Sleeping Knights, Yuuki's group of discord friends. And calling them characters….. well… let's just say that's a little dishonest. Only 2 of them actually have some involvement in the story. Well… only Siune really. She has a little more to do as she tells Asuna about the Sleeping Knights and talks to her at the end of the arc. Jun doesn't really have much plot relevance, but still has some more lines compared to the rest. I barely remember anything about the rest of them; Talken is shy four-eyed Sylph, Nori is the spunky Springen, and Tecchi is the silent tank. They barely have any lines of dialogue and can be removed from the arc & nothing would really change. Hell, the later arcs don't even include them, which makes their inclusion all the more superfluous. The only reason they're here is because we need an excuse to have a guild. And at that point, just have the rest of the old crew, where you can have them interact with the new characters in unique & meaningful ways. But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Now let's talk about the last of the new characters, Doctor Kurahashi. While only being in 2 episodes, he's a pretty chill doctor who cares about Yuuki and really shows us the full capability of Full Dive tech for medical applications. He's also voiced by Robbie Daymond, and he does a pretty good job in this role (side note: I find it ironic that this role cares about the sickly, while his role in Iron Blooded Orphans as Gaelio Baudin ... .is the opposite to put it lightly).  Now with all the new characters out of the way, let's talk about the returning ones. Lisbeth & Silica don't do much as usual, but Klein does help Kirito buy time for the Sleeping Knights boss raid. Sinon does appear, but only briefly since the LN came before Phantom Bullet while the anime has PB 1st & MR later. Agil gets expanded a little more, as we learn about how he got trapped in SAO to begin with, as it was a bet with his wife. I really like that, as it adds a little more depth to him. And then there's my boi Kirito. While he isn't the focus, he still plays a major role in the story. He learns about Yuuki's condition and uses his skills in the real world to help her. He also has a really badass moment where he stalls for time to allow the Sleeping Knights to fight the Boss. Even though he isn't the focus, he still plays an integral role in the story and the arc wouldn’t be the same without him. Too bad the majority of the anime community still think the series doesn’t need him, which is a statement that genuinely grinds my gears, right next to “the best mecha is without mecha” and “anime is better than cartoons”. I’ll do more of a rant of that dumb statement once I get to War of Underworld, just know that there’s a lot of stuff in this arc that wouldn’t happen without Kirito. The Sleeping Knights wouldn’t have gotten to the boss, Asuna wouldn’t have found Yuuki, and Yuuki herself wouldn’t have been able to interact with the real world. You may dislike him all you want with your media illiteracy, but you can’t deny that he’s an integral part of the franchise.  Overall, while not all the characters were my cup of tea, I didn’t dislike any of them (except Kyouko). Not all of them had a lot of screen time, but the ones who did definitely left an impression. Asuna got the attention she deserved and expanded on her in interesting ways. And while I don’t love Yuuki as much as the rest of the fandom, I can definitely see why she’s a fan favorite.   \- World Building:  While we’re still in the world of Alfheim, there’s some new additions to the lore. For one, we actually see a little bit of New Aincrad. We especially got to see that cabin again, which was a really heartwarming scene. And then we learn that you can make some custom moves in the game (I kinda wished we saw some other skills, but that’s just me). We also get to see some new races of fairies; like the Undine, Imps, Leprechaun, and Gnome. Not all of them were expanded upon like the Sylphs or the Salmons, but it’s something. Otherwise, it’s business as usual.  However, I have a hot take, I thought the whole boss raid plot was kinda dumb. For one, I thought Yuuki's plan to recruit people was weird. Like, Asuna didn't even win the fight, and she was recruited. Which makes me ask, what if a player ACTUALLY beat her? Would they still be worthy to join the raid? I just don't like the cliche where someone fights someone for seemingly no reason and then it turns out to be a ploy to see if they're strong enough. Because there are better ways to test someone's strength. The only time this cliche was done right was in Avatar the Last Airbender & Power Rangers Dino Thunder. I also didn't really care about the boss raid in general. From my understanding, the reason why the Sleeping Knights want to beat the boss with a small group is because they want to get their names on the leaderboard so they can be remembered. And while I can understand why with the context of their background, it doesn't help that I don't really care about half of them. Again, if half of them were replaced with the old crew, the arc won't change that much.  I know I've been negative about the arc, it's just that it has my least favorite aspects of SAO. There's still stuff I really like. I think the stuff involving the real world is really interesting. For one, I like how we learn more about Asuna’s life outside of VR. It's a good juxtaposition between her & Kirito. While we see the guy having a traditional Japanese home, Asuna lives in a more fancy mansion. It highlights how their environments influenced them as people, as while Kirito was raised by a humble family, Asuna is raised by a family that only cares about her being successful. It also gets more interesting when we get to see how much VR has advanced. But before we get to that, I guess I should talk about Yuuki’s condition. The kid has AIDS, and the show doesn’t sugarcoat it. The basic gist of it is that her mom got a blood transplant with inflected blooded and that basically killed everyone in the family. So that left Yuuki in an immovable state, leaving her in VR for over 3 years. Which leads to a nifty new piece tech called, the Medicuboid. This is basically a more advanced VR that allows ill patients to Full-Dive. This really highlights the vast potential of VR that Kayaba wanted. And I love that Kirito manages to make a rig to allow Yuuki to interact with the real world, when she gets to go to school again & see her old house again. All of this really encompasses the main theme of SAO, showing us the possibilities of VR, and after seeing it used for malicious purposes for 2 arcs, it’s a breath of free air for this series.  Overall, I think the strongest aspect of this arc is the stuff in the real world. I like learning more about Asuna’s life offline . I was just not vibing with the VR stuff, which is very rare for me in SAO. But again, that’s just me. Otherwise, I don’t really have too much to say.  \- Ending:  This is the moment where everyone busts out the tissue box and cries out in a river. However,...... I’m not one of those people. Before I give my reasoning on why I deserve to be crucified by the ZZ fans, I might as well explain what happens. In the last episode, after Asuna convinces her mom that hating video games is suss & to let her stay in school, everyone has a carne asada in Alfheim (I’m Latino). They fight a boss, race in the sky, have a duel, and the girls go on a trip somewhere (all of this is in a span of 2 minutes). And then she gets the news that Yuuki is about to die and she and the gang spend her last few moments together in Alfheim. The scene itself is pretty sweet, as it’s Yuuki spending her final moments giving Asuna the skill Mother Rosario and laying by the woman she saw as a sister. It’s a really sad scene, yet my eyes remained dry as Nevada. Why, you may ask? Am I just bitter? Yes, but that’s not really it. For starters, the opening of the episode feels really rushed as it’s group in a BBQ, and then there’s a sky race, and then a duel between Kirito & Yuuki (that probably made the dumb Kirito haters blush), and then there’s a trip to Kyoto. Like, THERE’S TOO MUCH HAPPENING IN A SPAN 2 MINUTES. And then everyone in the game comes to Yuuki’s final moments, and I mean EVERYONE. Which feels a little frivolous, as she already has the people who actually matter to her around her. I feel like the scene would've been more impactful if it just had Asuna, the Sleepy Knights, and the old SAO gang. I can only imagine the players who didn’t show up feel shitty after not appearing for the death of a child they barely knew. It just takes me out of the moment and it just shows that this episode should’ve been 2 episodes, that way we can see Yuuki ACTUALLY interacting with everyone else and make this death feel more impactful. And the final moments of the episode is as Yuuki’s funeral with Asuna, surprisingly taking it well.  Look, I didn’t want to sound like an ass, but it’s just stuff I just find hard to overlook. However, still stuff I like about this scene. For starters, the acting is strong as hell here. Cherami Leigh did the recording after her grandmother died, and you can tell she put that emotion in this scene. The little talk with Sinue at the funeral was really sweet, and gave us a glimmer of hope. I also love the epilogue with the gang hanging out at the park, having a lil picnic. That’s adorable.  \- Verdict:  Mother Rosario is an arc I’m not fond of, but I can see why people love it. It expands on a beloved character and adds a new one to be loved by all. I just wished they went about it differently. You're probably wondering why my opinion on this arc is vastly different from other SAO fans. Do I just have tastes that belong with 3 pretentious AniTubers on a podcast? I dunno, but what I do know is that the fandom kinda overhyped this a little. Look I get it, it’s a sweet story that people relate to. Maybe you had a family member or friend who had a similar sickness and has passed away or are still dealing with it. But my issues come in when you compare it to both the previous arcs & the later ones, where the themes are deeper and the characters are better utilized. I heard some people say Fairy Dance is better, and while that’s an extreme take, I don’t *dis*agree. Because at least the tone in that arc is consistent with the one that came before it. But here, it starts off as a fun little boss raid and then ends with Violet Evergarden at home. Some people are into that, but I’m just not one of those people.   Before I end this review, I just want to remind people to not take these reviews super seriously (if you read them, since lilitarcy is low and people don’t like to read). These are just my personal opinions, and it sure as hell isn’t gospel. People will have different opinions on things no matter what fandom your part off. If you didn’t know, I’m a Gundam fan and there’s a ton of shows I don’t like (and may have been an asshole about it) and yet those are popular shows. What the best MCU movie is often up for debate as some say it’s Civil War while others say it's Winter Soldier (myself included). Media in general will always have differing opinions from one another, so it's pointless for others to taste “trash” since opinions will always be different. I just post these reviews to share my thoughts, see how many agree & disagree. That sounds like a contradiction, but it really isn’t as it’s a matter how you respond. But hey, that’s just me. I’ll be in my bunker if you need me",anime,1kkhdfp

"I need help identifying this Anime! (Lost media, for me at least) EDIT (FOUND): Rewrite Season 2      When I was around 15 (this was years ago), I came across an anime that, to this day, remains the best I've ever seen. I never finished it, and I've been trying to remember what it was ever since.  The anime had a Military tag in its description, although I don't recall much actual military content. The only military-esque scene I remember was a group of Humvees driving through a desert, which happened early on in the series before I stopped watching.  Format Key:  (??) = Not sure. Take it with a grain of salt.  (!!) = Confident this happened.  (?! ) = It's a possibility.  What I Remember:  * The main character (MC) was in an alternate world:    * The setting seemed abandoned, with decaying or broken-down buildings (??).    * It might have been permanently night, with a galaxy-like sky — but everything was still visible (??).    * The only characters in this world were the MC, maybe some spirits (??), and definitely a girl (!!).    * The MC would occasionally think about his old life or friends (?!). * The girl:    * Possibly had white hair (??).    * Had a long, thin red ribbon attached to her head (!!) — it may have been used as a weapon (??).    * She didn't seem to understand or respond to the MC's speech (at least in the episodes I saw).    * She was mysterious and silent.    * She stood on a circular magical platform, possibly linked to time, with glowing geometric patterns (??).       * The platform was located on a hill.       * Whenever the MC approached her, she would push him back using the ribbon (!!).       * She would stand there for days on end, not moving.  If this sounds familiar or rings any bells, please let me know! I'm happy to answer questions to help narrow it down further. I'll update the post as I recall more details.  Extra details:  * Definitely some space aspects but not exactly * Earth does exist but it's somewhere else * The MC interacts with these occasional entities, only some characters can see them though if any * This girls hair might be short, no where near her shoulders",anime,1kjdu0u
Help me find the scene Hello people of Reddit. I know you guys can help me. I only know this scene from memory from a video i watched on TikTok like 2020-2023.

She was holding the baby up and looking at it.

"A new trend in isekai anime So, recently, I have noticed that a lot of isekai anime seem to be built around the theme of 'supposedly weak party member gets kicked out of the party, only to turn out to be the heart of the party/strength of the party'. A lot of isekai.  Usually the above comment would be a preface to a long rant about how anime is running out of ideas, but to be honest, I like this trend.   I think that at the end an important lesson is being pushed out there, that when working in a team we all have our individual strenghts and chasing out a member on the grounds of weakness (when in reality, such assesnments are made on a flawed basis..because of the team leader allowing his personal emotions get the better of him/her/they.)..is a nice way to welcome disaster.  A quote from the 19th century novel *Silas Marner* is appropriate here(written by George Elliot, great novel).....*when a man turns away a blessing from his house, it goes to somewhere else.*  I hope that we do not allow our personal biases prevent us from seeing the potential in people.  Let the trend continue. Anime at the end is not just meant to entertain. Some of life's important lessons are lessons that are repeated over and over again in our hearing.(don't cross a busy street.).

"My Thoughts on Tomo-chan Is A Girl Tomo-chan Is A Girl was a breath of fresh air. Romance has been one of my favorite genres of anime ever since I was a teenager, but in recent years many shows have come out that a lot of others enjoyed, but I've found to be so unenjoyable. And anybody has the right to like whatever, criticism is subjective after all. My biggest gripe with the genre are the ones like Please Don't Toy With Me Miss Nagatoro, Uzaki-chan Just Wants to Hang Out, and Teasing Master Takagi-san, and also Gal Anjou-san, (which only has a manga right now, but still), that seem to permeate discourse surrounding romance anime, and I can't stand any of these ones. Maybe my bias is confusing me into thinking that they're more prevalent and more popular than they actually are, but nevertheless they seem to be everywhere whenever they're airing, which has made me feel distant from the genre. But Tomo-chan did something different by...taking me back to what I love about romance anime. The manga was written by Fumita Yanagida. Before this he was best known for writing hentai manga, (actually similar to Nanashi, the author of Nagatoro, and Shun Saeki, the illustrator of Shokugeki no Soma, or Food Wars. This was his first ever non hentai manga, and so far his only, and I desperately want him to write another one because of how great this one was.      All of the characters are endearing beyond words. The series doesn't have a massive cast of characters, but the characters that do exist are likeable, flawed, and feel real. There are six waifus in this series, and I honestly have a hard time choosing my favorite. Although i usually go back to Tomo, the protagonist, there are times when I want to pick her mother, Akemi (the milf tomboy, if you will). Tomo is engaging because we're made to sympathize with her story. She's been in love with Jun since childhood, but in grade school he legitimately thought that she was a boy because she didn't look or act like a girl stereotypically does. After entering middle school she had to wear women's clothing, so he inevitably figured it out. And it was shortly after this that he developed feelings for her, however he kept them buried inside, insisting on continuing to treat her as ""one of the guys"" so even in high school Tomo doesn't think Jun has any romantic feelings for him whatsoever, and has become increasingly insecure about her womanly charms and if she'll ever be able to win him over.      Her mother, like I said, is a milf tomboy, and is the best girl of many fans, understandably so. In fact, all six of the girls in this series have many people who consider them to be best girl, and none of their fanbases are even slightly difficult to find online. Misuzu Gundou is Tomo's other childhood friend, a tomboy in personality although not appearance, and has a cynical and domineering personality, and a very dark sense of humor, so of course I like her, (and occasionally a dry, sarcastic sense of humor, which I'm also a fan of. She dated Jun briefly in middle school, but it only lasted like 2 or 3 days max. Her mom, Misaki Gundou, is basically just an older version of her. Their personalities are basically identical, except the mother is obviously more mature. Carol Olston is a blond transfer student from the United Kingdom that somehow managed to smuggle an extremely powerful taser into Japan which she occasionally uses to defend her friends from thugs, and has a ditzy personality on the outside, but seems to know more about what's going on than it seems on the surface. This is proven to be true to some extent towards the end of the series when her insecurities and emotions start pouring out, and while that doesn't necessarily prove that she's privy to her friends feelings even as they try to hide them, I think there is ample evidence that she in fact does. And also that she has a sadistic side of her own, seeing as she's more than willing to shock people with her taser to defend her friends with a loveable, wholesome grin on her face. How nice.      And finally there's Carol's mother, Ferris Olston, who gave birth to Carol when she was 13, which caused some controversy online at the time, but not as much as I expected. All I'll say is that while there is some comedy surrounding it, it is treated with the necessary seriousness as well. It's explained that while it worked out for Ferris for the most part, as she was able to raise Carol, and Carol's father didn't abandon the family when he found out Ferris was pregnant, it was still extremely difficult for them, and also there's no guarantee that it would work with other people. That's the reason whenever Carol gets too close with her love interest, Misaki Kousuke, given their ages, Ferris intervenes, often by humorously blowing a whistle to harshly catch their attention. That's one thing this series doers incredibly well, better than most recent romance anime, is mixing humor with seriousness to give this mix of emotions that helps expertly tell the story that the author is trying to tell, and making me feel for the characters. It also demonstrates the flaws of the characters, too. I said before my belief that Carol is smarter than she lets on, and I stand by that, but she is also an emotional teenager, and sometimes her emotions do get the better of her and she doesn't think straight. This is especially the case when Misaki, whom she's deeply in love with, starts showering her with compliments and affection, and Ferris knows what happens when emotion overrides reasoning, and thus is eager to intervene.      This mix of comedy and seriousness is present in developing the other characters as well. Misaki Gundou is typically shown being serious, cynical, and kind of bitchy. Like, she's not very approachable at all. Jun and Tomo are her best friends, but they've been friends since childhood and thus they know that she's not as bad as her surface level appearance lets on. But to most everyone else she seems like a grizzly, bad tempered girl whom nobody would want to interact with. However, there are hints that she does want romance like her friends are getting, but she just doesn't know how to express that desire properly. The example of this is the character Tatsumi Tanabe. Throughout a good portion of the series he spent time asking her out, and got constantly reject by her. At first it seemed like this would just be a running gag that would have no deeper meaning behind it. However, towards the end of the series, Misaki rejects him again, but this time it's by telling him that if he wants her to give him a chance he needs to come at her with full confidence and passion, or something like that (paraphrased, because I don't remember the exact line of dialogue, or the episode that it was in). Now you might say that he was just giving her a random piece of advice because she felt bad for his constant failures, but I think it's more likely that she had a secret desire to find a boyfriend herself, but she didn't want to be with a man who wasn't confident and passionate, and being himself rather than being someone else to try and impress her, and he was literally the only man who ever confessed to her, or at least the only man who confessed to her frequently, so she gave him that advice to see if he'd be able to overcome his insecurities and give her a confession that she felt was genuine and worthy of accepting.      With that being said however, that is probably my only major complaint with the series, that this romantic sub plot doesn't really go anywhere in the end. And the anime completely adapts the manga as well. It's not that I'm inherently against female characters in anime and manga, even romance anime and manga, being independent by the end of it, but it's very disappointing when an author is very clearly setting up a romantic sub plot, but then just randomly drops the idea out of nowhere, without even a final confession and rejection after the conversation I highlighted above, or without Tatsumi deciding on his own not to confess to her again and to give up on her. It's the one blemish on this otherwise great series for me, but it doesn't diminish how great this anime is in my opinion.      But of course, Tomo and Jun's relationship is the meat and stuffing, so to speak, of Tomo-chan Is A Girl, so it's a great thing that it's handled as well as it is. Sympathy is framed towards both of them because of of their well defined insecurities, but at the same time he also manages to frame them both as being kind of dense. Which is a breath of fresh air, because normally it's just one of the two in the potential relationship that are depicted as being dense, (usually the guy, sadly), but in this show they're equal in that regard. They're both incredibly dense, because both of their feelings are incredibly obvious, so obvious that even many other characters within the series can clearly see it, but neither of them are able to tell that the other feels the same way. However, they never come off as so stupid that they become unlikeable. Both of them have some good reasons why they might not be able to tell. To Jun's defense Tomo still doesn't look very feminine aside from her breasts which are more pronounced than when she was younger obviously, and to Tomo's defense Jun literally doesn't treat her any differently than any of his guy friends. Also to Jun's defense Tomo is a Tsundere who hits him a lot; now we genre savvy anime watchers will look at that and say ""obviously she likes him"", but you have to look at it from the perspective of the characters in universe. From their perspective, that would probably tell them the same thing it would tell us in real life, that the person either doesn't like us at all, or at the very least is not in love with us. Especially if the characters aren't Otaku, which none of these characters are.      Overall, Tomo-chan Is A Girl is one of my favorite romance anime in a long time, as well as one of my favorite anime of this year so far too. It has a few pitfalls, but that doesn't diminish the sheer quality of character, humor, and wholesomeness that I love to see in this type of anime and manga. Like I said before, I really do hope that the author writes another non hentai manga sometime soon, because he did an amazing job with this one. It's not as good as the five romance anime that I consider to be my absolute favorites--Toradora, My Dress-Up Darling, Horimiya, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, and Lovely Complex, but it's still great, and it COULD have been that good if it completed that Misuzu Gundou romance sub plot that was dropped randomly, and made the characters a bit more deep and the scenarios a bit more funny.",anime,1kjnn3w

Frieren and Solo Leveling were both great in their own right, but they didn’t quite hit the same heights as AOT for me.  I’m now looking for my next watch.

"Anime to show my 60 year old mom? We live together for now and often watch TV together. She enjoys mature story lines and can't tolerate too much wacky/silliness. She also isn't big on things thar are too ""out there"" but if the story is good enough, she might be persuaded.   She tends to like emotional, heartfelt, dramatic or romantic things. But I doubt she'd care about 99.9% of romance anime, especially since they are about people much younger than her usually.   She enjoyed spirited away and I have considered showing her Dandadan.

"Anime recommendations with emphasis training/levelling up I haven’t watched much anime before, namely just AOT, Death note, 7ds, and Naruto.   I’m currently watching Naruto Shippuden, and I’m in the middle of a training arc. I realised I prefer shows where the protagonist starts off weak but trains/increases power levels slowly.  However the pacing in Naruto is unbearable. I’ve been told to skip the fillers but even that is very very slow. It’s something I admired much more about AOT, and is one of the biggest reasons I loved it.  Does anyone have any recommendations for similar type anime’s? I don’t care too much for genre, but as long as it’s not too long (3-4 season max). I asked chat gpt and it said Demon Slayer, JJK, Mob Psycho, Vinland Saga, and HxH.   Are those recommendations good? Do they have good emphasis on training/levelling up? I also prefer plot twists but it’s not a big requirement. Are there any other anime’s you’d recommend?

"I HAVE A CRAVING FOR ANGST Hey there Reddit hive mind, lend me your wisdom! 🙏   I'm on the hunt for some romance anime with a specific flavor profile and hoping you can point me in the right direction. I'm craving something with:  Angsty Female Lead (FL): Think maybe a bit jaded, perhaps even with a ""leave me alone"" vibe, possibly carrying some emotional baggage.  Rescuer & Outgoing Male Lead (ML): The sunshine type! Someone who's maybe a bit oblivious to her initial coldness and determined to break through her shell. A real ray of light. Ideally, I'd love a scene similar to this (and yes, I know it's specific!):  The FL is in a dark place and maybe even contemplates something drastic (you know... the big oof).   The ML intervenes and catches her in the nick of time.   The FL, instead of being grateful, might get angry or try to push him away, still wanting to be left alone.   BUT, despite her resistance, the ML's genuine care shines through, leading to a heartfelt confession from him.   Ultimately (and hopefully!), the FL's walls crumble, and she reciprocates his feelings. Does anything like this ring a bell for anyone? I'm open to any suggestions, whether it's a popular title or a hidden gem! The angstier the FL and the brighter the ML, the better! Thanks in advance for your amazing recs! ❤️",anime,1kkgj0n

"What's up with adult swim and dogshit anime originals? First Ninja Kamui and now lazarus, every time I get baited into thinking adult swim released something good, but no, first episode is usually the best one, and the quality just gets drastically worse as the series progresses.  Ninja Kamui baited everyone by giving a 10/10 first episode, and then everything became dogshit.  Lazarus had a good start, episode 1 wasn't 10/10, but it was decent. We are 6 episodes in and there has been no progress towards finding skinner, not even a little.  Every episode is just ""villain of the week"" in a 12 episode anime, half the show is over and pretty much everything except episode 1 is filler. Episode 5 felt like it was making some progress, but it just turned out to be some romanticized version of a ""hacker"" battle  that contributed nothing to finding skinner.  Episode 6 was just outright horrendous, i don't wanna talk too much about it, cus there is a discussion thread but man adult swim shows are dogshit cash grabs.  They keep trying to bank on the director's success with previous shows.  With Ninja Kamui it was ""Sunghoo Park - DIRECTOR OF JJK SEASON 1""  Now with Lazarus it's ""Shinichirō Watanabe - DIRECTOR OF SAMURAI CHAMPLOO AND COWBOY BEBOP""   Having a someone who directed successful shows in the past isn't gonna make the dogshit story any better,",anime,1klc55y

"Just a Thought: Why is misogyny in anime so normal? Been thinking lately about how common implicit misogyny is in anime — not just in ecchi or 18+ stuff, but even in regular, mainstream series. It’s not just about fanservice, it’s how so many female characters feel like they exist just to serve male characters or play into tropes with zero agency. I get it's not *every* anime, but it feels like enough to warrant being addressed.  What gets to me is how *normal* it all is — barely any pushback, especially in Japan, but even Western fans kinda just accept it like it’s part of the genre. And yeah, that sucks for women, but it also sets the stage for misandry to fester too. When we ignore one kind of discrimination, it makes space for others to grow, and the cycle keeps spinning.  Not trying to deny male privilege exists — just saying that *any* kind of discrimination, left unchecked, turns toxic.  Anyone else feel this?  ^((Maybe i feel this intensely about it bc I'm black & asian and grew up with a super diverse family, but in a predominantly white country, so any kind of discrimination feels especially intolerable.))",anime,1kk10e4
"Umamusume: Cinderella Gray Ep 5 Breakdown – The Real History Behind Ep 5: What's Best For Her  **Intro:**  Joke of the day:   Do you know how a red dragon plans their day?   Answer: they don’t, they just wing \~ it  [Art by AIOM](  (Amazing art! Go check it out!   |   **The Titans**    If you are a fan of the Umamusume franchise, you should be familiar with these characters. But in case you are a new fan. I will briefly introduce these horses —In every thrilling story, there are always a few legendary figures — heroes whose feats become **timeless legends**, celebrated by generations to come as they are regarded as **the very strongest**.  In *Cinderella Gray*, those legends are brought to life by the three *Uma Musume* standing before u  **Maruzensky; Symboli Rudolf; Mr C.B.**    Behold! **The titans of Japanese turf**. Each one of them had crafted extremely illustrious images in their careers. Since they will continue to show up quite regularly and even play some crucial roles at times. I’m only going to briefly introduce the two legend that show up this episode: Symboli Rudolf and Maruzensky  **“The Emperor” - Symboli Rudolf**  [Symboli Rudolf](  **The first undefeated Triple Crown Winner** in Japan; G1 7 wins. Due to his overwhelming dominance on the racetrack, it was said:  **“In horse racing, nothing is absolute — except for that horse.”**  As the emperor of Japanese horse racing, Symboli Rudolf needed no words to describe his greatness. The horse itself once conquered distances from 1000 m to 3200 m. Autopiloting most of his races as if he knew the **correct answer** to the victory. In the prime of Symboli Rudolf, because he won almost every race he entered, **his odds were consistently abysmal** (even 1.0)—leaving bettors to lament, *“It’s always this guy winning... there’s just no money to be made!”*. This is Symboli Rudolf. This is why in Uma Musume, he stands forever as the **Student Council President** — a symbol of unwavering greatness.    However, an interesting fact about the story/ the real life of Cinderella gray is that Oguri Cap started her racing journey **not too long after the retirement of Symboli Rudolf**. When Symboli Rudolf retired in 1986, it felt like a gaping hole was left in the heart of Japanese horse racing. The sport, once vibrant, suddenly fell into **the most boring age of Japanese horse racing** (probably why Rudolf and Maruzensky are searching for talents rn). But 1988, **two gray horses** would ignite a wildfire across the racing world, ushering in a new era of racing fever. Soon after, familiar names like **Mejiro McQueen**, **Tokai Teio**, **Rice Shower**, **BNW**,  **Narita Brian** and many others. Countless star horses stepped onto the stage, leading Japan from the most boring age to **the golden age** of horse racing in the 1990s during its economic crisis.    **“The Supercar” - Maruzensky**    \*\*Invincible.\*\*   If you simply look at her character design and get the feeling that Maruzensky is a **gentle and adorable horse** that probably did not shout dominance in her career. Then you couldn’t be more wrong. Maruzensky wasn’t just an **undefeated** *Uma Musume*; throughout its career, no horse ever came close to threatening her dominanc  In her debut race, she finished **more than two seconds** ahead of the runner-up — winning over ten lengths. Every race afterward was a one-sided dominance. Her dominance was so absolute that **the races lost excitement to watch**. Almost like Demetrious Johnson back in the UFC.  By the later stages of her career, just the name itself was enough to send rivals retreating without even entering the race. At the end, Maruzensky retired with a perfect **8 starts 8 wins**, winning by a combined margin of **61 lengths** over her second-place finishers with mere 8 races. Never truly being challenged throughout the entire career.     Because the unmatched superiority never felt like others were competing with a horse; therefore, earned Maruzensky a fitting nickname **“Supercar.”**  |  **Your dream has become my dream**    In real life at this time of the story, there was a growing push to **move Oguri Cap to the JRA**, where the competition — and the spotlight — was even bigger. For the racing community, it surely was exciting news to hear, on the surface.  But, as always, **history isn’t that straight forward**. Behind Oguri Cap’s transfer lies a series of **bittersweet, complicated stories**.    And that's where **Kitahara Jou** comes in — a character in *Cinderella Gray* **based on a blend of several figures** who were deeply involved in Oguri’s real-life journey：  **安藤勝己** \- staring with the least significant person to decide the fate of Oguri Cap - his jockey. At the time, 安藤勝己 did not possess a JRA license. Thus, if Oguri Cap stepped onto the grand stage he deserved, he could do nothing but watch from afar, unable to ride the horse ever again. But 13 years after, 安藤勝己 would finally earn his JRA license. He would guide many great horses to victory, including the illustrious **Daiwa Scarlet**, and, in time, carve his own name into the history of Japanese horse racing.  **小栗孝一** \- The owner of Oguri Cap. To 小栗孝一, Oguri Cap was not merely a racehorse; **Oguri Cap was the first horse he had ever owned who showed such extraordinary promise**. However, without a JRA owner’s license, 小栗孝一 could not accompany his champion onto the grand stage of Central racing. If Oguri Cap were to advance, it would mean surrendering his beloved horse — selling him away, **forfeiting any future earnings** Oguri Cap will make. But, far more painfully, severing a bond forged through unwavering love.    To 小栗孝一, Oguri Cap was nothing less than **his own son** he had nurtured and protected even when the world doubted Oguri Cap’s worth. The idea of selling “his son” was too cruel to bear. Therefore, he stood his ground, refusing to give up his horse no matter the cost. And he was not alone with this mentality. On the other hand, **Oguri Cap’s trainer** stood firmly on his side –  **鷲見昌勇** \- As a trainer for regional racing, the devotion from him to Oguri Cap was no less profound than the owner. Yet, transferring Oguri Cap means losing the horse he had nurtured.    But beyond that, for years, 鷲見昌勇 had harbored **a singular dream** — a lifelong dream to dominate the **Tokai Derby**. The culmination of a lifetime of struggle and hope — a dream he had worked toward for decades. With Oguri Cap, **that dream was finally within reach**. Victory at the Tokai Derby was no longer a distant fantasy, but a tangible future. It was almost right there in the reach of a hand  Thus, he and the owner had bounded together to chase their intertwined dreams. Yet at the end of the day, anyone other than the owner had no final say on this transfer. Should 小栗孝一 choose to transfer Oguri Cap. Then **what had all his effort become?** **What did their dream mean to each other?** This transfer would be nothing less than a **betrayal** of everything they had fought for together    When we understand the real stories behind these men, we gain a deeper appreciation for the emotional turmoil inside **Kitahara Jou**, the character who represents them in *Cinderella Gray*. He had made a promise to Oguri Cap, and in that bond of trust, **a single man’s dream had become something shared**, something sacred. Indeed, Sending Oguri Cap to the URA might be **What's Best For Her**. But what about his dream? What about their bond? What about everything he went through alone?  We may never truly know the weight they bore in their hearts, but what is certain is this: whichever path they chose, it was a choice that came with **unimaginable sacrifice**.  [\\""This is my dream as well, because this is your dream, right?\\""](  |   **For The Best Of Her**   This is the title for this episode. For that it is what **Symboli Rudolf** tried to persuade **Kitahara Jo**. But after understanding the real historical background for Kitahara Jo, we get to know how much this decision really means. For many of us, Choosing transferring Oguri Cap might be such a natural decision. But behind it is a decision of lack of sympathy for the owner.    At the age of 25, this young man had planted **a dream**. And as time passed by, age brought wrinkles to his face. Brought the color of gray to his hair. And the sole dream he once planted in his heart. Never once did he give up.   When Symboli Rudolf said **“do what’s best for her.”** It is also another way to say, **“give up your dream.”** In real life situations, so many times in a relationship or in parenting, “This is what’s best for you” means taking something away from you out of people’s own belief.    But after criticizing what Symboli Rudolf said. Kitahara Jo also gave Oguri Cap a decision that shift the weight of this decision to her:  **“If you win, you will go to URA. but if you lose, you will stay here.”**  After knowing Oguri Cap wants to pursue their shared dream. After knowing Oguri Cap does not want to lose. He chose to run away from the decision and shift it to Oguri Cap. This is also irresponsible for a trainer.   In ep 3 I made a post to emphasize on the following scene:    The Uma Musume tearfully venting to her trainer also has a real-life counterpart—one who, both in the anime and in real life, was a mob character. She will in time fade away from everyone’s memory both in the show and in real life. And yet, even through all the defeats, she knows her trainer never once stopped believing in her. If you are a trainer. You will never stop believing in your own talent. Yet, Kitahara Jo chose to run away and hope for a defeat. Something a trainer never should do.   Ep 3 Breakdown:   Ep3:   **Now the question is, what will Oguri Cap do?**  |  ***“gray horses can’t run fast”***  Upon this time of the Japanese horse racing community, there's long been a saying - *“gray horses can’t run fast”*    At this point of Japanese horse racing. There have not been many powerful gray horses achieving greatness. That’s why people said gray horses cannot run fast. This saying befits well with the name of the show ***Cinderella Gray***. Because 1988 was meant to be a year of color gray. Very soon, **multiple gray horses** will completely shut down this saying. And after the story of this anime, **Mejiro Mcqueen** would take on the title of **“the new gray horse legend”** seamlessly. Then to **Biwa Hayahide** right afterward. As time passed by, more and more gray horses would take on this title. Achieving new height for the legend of gray. But the first gray horse to truly shut down this saying, is the following horse – **Tamamo Cross**  |  **From Losing Streak to Winning Streak**    This scene depicted the historical fact of Tamamo Cross, after enduring immense suffering, finally bloomed into greatness. Coincidentally, right **after Oguri Cap's debut**, Tamamo Cross completely exploded. Ending his losing streak and turn into **an unstoppable winning streak**. Both of them are gray horses, both of them were not look highly upon on their early days. But it seems their fate is somehow intertwined with one another. And their fate, is meant to cross path...   This race, despite not being shown in the anime, was **a spectacular win**. During the final straight, Tamano Cross was stuck with five other horses, completely walling him off from the final sprint. Just as everyone was hopeless for the situation, Tamamo Cross spotted an opening along the **innermost lane** and surged through, claiming a dramatic **six-length victory** in the blink of an eye. After a long, brutal losing streak, **The White Lightning**, left the world chasing shadows in his wake.    If you are curious about Tamamo Cross’s early life with a short introduction. I highly recommend checking out the last part of my previous post:  [  |  \*\*Be Ready\~\*\*Next episode is, in manga, the point where I was hooked into this series. I am very curious how the anime will choose to ground the audience into the emotional reality of the ongoing story. Don’t want to spoil anything.

Any discussion of events that occur in future episodes are required to be hidden under a spoiler tag. Also please refrain from any ""laugh as rewatcher"" or other type of behavior that while not outright spoiling something, implies a spoiler.  ***  **Production/Background Information**  Today's episode features a couple of usages of the song that inspired the name of both the anime and the novel it was based on, ""From the New World"". The song was composed by Czechoslovakian composer Antonin Dvorak in 1893. At that time he was the director of the National Conservatory of Music in America and the song premiered during a symphony in New York City. The full length of the song is 40 minutes, with us obviously only hearing a small piece of it here. The song is so well regarded that Neil Armstrong brought a recording of it with him during the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969.  **Seiyuu of the Day**  The show's cast isn't large enough for this to be an every day feature, but I often do this in rewatches I participate in and figured I'd include it here as host! Today's seiyuu of the day is **Risa Taneda**, who plays **Saki Watanabe**. Her most notable role for me beyond this is Kaori Miyazono, the female lead of Your Lie in April. I haven't seen her in much major things beyond these two roles, but Wikipedia tells me some of her other notable roles include Mirai Kiriyama in Beyond the Boundary (incidentally enough an anime that my Shin Sekai Yori bluray has a preview of on it), Yukina Himeragi in Strike the Blood, Rize Tedeza in Is The Order a Rabbit and Erina Nakiri in Food Wars. She is also the singer of this show's ending song, ""Wareta Ringo"".  ***  **Questions of the Day**  1) As mentioned above we get a couple of instances of the classical symphony From the New World in this episode.

"I actually thought School Days was quite good Those first 9 out of 12 episodes were very very well written. I'm 29 and well beyond my early days of relationships back in high school, so I say this with a lot less pain...   I've been in that exact position of Katsura. Things went from texting constantly all night to three hours in between each response. You're putting in the effort but they don't even pretend to care. You don't know what's going on and you don't know why because they refuse to even talk about your relationship. Then you find out that the entire reason is another person. You were just there to fulfil a void. Physical intimacy. Emotional availability. Whatever it was, you were just there until someone better came along. And my god, when you're genuinely in love, that shit does lifelong psychological damage. Its traumatic. I will have trust issues the rest of my life, I just don't vocalize them, nor do I snoop to try and validate them.   Just to give some context: From 17-21 I was dating a girl that I thought was the love of my life. Found out she got picked up **from my house** by another guy from our high school to go and fuck. Idk how long it was going on, but it happened several times before this occasion. That one was just the first time I found out. It cut the deepest and showed me that you can never truly know someone to their core.      On another note, I thought the entire fan-service self insert fuck fest and Higurashi: When They Cry brutal stabbing angle were not particularly great. Just wanted to say that they did a good job of showing the absolute anguish that cheating causes a person, and how mentally catastrophic it can be.",anime,1k3gygh

"Just finished this 5” Pokémon Ghost Diorama (Pokémon) I tried giving the clear resin pieces a fluorescent glow by adding some glow effect paint which kind of works but it doesn't show up good in photos so I omitted that.  I do like the foggyness of the effects though!  There are some problems, haunters face being the biggest; you can see the poorly matched paint and his eyes feel a little murky.  I struggled cleaning up the eyes and had to redo large sections inside the eye cup, but once I hit an acceptable spot, I refused to touch it again.  It was kinda exciting free handing it with some magnifying glasses and 000 brush.  I also wish I took more time to clean the model up during and after varnishing.

"Wind Breaker is so surprisingly lovable. One of the best anime currently running (in my opinion) is dropping episodes once more for its sophomore season! If you haven't given this one a shot yet, I really recommend trying it out.   I went into it very blind, not really expecting a ton, and the first episode is probably one of the weaker entries it puts out, so it didn't quite blow me away instantly.. but it immediately starts picking up steam and turns into such an entertaining ride.  The premise is thoroughly ridiculous (rival high-schools operate like gangs/fight clubs/found families and roam around beating the hell out of each other with seemingly zero adult supervision) but it absolutely works because the show plays it fully and completely straight, giving an air of wonderful sincerity to the whole endeavor; it's genuinely very wholesome. It's got Fights & Feelings, it's got Bros giving each other affection and support in between brawls... It is, in a word, awesome.  That's not to say that it will work for everyone; I absolutely see that part of the reason why I'm liking the show so much is because it's speaking to me on an emotional level, and it might hit you differently.. but I really do think that it does a lot of things right: it gives every member of its ensemble cast real personality and charm, and it gives them time to interact and bond in a way that endears them to you and develops their characters all at once. The show actually focuses on character more than fights.. and that really helps you care about the outcome whenever the characters actually do start throwing down.   It's sweet, it's silly, and it's produced a couple of seriously smooth fights so far. I dig this show.",anime,1ki4gg2

"Scenes where the character is so angry they just skip talking and instantly attack There’s tons and tons of scenes where thing happens that makes the protagonist incredibly angry. But many of these scenes still have a bunch of talking or powering up before the actual fight happens.   I’m curious about examples where thing happens and, after the initial shock, the attack *instantly* happens. No words, no posturing, no powering up, bonus points if it subverts expectations by having the antagonist/enemy/whatever start talking thinking they’ll get to say their piece only to get immediately attacked mid-sentence.   The times when the protagonist is so beyond any words or self control that they enter instant berserk mode without any of the classic anime tropes of exposition first.",anime,1khu7l2

Also please refrain from any ""laugh as rewatcher"" or other type of behavior that while not outright spoiling something, implies a spoiler.  ***  **Production/Background Information**  Yesterday I spoke about Shin Sekai Yori's original creator, Yusuke Kishi, today I'll talk a little more about the novel itself. It was originally published on January 23, 2008 in two volumes, by Kodansha. It was re-released in 2009, as one volume and 2011 as three volumes. As I mentioned yesterday it unfortunately hasn't been officially published in English. Kishi had originally come up with the story back in the 1980s as a novella. He had the original idea for it after reading the book King Solomon's Ring by Konrad Lorenz. To avoid spoilers I will refrain from providing specifics.  **Seiyuu of the Day**  Today's seiyuu of the day is **Kana Hanazawa**, who plays **Maria Akizuki**. Probably the biggest name in the cast, some of her most famous roles include Mayuri Shiina in Steins Gate, Nadeko Sengoku in Monogatari, Akane Tsunemori in Psycho Pass, Shirase Kobuchizawa in A Place Further Than the Universe, Anri Sonohara in Durarara!, Ichika Nakano in The Quintessential Quintuplets and Hinata Kawamoto in March Comes in Like a Lion. Other roles of hers include the nameless protagonist of The Night is Short, Walk On Girl, Seryuu in Akame ga Kill, Ayase Shinomiya in Guilty Crown, Aoi Fukasaku in Coppelion, Suiko Minahoshi/Imaginator in Boogiepop and Others and Envy Adams in Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.  ***  **Questions of the Day**  1) Do you believe any of the stories that Satoru told in this episode?  2) How would you react if a nearby animal told you it was actually a library?",anime,1kh9vw9

"Orb: On the Movement of the Earth ""The idea that knowledge must be useful to other people or to society is nonsense."" I'm getting to the end of the series and what Rafal says in episode 24 resonated deeply with me. I remember that back in high school I was deeply interested in epistemology, particularly in regards to the limits of our faculties and how they help form many of our biases. I was never particularly good at explaining things to my mother, who I guess was a bit of the impatient sort, wanting clear answers. So for her to understand it I had to start at the very foundations, in retrospect I think it made her feel stupid, so she began to quickly dismiss those ideas claiming their lack of utility. I think that put a huge damper to my motivation to keep learning. Is this how society kills the curiosity of children? Anyway, I was watching that episode and a lot of memories like that came flooding back. I'm really thankful for all the people that kept recommending this show.  This is really off topic in terms of anime, but have you ever felt curbed like that?     Edit: Just finished the last episode.

He is the series director of Casshern Sins, which came out a few years before this. An industry veteran who has worked going back to the mid 1970s, he has been involved with franchises such as Dragonball Z and Saint Seiya and seems to jump all over the place with a lot of single episode credits for various anime such as Penguindrum, Brain Powered, Chihayafuru, Pretty Cure and others.   If you didn't like the way this episode looked, well the good news is that he only does the episode director/storyboard combo for one other episode in the show (one I consider a lot better than this one) and does the storyboard for one additional episode.  The episode is generally looked down upon, but [here]( is a link to at least one reviewer who really likes Yamauchi's work.  **Seiyuu of the Day**  Today's seiyuu of the day is **Kanako Tojo**, who plays **Satoru Asahina**.

Specific reason for that!

It was under spoiler tags despite the Soul Gem reveal (which is a big part of why I was making this speculation) because a different theory I have been looking at more closely this time around based on this episode's reveals: Kyubey is basically a waldo/drone/remote projection.

"FLCL 25th Anniversary Rewatch Announcement Thread Hey, guys. Holofan4life here.   In exactly four weeks from today, we will be doing the 25th Anniversary Rewatch of FLCL.   ##What is FLCL about?  Naota Nandaba is an ordinary sixth grader living in a city where nothing amazing ever seems to happen. After his brother Tasuku leaves town to play baseball in America, Naota takes it upon himself to look after everything Tasuku left behind—from his top bunk bed to his ex-girlfriend Mamimi Samejima, who hasn't stopped clinging to Naota since Tasuku left.  Little does Naota know, however, that his mundane existence is on the verge of being changed forever: enter Haruko Haruhara, a Vespa-riding, bass guitar-wielding, pink-haired psychopath whose first encounter with Naota leaves him with tire tracks on his back and a giant horn on his head. Though all he wants is some peace and quiet, when Haruko takes up residence at his parents' home, Naota finds himself dragged into the heart of the greatest battle for supremacy that Earth—and quite possibly the entire universe—has ever seen.  ##Why should I watch FLCL?  FLCL is the definitive coming of age anime. It is the show that influenced an entire generation who grew up on Toonami. It has probably the best soundtrack of any anime show ever. There are many reasons to like FLCL, but I think the primary reason is its ability to combine coming of angst with out of control zeitgeist type humor, the likes of which barely any other show was doing in 2000. Maybe Family Guy, but that's about it.  I don't think there is an anime that influenced my type of humor more than FLCL. It's in contention for greatest anime comedy of all time, but even that is shortchanging it. When people discuss the greatest OVA series of all time, this show almost immediately comes to mind. And it's time after 25 years to experience yet again the greatness that is FLCL.  ##Series information  [MAL]( | [Anilist]( | [AniDB]( | [ANN](  ##Where to watch  FLCL - None   FLCL Alternative -   FLCL Shoegaze -   Yes, you heard that right.  **Not only we will be watching the original FLCL, but we will also be watching two of its sequel series as well.**  ##Proposed schedule   The rewatch will begin two months from now on June 1st, with one episode being watched each day and the threads being posted at 6:00 PM EDT. We will not be watching every series but instead the ones where it's actually in my opinion good. **First, we will start off with the original FLCL series. Then after a one day break, we will begin FLCl Alternative, otherwise known as the third FLCL series. Then after one more one day break, we will be finishing off with FLCL Shoegaze, with an overall series discussion thread the day after.**  This is a rather unique way of doing a rewatch. Instead of doing every single series, or just the original, we are focusing on the original and some of the more underrated seasons. I hope with this rewatch that it can help people who've never FLCL before learn just why the show is held in such high regard. **I also hope that any rewatchers out there decide to give Alternative and Shoegaze a look, because I think it’s just as good if not better in some cases than the original series.**  That's it for now. Let me know if you are interested in participating. Until then, I'll see you around.",anime,1keuait

"I watched every 2004 anime (kinda) I watched every winter 2004 anime (kinda)  So I made a challenge for myself to watch every anime from 2004 (not including ovas, one, movies, and sequels from anime that started in previous years, and no hentai or kids shows obviously)  I chose 2004 specifically, because it's the year I was born lol .  Anyways I recently finished up the winter season of 2004 and I think I wanna do a quick review of everything I watched and dropped (spoiler: I dropped more shows than I completed). So anyways let's get it started I only want to keep each review a few sentences long.  Also I watched dubbed mostly when I can  COMPLETED Paranoia agent/mousou dairinin: This anime made me nervous by the genre alone, I have never watched a horror anime before. However by the end I was more confused than scared. What I thought was supposed to be a serial killer mystery anime turned into a philosophy esoteric wtf art piece. I guess the main theme was mass hysteria?. Idk it was very confusing but I can't say I was bored plus the opening was a banger and the animation was solid 7/10.  Yumeria: harem anime, i had no opinions on it but Yumeria was a delightful experience, mainly character was based, I thought mone was cute (not in a weird way) how she said her name over and over again, the harem relationship seemed kinda wholesome and I enjoyed the slice of life moments with the main cast, although the depressing undertones of the dream world coming to destroy the real world might have exemplified that. Fight choreography and animation was mid but I did like the artstyle. Ending made no sense at all but 8/10  Daphne in the brilliant blue: this anime looks weird at first. All female main cast in skimpy outfits doing vigilante work. But despite that it had really chill vibes, although most of the characters where like walking archetypes I enjoyed them and their moments, some the action was pretty good. The sub plot of the main character main having amnesia was the best part of the show and that whole mystery, I like the setting of a future world where global warming turned the world into islands. Very vibey ost and art style. Best opening theme of the season imo, and shizuka best girl no further questions 8/10  Area 88: topgun the anime, it's about fighter jets that's it, protagonist is stoic badass who wins everytime and he's trying to get money to see his girl again, it has sweet moments but it's not really that deep, cgi on the planes was ok for 2004. Now while the show itself is mid I  have to talk about the ost. Cause good god the ost is perfect, it's trance,house music. Words cannot describe how hyped I was when  awakening hit, I really love electronica music so seeing it in an anime was sick 6/10   DROPPED BUT MIGHT COME BACK TO  Maria watches over us: sweet girl love anime in a catholic school, it seems like it would be a vibe but I just wasn't feeling in the first couple episodes, it's very slow and calm. I would definitely try to watch it again because it feels like one of those animes you have to be in a certain mood to watch. Side note the opening theme kinda sounds like it could be a pokemon ost.  Yugo the negotiator: idk why I dropped this it seems interesting actually maybye I just want in the mood, it's about a Japanese man going to Pakistan to negotiate with terrorists, and he sorta moves his way around Pakistan figuring out what to do, idk the Pakistan setting seems so interesting to me I'm for sure returning to this.  Monkey turn: anime about boat racing i think, anyways couldn't watch it because every site i tried watching it on had messed up subtitles like the sentences made no sense and there is no dub, I will be willing to give it an actual chance if a watchable version is out there    DROPPED FOR GOOD  Gokusen: wasn't interested, it's about this teacher who's actually in the yakuza who basically has to put up with delinquent kids, it's not a god awful anime I just didn't vibe with it  Burn up scramble: it's kinda like Daphne in the brilliant blue but more generic and fanservice that's less tasteful, really wasn't messing with it  Kit a e diamond dust drops: romance anime i think maybye? Idk seemed boring but the opening was a straight banger  Chou henshin cosprayera: genuinely don't remember much except magical girl, or pretend magical girl? Idk, i fell asleep during it and the episodes are like 5 minutes long for some reason and also nudity in the end credits like what?  Futari wa precure: actual magical girl, two middle schoolers kicking ass oh yeah, but it felt repetitive and villain of the week esc, now I know precure is a MASSIVE franchise so let me know if this anime pops the f off later on or not, it was just okay I guess.   So all in all it was just an ok season, some enjoyable stuff, mostly mid, and some garbage  I will be on to spring 2004 next",anime,1ki0cgf

"Where does the ""battle shonen"" genre come from, culturally? I should probably start off with an explanation. A while back I got into an ~~argument~~ strongly-worded debate with a guy on DeviantArt who really hated anime. He made a big fuss about how most anime in the ""battle shonen"" genre are apparently inspired by the Chinese Imperial Civil Service Exam, which he hated for some reason. Of course, I found out later that this guy was a raging racist who despised *anything* East Asian, but that's neither here nor there.   Now obviously most of you here will be familiar with the battle shonen genre, but as a refresher here are some key traits of the genre:  * The main character aspires to be the best at a certain skill, which despite the name of the genre does not have to be combat-related (*Food Wars,* for example, is about cooking). * There is some kind of hierarchy involved in this skill, and the main character will face recurring rivals who have the same goal. * The villains appear in order of escalating evil, with the most threatening ones not entering the story until the climax. * There is usually a heavy emphasis on the fights themselves, with one-on-one clashes between characters often taking up entire episodes. * A distinction is often made between the protagonist's rivals and the actual villains, with the former usually being ""reformed"" after the protagonist defeats them. * The protagonist usually has an excitable, enthusiastic personality, often contrasted with a more level-headed and calculating rival.  So my question to you all is, what are the *real* cultural roots of this genre? The guy on DeviantArt was an all-around jerk, but was he right about where the genre comes from?",anime,1ke0cri

I cant find an anime I watched 3 years ago and I want to rewatch so bad. The anime I watched was like the average harem anime from the 2020-2011 period. In the first episode something happened and the mc woke up in the medical office in his highschool. Then some other students went there for him and tried to take him away somewhere. Thats when he fought back and he manifested powers to wield a sword. One of the students was a girl with pistol powers and the other one was a boy with greatsword powers. After that the mc joined them and I forgot what happens but mostly of the plot was the mc wanting to kill someone and take revenge. The anime has 2 short seasons and if im not mistaken the one who he wants to kill so he can take revenge turns out to be his long lost brother but we see them fight in the last episode of the last season and the brother runs away. The mc was a overpowered swordsman. If somebody knows the anime I would really appreciate it because I think the brother wanted to turn the world into chaos and the mc was furious in the end of the anime and I just want to rewatch it.,anime,1kartmg

"The Oldest Shounen Battle Anime date to the 50s, the first generation of Anime I saw [this post]( from this very sub, discussing the origins of the ""battle shounen"" genre, and I saw people tossing out anime from the 1980s like Fist of the North Star or Dragonball as being the origins of the genre.  Being that pre-1980s anime are virtually inaccessible outside of Japan, I suppose I shouldn't find this surprising, but I thought it might be helpful for people to learn a little about early anime history.  Anime's origins date back to the pre-war period, but very few examples survive to the present day.  Most anime were produced as part of news reels or other short form productions--full on feature anime films were not made till the post-war era in Japan.  The first television broadcasting of anime began in Japan in 1963, which were also the first television anime adaptations of popular manga.  So in many ways, anime--in the way we think of anime in their modern form, really begins in my opinion in 1963.  3 shows aired in that year, out of which the most famous, and perhaps most influential of which is Testsuwan-Atomu (Iron-armed Atomu, better known in the West as Astroboy).    The question that was posed in the reddit thread linked above by r/ElSquibbonator defined a ""battle shounen"" as this:  >   The main character aspires to be the best at a certain skill, which despite the name of the genre does not have to be combat-related (*Food Wars,* for example, is about cooking).  >There is some kind of hierarchy involved in this skill, and the main character will face recurring rivals who have the same goal.  >The villains appear in order of escalating evil, with the most threatening ones not entering the story until the climax.  >There is usually a heavy emphasis on the fights themselves, with one-on-one clashes between characters often taking up entire episodes.  >A distinction is often made between the protagonist's rivals and the actual villains, with the former usually being ""reformed"" after the protagonist defeats them.  >The protagonist usually has an excitable, enthusiastic personality, often contrasted with a more level-headed and calculating rival.  Astroboy definitely fits this bill.  The main character Atomu has an entire story arc called ""The World's Strongest Robot"" where Atomu goes to try to become the strongest robot in the world.  Many of the stories involve Atomu fighting major one on one fights against various rival villain robots (many of whom turn out to be sympathetic--another Shounen Trope)  [  The World's Strongest Robot arc definitely fits the ""true antagonist reveals himself"" trope, which also appears in other Astroboy arcs (FYI--""Pluto"" was a modern remake/reimagining of the World's Strongest Robot Arc for Astroboy as a detective/suspense story instead of a more traditional shounen battle story)  The ""true evil"" characters (usually humans) are often distinguished from the robots that are forced to fight Atomu.  And Atomu is absolutely the excitable, enthusiastic, very innocent personality, a contrast Astroboy draws with more cynical or resigned rivals in different arcs.  The original manga by Tezuka Osamu (who also made the anime adaptation) is tremendously influential in both anime and in manga, inspiring generations of Japanese artists.  It's debatable if Atomu should be credited as the originator of the Shounen battle genre.  Some manga historians credit ""Igaguri-kun"" by Fukui Eiichi, which began its run in 1952 a few months before Astroboy as the ""true"" first shounen action manga.    [  it features a similarly innocent and forthright protagonist in a Judo competition based martial arts manga, arguably the first sports-shounen as well.  The details of whether to credit Igaguri-kun vs. Atomu gets into the weeds a bit (and also Igaguri-kun wasn't adapted into an anime making it less relevant to this sub).  When it comes to the shounen genre in anime, I think it's hard to argue against Atomu being basically tied for first, and far and away the most influential.  But my point being:  If you're looking at the 80s as a starting point for the origins of Shounen or Shoujo works influences, you're starting waaaaaay too late in the process.  The manga origins of most modern genres have their roots in the 1950s or 1960s.  Tezuka Osamu's massive footprint on both Shounen and Shoujo genres, Shirato Sanpei and the Gekiga-movement of more realistic manga art and historical manga, Umezu Kazuo as the ""father"" of horror manga from the 1960s, etc. etc.  The anime of the 1970s and 80s are really the ""2nd generation"" anime/manga that were drawing inspiration from the 1st generation works of the 50s and 60s.",anime,1kec82y

"MAPPA Production Lines Speculation With the Zombieland Saga movie staff list now revealed, I thought it’d be a good time to put together a list of MAPPA’s animation producers and their current projects, similar to the lists I made for[ CloverWorks ]( [A-1]( To keep it from getting too bloated, I’m only including projects from 2020 onwards, so I'm leaving out small projects like MVs and commercials.  First, it’s worth mentioning that two of MAPPA’s animation producers have left the company over the past few years:  * [**Fuuko Noda**]( **(野田楓子)** → Dorohedoro → Twittering Birds Never Fly – The Clouds Gather → Mr. Love: Queen's Choice → The Gymnastics Samurai → Idaten Deities → Maboroshi → The Rose of Versailles    * She left MAPPA last year and joined Chocolate Inc., where she's currently working on their Killtube film project. * [**Tooru Kubo**]( **(久保亨)** → Uchitama?! Have You Seen My Tama → The God of High School    * He left MAPPA in 2021 and joined Sunghoo Park's E&H Entertainment  Now for their current animation producers:  * [**Keisuke Seshimo** ]( →  Jujutsu Kaisen →  Jujutsu Kaisen 0 →  Chainsaw Man →  Jujutsu Kaisen S2 →  Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc Movie\* →  Jujutsu Kaisen S3\* * [**Wataru Kawagoe**]( **(川越恒)** →  The God of High School →  Takt op.

And there's [**Ryota Kitsunai**]( **(橘内諒太)** who worked alongside Noda on Maboroshi, but since then seems to have shifted from production to directing, as he’s only been credited as an episode director recently.  For projects marked with an asterisk (\*), the animation producer hasn’t been officially confirmed yet, so there’s a chance they might end up being handled by someone else.  I will try to make something like this for other studios if I find the time.",anime,1kas3dz

I've always been intrigued when Anime does this with trying to present a character as being more heroic or virtuous than they are.   I think back to DBZ with Goku.

We will be covering one episode a day, with the final episode being on May 29th and a series discussion on May 30th. The schedule can be found [here](  ***  **Links/Information:**  [MAL]( | [AniList]( | [ANN]( | [Kitsu]( | [AniDB](  **Streams/How Do I Watch It?**  Alas, no legal streams for this one, you'll have to use alternative means.  ***  **Synopsis**  What is the most dangerous weapon in the world? I've got to assume most would name nuclear weapons. But what if it was our fellow human beings? A small portion of the population develops psychokinetic abilities known as Cantus. An individual with such power can move or create objects by merely thinking it. They can also commit violence and kill other people just as easily. A single person can kill thousands of people with no normal human being able to stop them. Needless to say, even with only a small percentage of humanity having such abilities it causes complete and utter chaos, and the collapse of what we'd consider modern civilization.  Shin Sekai Yori takes place in a rural village in Japan, a great many years afterwards. The show primarily focuses on a girl named Saki Watanabe and her classmates who have reached the age where Cantus powers start to emerge. Will Saki and her classmates be able to safely control their power? What secrets are their parents and teachers keeping from them? In a society where everyone has Cantus powers, what can be done to ensure one rogue person doesn't wipe out the entire village? The anime explores these and many other topics.

"Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit! Such a beautiful tale I started my journey in finding anime with sole female protagonists leads and I really loved this one a lot. Balsa is SO cool! I love it when I see women kick ass and act cool on top of it. It was also really sweet how motherly she was to Chagum, and I had around two scenes where I cried because of how emotional certain moments were.      I also like the detail how they made Balsa have some muscle to her, which is cool because if she's been traveling an training with her spear for so many years, of course she should have some muscle to her. it was also cool how they shown her to be really strong, but not overpowered enough where she's unbeatable, so it was nice to see her moments of weaknesses too.  Also, adult protagonists! In the anime she mentions she's almost turning 30, years old, which I feel is so appropriate (in terms of it making sense) since she's a hired bodyguard. It's always annoying when a character in anime does many adult activities and they suddenly go ""Hey, I'm 14!"" and I roll my eyes every single time an anime pulls that ridiculousness.  The pacing of the anime is pretty slow, it has its action moments, sad moments, and slice of life moments, so if anyone wants to watch it just enjoy it for what it is and take your time watching it too. I heard this anime is based on the novel and the anime only covered the first book, so sometime in the future I wish to read more of the novel.",anime,1kd126k

"Orb: On the Movements of the Earth and Anime of its Calibre Let me start by saying I recently finished this anime and was gobsmacked and awestruck by both its ambition in the grand view and its execution moment by moment. While certain segments were drawn out with philosophical dialogue that sometimes felt like the writer compromising the urgency of the fiction in favor of standing on a soap box, the soap box was so compelling that I didn’t mind. It may be that I’ve never seen an anime so involved in the celebration of knowledge and philosophy before, and, having now gone through it, it’s feeling tough watching most anything else.   For anyone else who enjoyed this anime, and felt it was a cut above its peers in the medium, what are you watching now? What have you enjoyed before?

"Help! I'm trying to find an anime 👀 Hi everyone, I've been trying to remember the name of an anime I watched between 2004–2009 through Anime Network On Demand, likely via Comcast or Time Warner in the U.S. It was dubbed in English and had a realistic tone and setting, likely from the late 90s or early 2000s   It had a realistic high school setting with a female protagonist caught in a serious love triangle. There’s a memorable scene where a boy talks about a candy that ‘tastes like a kiss’ and then kisses her by force. The art style was grounded and typical of the late 90s/early 2000s—no crazy hair colors or supernatural/sci-fi elements. It was dubbed in English and had a more serious tone.  I’ve ruled out quite a few titles already: Kare Kano, Peach Girl, Nana, Fruits Basket, Ao Haru Ride, Say “I Love You”, Your Lie in April, Horimiya, Boys Be…, Clannad, I""s Pure, D.N.Angel, Maison Ikkoku, Saikano, and Blue Drop.  Let me know if this rings a bell thanks  Edit: when she was in middle school she overheard her crush saying he didn't like her because she was ""boyish"" with her short hair. In high school however it's revealed he always liked her but was embarrassed. Now that another boy is showing interest and she's reciprocating he wants to come back in and get her.",anime,1kfgblb

Their singer Shu became the idol Shu✫Zo and leader of Trichronika, while their drummer Rom would eventually go on to found ShinganCrimsonZ. [They also had a guitarist Adam and a bassist Eve.](  Amatelast is not really a full-fledged band like the others in *Show by Rock!!*, it's just some character history that has been padded out a bit. They only have the one song, Cadenza, minimal official art, and not really any plot/lore except what relates to Shu✫Zo and Rom's pasts. Though Adam and Eve did actually appear and perform in the stage musical ―深淵のCrossAmbivalence―.   ----  ## New Songs!   Amatelast - [Cadenza](    ----  ## Bonus Songs  [04Tobizbits]( (04 Limited Sazabys) - [Warp](  [Shirorakurosuka?]( (A crow is white) - [fake!fake!](  Two more tie-up bands which won't appear in the anime, except for some minor background bits like their merch appearing on the shelves of Yaiba's shop today. Both of these bands are relatively minor bands that were added to the first game in 2015 with some plot episodes and a handful of songs, and they each performed at a few of the live concerts, but aside from that don't really appear anywhere else in the franchise. 04Tobizbits did eventually got added to the 2nd game, but with only 2 songs and a bit of art. Shirorakurosuka? (yes, the question mark is part of their name)'s real-life counterpart A crow is white disbanded in 2017 so they haven't had any involvement in the franchise after that.  ----  ## Question of the Day  [Q] What was the last time you got stuck with a big case of writer's block/artist block?    ----  ## Tomorrow's Question of the Day  [Q] >!Instead of an actual performance, for this episode's 'new song' they used a (partial) instrumental version of it more like an OST than a feature.

It is a haunting gem..visually stunning, emotionally rich..and a lot of times unsettling in the most poetic way possible. I cannot spoil it but I havent come across such animes in recent times. It is literally a gothic space poetry. Frames are very beautiful. We dont create these kind of animes any more.

"Transformers Superlink 20th Anniversary Rewatch interest thread [*Hi, my name is Neb, and I'm back to tell you about my Transformers rewatch!*](     ##What is ""Transformers Superlink""?     **Resources: | [MAL]( | [Anilist]( |  [Kitsu]( | [AniDB]( | [ANN]( |**   This entry is a ""sequel"" to Armada (Micron Densetsu), there are some references, but all relevant plot information is explained in Superlink, so you don't need to have seen Armada first. I do recommend it though, especially its Japanese dub Micron Densetsu, as it is an infinitely better show with some of the best characterization out of the entire franchise.  Transformers Superlink follows a new maincharacter, living on earth. Humanity has discovered Energon, a new source of clean energy. But this discovery might bring more trouble with it than it is worth..     ### Why should one watch it?     ~~We have Tekkaman Blade at home~~ Intentional or not, the show shares quite a few similarities with Tekkaman Blade. Tekkaman fans might find interest here spotting them, or making fun of it.  Studio Actas returns for one final time to animate Transformers, this time in CG, after no doubt getting fed up with Hasbro's meddling in the production of Armada.    The show makes for a neat comparison point to GuP and how far the studio has come with blending hand drawn art and CG.    For the Japanese dub. Just like Armada, the Energon dub team had to work with incomplete notes and whatnot, leading to some, or a lot, mostly a lot of nonsensical dialogue. Returning fans might find new interest watching the show in a new language with the dialogue actually making some sense!   The soundtrack. Quite possibly the dootiest soundtrack out there. I don't think it quite reaches the heights of Armada's music, but what it lacks in variety, its makes up for in *DOOT*. Pokémon gen III enjoyers are likely to have a good time.   Trumpet haters not welcome. (Unless you intend to leave funny comments detailing your hate of trumpets)  * The music is composed by [Kazunori Maruyama]( he hasn't worked on many animes, but he has composed the music for [Kamen Rider Ruyki]( and Super sentai Goseija among other things.        ###What to expect:     Trainwreck. With multi track drifting. I'm not gonna try to trick you, the show is.. not particularly good. Its not *the* worst Transformers show out there, but whenever that discussion pops up, well.. so does Energon.  And what better time to host a trainwreck rewatch than alongside another one! Hopefully.  That said, the show does have some interesting ideas here and there that I haven't really seen other shows do.    And it is at times just straight up fun, otherwise I wouldn't even be bothering.   For the rewatch threads themselves: featured sountracks of the day and episode polls will be making a return.   ###Schedule:    The rewatch would be following a biweekly schedule, with threads going up on Tuesdays and Fridays. For now, the initial starting date is planned on June 3, 2025.    * Post time is subject to change according to feeback, for now:  22:00 GMT/UTC, 23:00 CET, 17:00 EST, 14:00 PST, 03:30 IST, 07:00 JST.   ^^If ^^you ^^find ^^your ^^timezone ^^of ^^choice ^^is ^^missing, ^^it ^^was ^^deleted      ###Sub or dub?     For this watch I am recommending sticking with the Sub for the more coherent dialogue, but I will not stop anyone from attempting to suffer through the dub, after all the performances by David Kaye as Megatron, and Garry Chalk as Optimus are quite iconic.  - Availability: I believe TubiTV is streaming the English Dub(?) in the US.

[**Ninjinriot**](  A time-travelling high-tech band of ninjas that came to the present to search for a magical ninja scroll macguffin. As competent as that makes them sound, they are also prone to making clumsy mistakes and getting distracted from their mission by interesting aspects of the modern world like convenience store snacks.  This is the band that got attacked by a dark monster back in episode 5 which Cyan tried but failed to intercept.  Musically they're an electro-rock band with their dogboy leader Arashi as their sole vocalist. He's performed by Naoya Hirose, who is one of the most fascinating hirings in SB69: Hirose is not a voice actor, nor an established singer from a particular J-Pop band or music unit. He's mainly an improv theatre actor who does some freelance singing work on the side. I am *so* curious about how that selection happened.  An extra fun bit of trivia: So the *Show by Rock!!* stage musicals are very men-focused. They're all performed by male-only theatre companies, and each of the nine bands that have appeared in the musicals are male-only bands... except Ninjinriot. It's the only mixed-gender band to appear in any of the stage musicals. Which means we got Kensuke Takahashi playing the part of Rin the fox lady cyber-ninja [and he totally rocked it](   &nbsp;  [**BUD VIRGIN LOGIC**](  A mysterious band of young girls that I probably shouldn't say much about just yet, but yes if you couldn't already tell by all the German words in their song they might be almost as chūni as ShinganCrimsonZ.  Their music is a mix of symphonic/gothic metal and emo ballads. Their leader [.] >!Ailane!< is their only main singer, voiced by Ruriko Noguchi (who is a relatively minor voice actor but does singing roles in a lot of game/anime/etc projects like Uma Musume, Project SEKAI, Extreme Hearts, Beatcats), but [.] >!Pepain!< (Aimi Tanaka) and [.] >!Hundreko!< (Ibuki Kido) do some backup vocals and have one duet song.   ----  ## New Songs!

"I love Nana. Recommendations??? I don’t watch much anime in general, but I recently finished watching Nana and I absolutely loved it. The emotional weight, the way the story came together, the characters and their own individual conflicts and how their internal dramas affect others around them, etc.  I strongly dislike a lot of popular anime: the ones with loads of mindless fight scenes, the weirdly sex-obsessed ones, the ones with loads and loads of juvenile humor, etc. I want to see more stuff like Nana! That is to say, human, mature, grounded, and impactful. So please, what other anime would you guys recommend?  (I did also enjoy Attack on Titan, Death Note, and Polar Bear Cafe, if that helps at all)  Thank you!  PS—I found the Shin/Reira subplot really upsetting. He’s a teenager!!!

"Let's say I was an extremely rich Japanese Oligarch, and also a disgusting weeb at the same time. Could I brute force the production of an Anime by offering unlimited budget? Let's just say. And I really really wanted a No Game No Life Season 2 (or Overlord S5, and S6 etc etc) And money was no issue. I waltzed into Kadokawa's top brass, and made them agree to immediately start production of whatever sequel I desired. And also remove the human limitations (X studio was full capacity working on other stuff when I made the move? Magic they get double the human resources without diminishing quality. The author/sensei behind the IP is sick or busy? Boom assume they're as healthy as a horse and not busy).  Would it guarantee the production of the anime?    (Reason why I asked this was I just realized it had been 7 years between Overlord Season 3 and 4. And 10 for Devil is a part timer). I don't think I'm ready for another 10 years when they're sitting on so much material from the light novels.  So I was wondering, if Demand was all that was required to greenlight an anime. How much faster would we get sequels. For them to be fucking sitting on their asses.",anime,1gsn3qf

"Just finished season 1 of Mushoku Tensei after being somewhat critical of it in the past and boy was I stupid to wait this long. I’d watched two episodes back around the time it aired and it didn’t really click with me. Ended up moving on and as I got more involved in the anime community I saw the incredible amount of controversy with the series, mostly about Rudy. Thought I made the right choice dropping it and moved on.   Fast forward to now, Frieren has left a fantasy shaped whole in my heart, and Slime just wasn’t filling it. Kept seeing the buzz around MT season 2 and figured why not give it another shot. By episode 3 or 4 I was so upset that I didn’t watch this sooner. The show was so good that I immediately felt sad that I wasn’t watching season 2 with everyone.   There’s so much I loved about season 1 but my favourite thing has to be the character development Eris goes through.[Mushoku Tensei S1] >!The Eris you meet in her intro is completely different than the Eris that gets teleported. Then by the time they return home, she’s unrecognizable from the Eris she was.!<  Anyway if you’re on the fence like I was I suggest giving it a go, it’s become one of my favourite anime.",anime,1dtn4za

"Bleach has maybe the best comeback ever in the medium of anime Bleach alongside Naruto and One Piece were the defining Battle Shonens of the 2000s owing to their massive popularity and how lengthy their runs were. However while Naruto got a chance to complete its entire run by adapting the entire manga and One Piece is still running to this day, the anime adaptation of Bleach was cut short in 2012 with no promise of it ever continuing and adapting the final arc of the series.  From 2012 to 2022 we had series like Attack on Titan, One Punch Man, My Hero Academia, Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen become the defining action anime of the medium while Bleach seems to get more and more forgotten by the general audience. The only people still holding on to it were a passionate fanbase who still believed in the series enough to be hopeful that it will get a continuation even though the manga had ended so long ago.   And in 2022 Bleach finally returned after a decade and it has been a glorious comeback. It has gotten the top tier animation given to modern Shonen like Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen, completely ditched the slow pacing and abundance of fillers that plagued battle Shonen in the 2000s. Its influence can be easily seen on Black Clover, Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen. It has truly proven itself to be worthy of one of the pillars that together with Naruto and One Piece were known as the Big Three of the anime.",anime,1fwx0xu

"Ninja kamui fell off harder than any anime in years The first 4 episodes are decent with good fast paced action and clean animation, but as soon as they introduced the terrible cgi mec suits this show went down hill so fast. The fights went from good to almost unwatchable and the story was not interesting enough to keep me watching. Does anyone else feel this way or is it just me?",anime,1cq8uub
"I am so happy I decided to watch Delicious in Dungeon. I almost skipped out on it while planning my winter watchlist but decided I probably should add it given how many people had it on their plan to watch list on MAL. And that was such a good idea.  Every part of this show is great. Characters with good chemistry, evolving story, a creative and well thought out world, clean animation, and I WANT TO EAT THE FOOD SO BAD. I'm desperately hoping this clears for a season 2, maybe more than any show I'm watching right now. I know it's a short-ish manga, I bet two seasons would be all it would need, so please no for a Bloom Into You situation...  Also canon my ass, Farcille for life",anime,1condvu

"Trying to remember an old anime/cartoon with animal kung fu masters — watched it on TV as a kid Hey folks, I’m trying to identify an anime or cartoon I used to watch on television as a child (probably in the early 2000s). The show followed a main character on a journey to learn different kung fu techniques. Along the way, he meets around 12 masters—each one specialized in a unique kung fu style and was secretly an animal in disguise.  Some of the animals I clearly remember include a chicken, a panda, and a turtle. The tone was adventurous and had a martial arts theme throughout. I think each master taught him a new skill, and they may have been based on zodiac animals or something similar.  It was definitely dubbed in English (or possibly Hindi) when I watched it in India on TV. I can’t remember the name or exact plot details, but the concept of learning kung fu from animal masters really stuck with me.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?

Things like fan service, creepy tropes, and stuff that can definitely be ... off putting for newcomers. I get it, there's a lot of stuff we veteran anime fans have just gotten used to.

"I beg for help!! 😭 Hey everyone, I read a manhwa a couple of years ago and I’ve been trying to remember its name ever since. It’s been driving me crazy! I’ll list everything I remember in detail – if anyone recognizes it, please help me out!   ---  Basic Plot:  The main character (MC) is a very unlucky and pathetic guy who gets beaten up by women for the smallest misunderstandings. For example, if he accidentally touches someone on the train, they beat him up without question.  He covers his chest with both hands when riding the train to avoid accidental contact.  Every day is a struggle – he's either beaten by machines, girls, or misunderstood in class.  One day, he meets a strange, older guy living on the school rooftop. This guy is poor but oddly skilled at attracting women.  MC asks this rooftop guy to teach him how to “rizz” girls (though “rizz” isn’t the word used back then, the idea is that).  Rooftop guy teaches him tricks to become more appealing to women.    ---  Key Events/Scenes:  MC sees rooftop guy at an airport, where he flirts with an air hostess using a blade of grass, places it in her hair, flirts confidently, and then rejects her—this impresses the MC.",anime,1kp1afx

Would you prefer we keep Wareta Ringo the rest of the way, or switch to something else?  5) Back in episode 2 our narrator had a line about how if Maria had never been born, an untold amount of people's lives would have been spared. What is your theory on why this is the case?  6) What are your thoughts on the overall position of Kamisu 66 leadership, namely that they are willing to end the lives of children who pose any threat whatsoever to becoming a fiend or a karma demon in order to try and prevent the untold amount of deaths that they could cause? If in the same position, would you have taken a different strategy?  7) Predictions for where things go from here?  **Tomorrow's Questions of the Day**  I will post these via a separate comment after watching the next episode.",anime,1kp4gp1

"Question about Ragna Crimson and the tone of the series after episode 3. Hi, I just finished chapter 3, and I found it very disappointing. It was basically Crimson's monologue, where he kept talking nonstop, and at the end, there's the famous part of one of the dragons' accelerated monologue that was deliberately cut for comedy. My question is whether the series is going to be like this from now on, or will the fights start right away? I'm afraid of those touches of comedy, considering how bleak the human landscape is and how that contrasts with any attempt at humor. I'm also concerned about Crimson's constantly talking and annoying character, as is his minion, who seems to be made of water. Was the third episode a one-off and will the series become darker and more serious?",anime,1kp3ns6
"Hello everyone, please help me find an anime! I remember there was a ghost boy (or a boy like Yōkai or similar) who had a ghost(or kinda Yōkai again) sister. They encountered some woman who could see them (unlike other ppl) and they asked her to help them with calming evil spirits of local urban legends. The woman even pretended to be a school-girl to blend in with the crowd of students and find out about some disturbing mystical stuff happening in school to help students with it. Also, one of the villains was woman with cat ears (sort of pink hair, but it could also be yellow) and cat powers and habits. She also had a cat spirit companion. The ghost boy seemed to be in love with woman who helps him and his sister (actually this boy is very old as a ghost and it seemed he wanted to get back to life and probably get an adult body¿¿).",anime,1kp3mg9
"Can you recommend a great anime? Hi I like anime but in I can't find any anime I can watch more than one episode. I like FMA brotherhood, code geass, violet evergarden, attack on Titan season one and three, the first half of death note. I don't like any thing that has inappropriate content like in magi. Or the protagonist behaviour in that anime. Note: I am currently watching cowboy bebop and frieren. Note: I also don't like the anime of solo leveling but like the web comic.",anime,1kp3grv
"What action/shounen anime should i Watch based on the ones i watched These are the ones i watched:  •	⁠Fire force •	⁠Attack on titan  •	⁠Solo leveling  •	⁠Fate series  •	⁠Shangri La frontier  •	⁠Wistoria  •	⁠Demon slayer  •	⁠Jujutsu kaisen  •	⁠Kaiju n8  •	⁠Hunter x Hunter  •	⁠Sword art online  •	⁠Hells paradise  •	⁠Chainsaw man  •	⁠OPM  •	⁠Jojo  •	⁠Akame ga kill  •	⁠Bleach TYBW I know some have mixed genres but basically i want an anime that has good animation, fights and just original powers and designs. I dont care that much about the plot(its ok if its good, but not a must).  Maybe i missed some so i’ll reply to say if i watched one of the recommendations. Also, i dont like the action/isekai/ harem type anime like arifureta or danmachi, and i prefer it to be semi modern (From 2005 onwards, more or less).",anime,1kp3czr
"Where to go next? Hey everyone, Im somewhat new to anime i watched the classics growing up like Akira, Ninja Scroll, Ghost in a Shell and loved them. A few years ago I came across Dorohedoro and absolutely loved it. Then Chainsaw Man came along and I've been checking things out here and there since. Most of what I've loved so far was extremely short (except AOT) like Ninja Scroll series, Jujutsu Kaisen, One Punch man, Berserk, DanDaDan. Looking for similar suggestions where to go next? Im aware of Bleach, Full Metal, and Samurai Champloo which one of these would you all suggest first? Are there hidden gems you all would recommend? I tend to enjoy the darker stuff monsters, curses, demons or things straight up weird... Appreciate it!!",anime,1kp2j6l
"New anime for newbie girlfriend Hi! I made a deal with my girlfriend: if I watch all of her favorite Barbie movies(wish me good luck), she’ll watch one anime with me. So now I need help choosing the one anime that could get her hooked and make her want to watch more. She’s more of a Disney princess type — not really into anything super action-packed or war-themed — but I’d still like it to have at least a bit of classic anime-style fighting. It should definitely be cute, but preferably not slice of life, since those tend to be a bit too slow",anime,1kp21p2

"Do any of u know this kind of anime? Does anyone recognize this anime?  It’s probably school life, but I’m not sure if the scene was from the guy’s memory or a dream. Here’s what I remember:  A girl — maybe a classmate or neighbor — is at this guy’s house. The house is dusty, dirty, and neglected. The guy says something like, “My parents are out working and aren’t usually home.” The girl looks around, shocked by the dust, and asks, “When was the last time you saw them?”  He gets speechless or says something like “I don’t know,” looking pretty depressed.  It’s an old anime I watched years ago, and this scene really stuck with me.  Any ideas what anime this could be? Thanks in advance!  Also the story might not be exactly accurate because i vaguely remember it.",anime,1kphva0

In general i prefer animes with let's say ""more serious tone"" and shows that are geared towards adults. I like if they have political, drama and action elements in them.

"What Anime Fight is This? This is a long shot, but I need help finding an awesome anime fight scene I saw on Facebook like a month ago and I know I don't remember specific enough information for a chatbot to help me. But there are 13.5 million other nerds in this subreddit so I know one of you will be able to help me.  First, it's not from an ultra well-known anime that most people would know on sight like One Punch Man or Jujutsu Kaisan. The fight was between 2 guys, ages maybe one in their mid 20's and one in their late 30's (real rough guesses). The most notable part of it was very clearly the choreography. The animation was also good though. Most of it was straight up kinetic punching and kicking and jumping around with little regard to physics, it all felt very weighty and fluid. Also definitely some punching through pillars and whatnot. I do remember there were a couple brief moments of something supernatural going on. One of those things being... I think... Some sort of small doll thing that was watching them or maybe helping one of them in some small way at one point? The most distinguishable thing I remember that would identify it is the setting and a specific part of the fight scene. The fight takes place mostly entirely inside of a building that looks like a cross between a parking garage and a storage space for construction materials. But specifically there was a part where they jumped up into the rafters and fought up there, one of them getting up there by jumping off a ladder (in one of the more egregious displays of physics being defied in the fight scene). The whole fight scene was probably around 2 1/2 minutes long.  I know this description is extremely vague and poor. But that's why I'm here, hopefully the rafters part and the doll thing is enough for someone to identify it 🙏",anime,1kpazek

One person being equal to 800? Mild spoilers for one piece egghead and Attack on Titan season 4 I have seen it twice now and I'm wondering if there are any other animes with a scene referencing 1 person being equal to 800? Gabi in AOT wasn't worth 800 eldian soldiers and that's why she was sent out. Coby in OP was worth 800 soldiers as a hostage. Is there a reason why 800 solders seems to be a theme or am I crazy for this? It's probably a coincidence but I thought I'd ask.,anime,1kpbnva

So I was hoping maybe somebody here might help me find it, or maybe knows exactly what anime I mean by the description I am about to give. I'm slowly beginning to think I might just have dreamt the series...:  - A bunch of floating islands, that sometimes float pretty close to eachother, allowing for momentary boarding. - Very sunny setting, lots of geen. The main character's village is like a small farming haven, super cozy and nice. - Main character is some guy who either is the historian or is helping the village historian with scrolls, by writing down things that happen on a daily basis. He desires to know more about the world. - Main character gets a chanve to visiy another island to study some ruins, (I think he was placed there against his will,) meets some girl there who is magical and can fight. Mysterious, doesn't want to reveal who she is, (I think she is revealed to be a princess later?) - The main character's village is slowly facing ration problems. - The village islands is discovered to have some  dark secret hidden within it. Only elders know about it, and want to make sure no one else knows. - At some point in the story, we find out that there is a massive nation out there, the one the magical girl is from, that wants to conquer everything.",anime,1kiyw96
"How many people here really know about Malty? You all know this face. Every time someone here makes a post about *‘Which of these anime characters would you like to field dress with a spatula’* Malty is almost guaranteed to be on the list. But I have to ask, how many people here REALLY know that much about this character?    In Shield Hero, Malty S. Melromarc is overly hated in a clear case of internalized misogyny from both the creator and a majority of the fans. She's one of the best worst examples of the dangerously high levels of contempt that is given towards female villains. She's reviled for her actions, yet characters like Joker, Homelander, and Walter White do FAR worse things and have legions of fans who will justify or even defend their actions until they’re blue in the face. Some people will even say that they’re actually the good guys, and every other character is just holding them back from saving the world.  In a world with villains who have confusing and ever-changing motives, Malty remains very simple in what her goals are and what she wants to accomplish. In short, Malty’s goal is to become queen. And she’s willing to claim the throne by any means necessary.  *Why does she want to be queen so bad you may ask?*  Because becoming queen is the only way she can escape being raped/torture to death!  *Why would that happen to her you may ask?*  Because her own mother, the current queen, sold her as a political sex toy to a serial killing, rapist, pedophile when she was just 10 years old, solely so mom could enjoy a big fat political/financial/economical bonus. She was going to sell her daughter to The Ping King, who is in charge of the most advanced Kingdom in the land called Faubrey. Literally his kingdom is far advanced, it has cars, planes, guns, and hospitals. Needless to say, many other nations want to be a part of his table. So, he demands that the other kingdoms have their women sent to him as 'toys' to rape and torture them until they’re just a puddle of gristle and fat on the floor. Then he heals them back to 100% with magic just to start all over again. This can go on for weeks or even months, until he gets bored and demands a new toy.  The main hero Naofumi is fully aware of what will happen to her and what has happened to the other few thousand women that have been sent there. Because they send royal women there as a form of political execution. Literally 9,999 other women were raped/tortured to death and it's highly disturbing how none of the heroes seem too torn up about this, and how the Queen wants to be allies with this monster of a man.  Not too many casual anime fans know this, because they bowed out after the first season. This has created a common misconception that everything Malty does as a villain is just for goofs and giggles. Nothing could be further from the truth. However, this is not a deep or well-kept secret either, with most fans of the franchise being fully aware of this fact. In fact, most of the fans want to see this happen to the extent where they want it to be put in the anime adaptation. Essentially it would be an animated snuff film.  Everything Malty did was to try and avoid this fate. Yes, even betraying Naofumi. That was her essentially doing a political move. Malty is a princess in a country that hates the shield hero. The most powerful entity in her kingdom, besides the royal family, is the 3 heroes church who also hate the heroes. She used this as an opportunity to earn a favor from the church, so they’d help her become the queen. And becoming queen is the only way she would be safe from being sent to the Death Rape Pain Factory.  *But why didn’t she join up with them instead of betraying them you may ask?*  Even if she did saddle up with all four heroes, it wouldn't have helped at all. On top of most of them being morons that were too busy adding underage slave girls to their harem, they were going to be sent back home once the Waves had been dealt with, so she would have been back to square one. Call it a hunch but those fools probably wouldn't have much of a chance to stop the Pig King when they can barely control their own weapons and keep losing the ability to even have them! I wouldn't trust any of them to save a place in line for the shitters, let alone save me from a terrible fate!  It’s not me looking to deep into this either. In Vol 16 on the canon LN her mother confirms that she set it up a long time before the story started, claiming she wanted to save her country no matter what the cost. Even if it meant sending her daughter to a fate worse than death. Then her dying words are her blaming herself for everything Malty did, and being the reason behind all Malty's actions while her father also blames himself. They literally spell it out that it’s their fault for riving Malty to such extremes, and she was just trying to save herself.  The link below confirms this.  [  Don’t believe me? The creator was interviewed and flat out confirmed that the villains are based off of people they know in real life. Considering how the main female villain is raped to death, how much more obvious does it have to be that they’re getting off on this??  [  Look no further than the original web novel. Naofumi keeps her from committing suicide to make sure she is sent there. Read the WN chapter of her fate to someone unfamiliar with the story and see how hard it is explaining to them that this is supposed to be a good thing and how you're supposed to be cheering on the 'heroes' for letting her be sent to the worst fate that can befall a woman. (Note they refer to Malty as 'Witch' in this chapter, just to be extra mean)  [  But I've seen so many fans of this series defend Malty's fate, the entire concept of the Pig King and the titular 'hero' letting this happen until entire comment sections that look like hives of pro-rape supporters. I’ve even had people tell me they would have done the same thing.  What say you guys?",anime,1kjoewa

"I’m so annoyed anime shows end quickly I obviously know shows in anime normally follow manga , or events like budget and producers quitting end the show, I get it. What I’m saying is that I mainly watch anime honestly and theirs thousands and thousands of shows with only 12-24 episodes is so annoying. Especially the shows who only cover a little bit of the manga and theirs still 50+ chapters left. Like why isn’t it more normal to other companies to continue these shows if they have the budget ETC. I literally hate a good show ending because they only got 12 episodes and they refuse to make more. And also I hope we are not kept in the dark so much either. Like the show zom 100. That shit was fire but I thinks it’s been over a year and no news on season 2 like cmon.",anime,1kixocc

You know how we have Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, but they’re so general—what if there was something built just for the anime community? I am sure I am not the only fan that thought of that haha.  If a platform like that existed, what would you all love to see on it?  * Would you want specific features for sharing and discovering anime content? * Maybe some way to make finding anime events or trading merch easier? * Or are there other things you’d add to make it feel unique to anime fans?  I’d love to hear what your ideal anime platform would have. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I'm curious to see what would make a platform feel like home to the anime community!",anime,1g28gqv

"for anyone who is a fan, are all the strawhat guys peepers? (I know horniness is a trope you gotta except with shonen, but sometimes it feels more prominent in OP then other animes) I've found myself feeling disappointed with how namely Usopp and Franky have been treated occasionally up till where I am (ep 330ish.) for characters that are meant to be objectively horny, like Sanji or brook {would find him a bit more likeable if he wasn't the panty peeper he is (from literally the one time I've seen him so far} but oh well, if that's PART of his character.) but there have been a couple things from Franky and Usopp, while aren't big, have disappointed me slightly and make me wonder if my views on them as characters are supposed to change, or if everybody in the one piece world are horny peepers.  like i know hormones exist, and i hope i don't sound like I'm tweaking out meaninglessly over this, but here is a example that makes me unsure whether to question the character themselves, or the world at large (as in ""this is meant to be normal, and does not reflect on this char at all"")  chopper (in manga) picks up the panel in thriller bark, hogbacks mansion saying he has no inclination to see human girls naked, but what he DOES want to peep in on is DR hogback's office.  whether this implies that he possibly WOULD want to peep in on whatever he does find attractive,\* and if so, does that mean that boys who are japanese, irl, dream about peeping in on women, or actually do it, as a norm? its these things that make me wonder.  (\*\*\*btw yes, I've seen a picture or 2, of what i can only assume, is him being smitten by some hot ferret lady when doing searches, please don't say anything that could regard to that, as I'm not there yet and want to witness this myself lol\*\*\*)  idk if this was an out of context conversation Ussop and him where having, (though I doubt it, based on the fact there was nothing before this,) or this was a normal thing to say, as in, until I where to say so, me wanting to be a peeping tom is a totally normal assumption to make about me. (i mean obviously it was meant to officially quill questions about chopper, but i want to know why it was said the way it was.)  either way, its stuff like this that annoy me, because whether its Franky going ""noice!"" when a girl's clothes are getting ripped off in front of him, or Usopp peeping on Nami casually whether he has feelings for her or not, just make me feel confused, and like I have too look online at biased (usually American) opinions which defend and glaze or shame and are offended by Oda as a person, to get the information I want or find solace. |:c  whether this is supposed to be normal sexuality exhibited by them that is just not western-standard coded, all the strawhats are actually pervs (which I doubt is meant to be the case), or these being jokes that I've taken out of hand for their original purpose (not saying its any better if their jokes I just wanna know the meaning + get more information.)  I know Japan is different than here, and I'm not being one of those condoning this as a excuse for sexism, nor condemning one piece as I do love it, but I do want more information about what this was all intended as.  (and I do understand to take answers with a grain of salt because I know this sub, just like any other, will be biased.)",anime,1j93p8v
"I've started watching JJK (spoiler free, yay!) And I wanna voice my opinions! I love how funny it is. Nobara is one of my favourites. I love how pretty she is, she's just so eye popping yk? And I love gojo, well, i more so like his personality. It has so much flavour! also geto? Hello? Look at him! That man is a asshole but omg he's so cool! Actually, all of them are so cool. I cant wait to watch season 2! I'll straighten my back for that definitely. Ive also seen this guy floating around called 'Toji' i think? He seems so cool and I cant wait to see how makes their lives even better (somehow). Toji looks incredibly badass, granted I know nothing about him. For all i know, he could be the weakest person in anime history. But thats just my thoughts! I love this show so far and I cant wait to see how much more intriguing it gets! I hope nothing goes wrong and these characters enjoy life like they are :)  (im hoping I dont jinx it. Im growing too attached)",anime,1fh65qm
"Naruto is Trash, HxH better James 1        Lebron James        Professor Jordan        English 258        March 17th, 2024        Why Naruto is Trash    Kurapika was made before Sasuke, buddy, and Sasuke is trash in every way compared to this guy. Getting revenge yet fails in every way cause Itachi had to kill himself, and he was whooping his ass, and he was sick at the time and going blind as well. Then he wanted to get revenge on the village; then he wanted to capture the eight tails, then he wanted to kill Danzo, then he wanted to do this, then he wanted to do that, then protect the village, and become the one above all like cmon this mother fucker was all over the place, it's a joke. They tried too hard to make it look like Naruto and Sasuke were good friends at the beginning of the series, but in reality, they hated each other; of course, they were going to be close because they were coworkers, but they weren't good friends at all. It took a whole series called Shippident to get this man back to the friend group, and these people act as if he was a good friend; no, he'll no, he tried to kill Naruto multiple times but failed in every single way the last fight en though naruto was holding back because he wanted to save Sasuke and had less than 50% of Kurama's Chakra in top of that he used sn insane amount of Chakra before the fight cause he was using the Chakra mode the whole war. Sasuke even had to steal the Chakra from the nine tail beasts to try to kill this guy, yet still failed. It's a joke. Naruto slams Sasuke in every single way, and the fact that he never gave up on him when in reality nobody would even go that far goes to show how garbage the show is, with a bunch of plot holes and plot convinces, like cmon, how did they get 10000 ninjas out of nowhere for the war since only 12 ninjas graduate every year. Obito could have stolen Naruto for the nine tails at any time before he had the chance to get strong and only waited until he reached his peak just to declare war on everyone, like, huh!? You and what army, lil bro. The explanation is that the Uchiha Clan incident only happened because the Uchiha wanted to revolt against the leaf. After all, the third Hokage and Danzo mistreated them. It reached a critical point because Obito used Sharingan to attack the village. Hence, the Hokage had to move the Uchihas to outside the village because of it, yet many Uchihas died during the entails incident; it just doesn't make sense, and they feel as if the Uchihas are a threat to the whole village while the village in the sound wasn't like wtf. And moving on, god was Itachi, a horrible brother, yet everyone glazed him, anything wrong that you could imagine, traumatized him, forced him to watch his parents' death over 100 times, abandoned him, and proceeded to somehow set him up for failure after death because he should have known better about tobi, and just a sweet goodbye while giving him his flashback with a smile of his fave and that's it, it's just horrible, he was never there for him, amplified his trauma when his brother was 12 years old, and overall was a failure in every single way, hell he even stated that he was planning to use seizures eye to brainwash Sasuke into not opposin8ng his village out of his own will so you can easily say he is horrendous. And Sasuke spamming the sane nine tails Chakra through the entire series with no consequence was just too goddamn awful, but quite frankly impressive fact that this beast that has been around for over a thousand years would be willing to comply, just help this kid in every way possible, like a mindless zombie and not giving a damn over the fact that he is just using you for power when you could get set free if he dies, is straight up diabolical, and besides that shadow clones, Rasengan, like naruto spams the same shit over and over again, he is a horrible fighter. And the whole power boost after they came back from the dead was an ass pull; it is plot convenience in every way; you shouldn't be able to transfer an insane amount of power out of thin air 1000 years after dying just because they are the reincarnations of your sons, like wtf, that whole shit was straight up a plot. Talk no jutsu; one quote I will always remember from Uncharted 4: a thief's End: ""You don't just dedicate your entire life to something and walk away empty-handed"" ass pull, obito would have never listened to Naruto; that talk no jury was ball shit. Naruto also tries to make this narrative about never giving up on your dreams, work hard and that shit never got touched upon; they tried so hard to make it an underdog story, yet Naruto always had everything given to him, nine tails, amazing teachers that were all in every single way somehow related to powerful figures, Kakashi: 6th Hokage, students of the 4th Hokage, Jiraiya, student of the 3rd Hokage, which was the student of the 1st snd 2nd Hokage, you see naruto pretty much made every single connection in the book except the 5th Hokage right off the start. The only hard-working underdogs in this series were none other than Rocket and Might Guy; for some reason, they were never rewarded for their hard work, effort, and determination; you can say it paid off cause Might Guy was able to stand against Madara with the sixth paths, but he proceeds to lose his leg and ability to walk. In contrast, on the other hand naruto was given his whole ass arm back, which shows that this series is horrible. And back to Hunter Hunter, the whole Naruto Part 1 was just ripping off Hunter Hunter, kurapika, Sasuke, Kurta Clan, Uchiha clan, Phantom Troupe, Akatsuki, Hunter Exams, chunin exams, Scarlett eyes, sharingan, 100 type Guanyin Borisana, 1000 hand wooden statue like cmon, you guys have to be blind to not see it. And overall, naruto is trash in every single way; I still didn't touch upon unbelievable shit like Shisui's suicide and the Akutsi not teaming up against the village as a team, and a bunch of other nonsense but all said and done, yeah, man, I hate Naruto and everyone that thinks that naruto is a good series if you are going to reply with something like r/wooosh, ration, L, r I'm not reading alot, you can suck on your mom's pussy because you would have to be straight up evil to do this to me.

"An opinion about anime What are your thoughts on the anime industry?  Many people I talk to are anime haters, but there are also anime lovers. As for Anime, I love to watch it, I'm almost a fan, for the entire time I watched almost 200 anime, of various genres. It doesn't matter to me, Hentai, Mystic, Romance, Yuri, Yaoi, I watch everything.   When I tell someone I love it, I get judged, why? Because they just don't like it? Most people who don't like anime simply haven't watched it, and don't even know what could be there.   This really annoys me, when I ask - ""You watched anime, that's why you didn't like it and you condemn it in response?"".  They answer me - ""I have never watched it and never will, it's disgusting.""   Seriously? People who judge anime, please LEARN what it is before you judge THIS",anime,1cuhg5n

Not to mention that the so called Gods were portrayed in a sexual and lustful way indulging mostly in sex  It’s not my first time coming across such a thing but the others were more respectful of the divine attributes of God, I wondered as I’m a Muslim I’d feel offended and take an action against this so I wanna know how do buddists and taoists people feel about it or they dont care or maybe that I’m not fully knowledgeable about that parts in their religion where this is acceptable",anime,1cvm72g
Masamune revenge why is it so bad? Okey so I just started watching this I’m sure like most people but first episode catches the view and makes him instantly deside whether anime is good or worthless trash if it’s not worth time and I’m on s1 ep3 and I can’t idk what the writer though but first episode turned me off he thinks he’s hot so he can get revenge but his mentality is still as the fat loser see that’s where a lot of revenge love anime fail they pic an mc u changed his body but that alone won’t make anything worth it u have to change the mind set cause in masamune the guys mind set is he’s still a pathetic loser changing look won’t matter if your mentality stays the same ugh dude is such a loser,anime,1cp0j7q
"My slightly organized thoughts and disappointment in Utena I just finished watching Utena the other night and have given it 24 hours to settle and ruminate in my mind. I am still deeply dissatisfied with the story and presentation of information, however and thought I would make a post that is open to discussion so I can process my feelings and try to see if fans can try to help me see what I am missing  Full Disclosure: I watched the entire show except a single recap episode around the start of season 2. I got the missing information I would have learned from it and moved on. I am open to watching the movie, but I have no time or interest in the manga. If something is explained better in the manga I would love to hear about it though. I’ll try to be as fair as I possibly can, stating when I think there is a good reason for something, but I am a story driven person and I am aware this is a more abstract, interpretive piece. I will try to focus my criticisms on things which are either problematic or story issues I think were sacrificed on the altar of metaphor. There is a wonderful story and theme at the core of this mess, and I am sad how I couldn’t see it fully realized.  1: AGE UP THE CHARACTERS PLEASE. Many talk about how Utena is a coming of age story, and about setting your child self aside so that your adult self can grow. I think that is wonderful, but these are young teenagers with Utena and Anthy both being 14! This is, frankly, horrifying. And their designs across all media do not code them properly as middle schoolers. This is a widespread problem across anime as a whole, but I think it is especially bad here considering the relationships both implied and shown on screen. By design, these characters look like juniors/seniors in high school at the youngest, and I think a better story would put them all in early college instead. It would better explain the lack of parents and general freedom they seem to have far better. This also puts them in a time when most people are trying to figure out who they are as adults. And yes, given the age of the target audience, I see why they chose the ages they did, but Snow White is canonically 14 and we all thought she was 30. Making this grand school a college campus works just as well if not better because then we can drop almost all of the child grooming allegations.  2: This is not an LGBT story; this is an incestuous one. I wanted to watch this as many still claim it to be the early days of gay rep in anime. I was curious and went in expecting lesbians and a fun take on subverting gender roles. And I got that… kinda. The idea that you are engaged to the Rose Bride is nothing but a bait to lure unsuspecting victims in. I can see how Utena and Anthy have a thing for one another, but I can see it more as a codependent toxic relationship between them. Gotta keep it vague in the 90s, but in total I counted 2.5 gay pairings, and 3 incestuous or implied incest. We have Utena/Anthy, Juri/Shiori, then half a point for Touga/Saionji. On the flip side we have Touga/Nanami, Akio/Anthy, and I am STRONGLY side eyeing Miki/Kaoru and Nanami/Mitsuru. (Mitsuru specifically for having a fantasy where Nanami loses her memory, and he pretends to be her big brother to win her affection.) This show cannot go 5 minutes without implying that a boy and a girl cannot be close without there being some kind of romantic tension between them. Especially if they are somehow related by blood. This is disgusting and, with the debatable exception of Akio/Anthy, does not serve the greater themes and metaphors in a truly meaningful way. If you cut all of it out and replaced it with… oh… I don’t know… a trippy dream sequence with imagery to help better show the story and character feelings… Maybe I would be less disturbed. Imagine if the entire subplot of Nanami pining for her brother was replaced with occasional wild dreams Anthy has about her past and her growing feelings as they come closer to opening the Rose Gate. Which brings me to my third point.  3. Lose Nanami. She’s the funniest character by far. She’s punished constantly by her ridiculous imagination and the extremes she goes to in nearly every situation. What a wonderful and lighthearted character to inject some levity into the show. Until anything remotely serious happens. I haven’t done a proper calculation, but about 9 episodes have at least a strong focus on her including the cowbell episode. (No one needed the cowbell episode.) When she is given so much more notable screen time compared to the others even on the student council, it hurts all the more that she can’t go five seconds without confessing her love and obsession to her big brother. A love that, as soon as she realizes they might not be blood related, she gives up on almost immediately. And then she proceeds to have the audacity to judge Amity for what is happening to her. Of all characters to find out and act with such revulsion, I think is laughable at best it would be her. Her words and actions by that point contradict one another far too much. I would again prefer that screen time be given to Anthy, Utena, or Akio, giving them time to properly develop as central characters.  4. Treatment of Anthy. I get it. The whole metaphor that women are tools used by men to boost their egos and “winning” a woman as a trophy instead of treating her like an actual person. It’s good, but my goodness did the treatment of her give me whiplash. One moment they’re having a normal conversation with her, then they slap her to the ground and treat her like a dog. And then they’re almost friends. She is both bullied and harassed by everyone, yet she is the most coveted girl in school. It’s such a strange way to portray it and I see similar tropes of “She’s beautiful and perfect and likeable in almost every way, but she is also BULLIED” used in edgy writing to this day. I have a feeling this is where the trope originated and for that I am almost ready to slap Anthy myself just for that. Some characters show slightly different ideas of how the Rose Bride should be treated, but I feel within the student council their feelings and treatment of Anthy could have been far more varied to tackle different angles of the same idea.  5. The Power To Revolutionize The World. This is said in every episode at least once or twice. And yet we get no clear explanation what exactly this might be or everyone’s true motivations for obtaining it. This is dragged out and done poorly. Utena as a character should have been asking more questions and even one or two well placed conversations would have gone a long way. Why not take a few minutes away from Nanami and instead ask every character what they truly want with that power? All of these kids are from insanely wealthy and prominent families (except for maybe Saionji who was acting like a fugitive when he was expelled), so what could they possibly want with more power? That is something that should have been answered by every duelist by the time of the Black Rose arc. By the final arc, I desperately craved a full and proper episode about the origins of Dios and the history of the Dueling contests. The play shown to us was very creative and did well to spell most of it out, but I still felt lost on why they had such an abnormally prolonged lifespan. Anthy and Akio being nonhuman is fine, but I spent so long pondering what and why very basic things were happening that the explanations we finally received were underwhelming at best. I know the goal is to focus less on the story and more on abstract imagery and symbolism, but I feel the show greatly suffers because I cannot focus on themes when I am still trying to puzzle out the basics of the story.     So that’s about it for my complaints. Turned more into a rant really, and I apologize for that, feelings are still fresh. I’m ready for whatever fire and brimstone y’all are gonna rain down on me, but I would still like to try and listen to what everyone has to say as I want to salvage the good aspects of this show in my mind.",anime,1cms6nw
"Anime Characters That Deserve Harems I want to start a respectable discussion between my fellow Cultured Individuals to nominate and share the characters whom you believe to be worthy of obtaining their own loving and addoring Harems. It doesn't matter who you choose to put forward, as long as they have endured MANY physical, mental, and emotional hardships during the course of their stories and Still came out Respectable and Likeable. I would Prefer you choose Main Characters, however if you find a supporting Character to be worthy of consideration (especially if they are from a series with a lackluster MC whom you Believe they deserve to replace) then by all means put them forward.  For example I myself believe that Naruto Uzumaki Deserves his own Harem, after all he endured just existing let alone growing up before he managed to pull the villagers heads out of their collective Ass's And all he endured Afterward all the way into his Adult years (Minus the blatant plotholes Kishimoto fucking Missed because he was too busy Trying to draw accurate Toes) that we know happened And that was hinted, he still came out respectable and Likeable, therefore I nominate Naruto Uzumaki! And for the opposite example, I believe that Sasuke Uchiha Does Not deserve his own Harem, he received preferential treatment before his family's death's and then afterward practically the entire village was sucking his dick, yet he still turned into a complete piece of shit, and after Naruto beat his ass the whole village forgave him, pardoned him, and got right back to sucking him off. Therefore I would rather SHOOT MYSELF than nominate Him.  Also I want to see your list of choices of the characters you Believe should be in the Harems of your choice Nominees, And who should not, And why.  I look farward to any further discussions!",anime,1fbqkxw

"Utena was not good, help me understand why it's so well loved. I will start off respectfully, but I am still stewing over Utena 2 months after watching it. Second worst anime I have ever finished, and I watch pretty low tier stuff regularly. I think they were too focused putting metaphors over story and put the spotlight on secondary characters over fleshing out their main characters. This combined with horrible pacing and some choice lines just left me far angier than I expected, even today.   Despite this, I am very much open to a discussion about why others might love this show so much. I understand if nostalgia plays a part in your feelings or the representation, but I want to be open and say I value story over metaphor and development of main characters over the entertainment value of the secondary cast.   So please: Tell me why you like Utena despite the poor pacing, horrible delivery of key information, and the flags redder than communist flag.",anime,1e29xc6

The first few episodes were definitely strange to say the least. But the unique concept immediately hooked me. Personally, I’m a pretty emotional person and this show definitely got me good quite a few times. Definitely an unexpectedly, highly enjoyable experience all the way through. Simply a very gripping concept with many plot twists in just 24 episodes. I definitely recommend this anime if you have Hulu.",anime,1dt6fox

"Demon Slayer story is at best 6/10 Look, i want to like Demon Slayer so bad, i love Tanjiro and Tomioka with my whole heart, but can we please have an honest conversation about the story and plot of Demon Slayer? I absolutely loved the first season and the Mugen Train. The characters were awesome, the art is beautiful, the story was paced pretty well. However, for me it has really fallen off since then. Season 2 was paced horribly IMHO, the characters were so mid, there has been next to no character development (Zenitsu has actually regressed as a character) and so much of the fight feels so utterly useless because it doesn't matter how many times Tanjiro summons every ounce of strength, doesn't matter how many times he says this is everything he's ALWAYS going to power up again. This led many episodes to me just completely pointless. We won't even talk about how Inoske survived because we was able to rearrange his guts at the last second. And season 3 from what I've seen is more of the same, it still offers no development for Zenitsu and Inoske, and is just all powering up and powering up again.

"ranting about ntr stuffs. Alright, let's talk about NTR (Netorare) anime/manga   Reality Check: Life has slapped me with ""you're not the one"" moments more times than I care to count. It taught me that good things don't always come my way.  in real life, there's a chance you may get girls but also there's a chance that  some dude might knock your girl so.. don't want to risk and don't want reward risking .  It's a harsh reality where nothing works like fantasy   Cultural Angle : Some Japanese creators might channel their own insecurities about not being able to satisfy their partners into NTR content. Japan is known for its politeness, and maybe this is some arthur way of expressing those fears. Or it could just be a trend, an easy way to make money by following what’s popular. To some, it's just a fantasy, but getting too detached from reality can lead to unrealistic expectations and so on ,  dissatisfaction with life outcomes.  Emotional Exhaustion: Maybe some people are so emotionally drained that only NTR scenes can stir and tinkle their hearts. But honestly, that's not a healthy way to cope.  The Regular Guy Perspective: I’m just a regular everyday mf, I'm single and  my hand is my only lover. I dream of a relationship where rules are respected and dedication is a given. An open relationship might just bring insecurity feelings and unnecessary drama. Sure, my future partner and I may have messy pasts, but once we're together, I hope we stick to our roles. If she cheats, well, then I chose the wrong one.  In a Nutshell, NTR is not for me. It messes with my head and doesn't align with the kind of relationship I want.

"Realised Death Note's premise is kinda dumb in hindsight The whole thing is about this genius boy trying to change our ""rotten world"" by killing all violent criminals. This seems to me like a very poor use of the Death Note, because violent crime isn't the cause of the bigger problems plaguing society, it's only an effect of them. If he really wanted to better the World, why didn't he go after corrupt politicians, oil business moguls, arms manufacturers, y'know, the people actually responsible for the things being the way they are? It becomes aggregious when there's this whole Arc where he gives the notebook to a scummy executive and I'm like ""there's the guy, kill him, he is the problem you were on about"" I think it makes sense for Light to have this very middle-class understanding of morality, but it is strange no one else brings it up, I believe someome like Rem, for instance, would be aware of this contradiction",anime,np6ieb
"My JoJo's Bizarre Adventure theory(ies) that is TECHNICALLY true in the given canon. So, first off...SPOILER ALERT to anyone who has not watched or read JJBA. I would give specific parts but it's pretty much the entire series. But specific parts are: Part 1 (Phantom Blood), Part 2 (Battle Tendencies), Part 3 (Stardust Crusaders), Part 4 (Diamond is Unbreakable), Part 5 (Golden Wind), and Part 7 (Steel Ball Run). Proceed at your own risk.   Second off, there was no ""Theory"" flair available, so I iust used the ""review"" flair since its KINDA the closest...?  Also, forgive me for not remembering years and dates and stuff like that. Its 2 am where I'm from and I have work, a quiz, and a party tomorrow so please cut me some slack here.   Everyone caught up? Good. Let's begin.   Theory 1: Joseph Joestar isn't the only Joestar to cheat on his wife.   We all know the loveable Joseph Joestar. The old man who spits out sharp lines, the guy who can accurately predict people's next lines, and the only member of the stardust crusaders to know the ancient ripple breathing technique, Hamon. However Joseph is also know for something else. He is the ""only"" JoJo in the long line of JoJo's to have cheated on their significant other after marriage. Sometime after his supposed funeral, he cheats on his wife, Suzie Q, with another woman to conceive the main character of JJBA Part 4, Josuke Higashikata. He gets a lot of hate for this.   However, if you look at it from a technical stand point, one other Joestar has done this. And it's not who you think.   Good ol' gentleman Jonathan Joestar had his life cut short in a boat explosion when he killed himself and long time rival/adoptive brother, Dio Brando. Dio took Jonathons body from the neck down and survived the explosion to be fished out of the ocean and going by the name DIO, using Jonathan's body and his own head. From this point on, what we see in part 3, he stays trying to end the Joestar bloodline, by trying to kill Joseph and Jotaro.   However, as we find out in Part 5 and 7, DIO got a little busy while in between what we see. He has some children with unnamed women which result in children like Giorno Giovanna, and Diego Brando. The latter of which eventually just going by Dio. Some of you may know where I'm going with this. Since the whole baby making parts are below the neck, Jonathan Joestar cheated on his beloved Erina after she died. Even though it wasnt his control, he did cheat. It is canonical that Giorno has both Joestar blood and Brando blood running through him, as revealed to us by Koichi in part 5 when he says he senses Joestar blood in him. Therefore, it was Jonathan's body which resulted in Giorno's birth. However, DIO does get some comeuppance.    Theory 2: DIO dies a virgin.   As previously stated, DIO takes over Jonathan's body prior to having kids. As I also stated before, the baby making process takes place below the neck. Therefore, Dio never used his own baby making parts and therefore dies a virgin when Jotaro split him open.     If there is anybody who has any other theories (I had some more, but I forgot what they were. Keep in mind, I'm seriously drowned in exhaustion and business.) feel free to chat in the comments, but PLEASE DO SO RESPECTFULLY AND KINDLY! Thank you.",anime,ivnfn1

One thing never stuck with me though, its ‘Save the Town’ ending.  It makes sense within the story, but it feels out of place in the flow of the movie. We’re used to seeing 2 lives from a 3rd person perspective, then we do a full 180 to a guerrilla-style vigilante affair to control the town’s communications and call evacuation.

"WHY I DON'T LIKE BORUTO the thing is i was not a boruto hater from start , tbh I was really excited for this series and after watching the first episode my expectations from boruto were high and I was really invested in it , but there were things that really changed my opinion for boruto.   1) POWER SCALING : power scaling in boruto is just stupid tbh , like boruto a 12 year old making two kage level jutsu ( compressed rasengan and wind rasengan ) in literally a week or so without use of shadow clones , just for reference , minato created a basic rasengan in 3 years , naruto created rasenshuriken in 4 and a half week using hundreds of shadowclones , and people often say ""omg boruto is a prodigy"" look we have had several prodigies in narutoverse , kakashi , itachi , minato etc but none of them created a kage level jutsu at 12 ( yeah kakashi created chidori but it wasn't said to be a kage level jutsu whereas creating a variation of rasengan is clearly stated to be a kage level feat ) then there is mitsuki , a 12 year old test tube baby with sage mode , like are you serious ? writers literally said "" hmm boruto's life is in danger , should me bring konohamaru his teacher to protect his students which would be very much acceptable as he is a join and people expect him to be strong or should we make boruto surpass his limits and protect himself and his friends in a heroic was , naaaaaaah let's give mitsuki sage mode , they would like it"" and the worst part is that these characters don't even use their powers anymore , they just used them once , and then konohamaru , grandson of 3rd hokage, a shinobi who wants to be a hokage himself and writers did him dirty , he only has 2 good fights in entire series and one of them only lasted around 20 seconds ( against jugo ) he didn't did anything against AO , he has no jutsu of his own , like just think how much more sense it would've made if compressed rasengan was konohamaru's jutsu and he teaches it to boruto , the thing is , boruto as an anime uses power as a very cheap way of making bad written characters likable.                                        2) ANIMATION : first episode , first scene , i saw the animation and i knew shit was serious , but as time passed by the quality of animation has gone down ( i am not talking about fight scenes , every shonen anime has to have great fight scenes and boruto has good battles but true animation quality is the one that stays consistent for most of the series ),and i am not expecting some ultra hd movie like animation , but at least good animation with smooth motion , specially nowadays the animation is just bad , and i guess the major reason for this is that boruto is a weekly airing anime , and what is the need for it , in a time where almost every anime is released in seasons what is the need for an weekly anime , cause when an anime is released in seasons the animation studio has time to plan for the next season , changes in story can be made , scenes and story is more well planned , there is less pressure on animators , this all results in better quality of animation . plus there are fillers that are not only unesessary but also add up to the total cost of making the anime . now , when boruto is competing with anime like jjk , demon slayer , black clover , my hero academia , one punch man etc animation is important  specially when you give such a promising and well animated first scene. not only animation but even the character designs are horrible and i am not talking about anko getting fat but rock lee looking like a diarrhea patient , gaara looking like he gets bullied twice a day etc.  3) STORY : for this one let's just look back to the OG naruto for a second , first major arc , zabuza arc tells us a lot about shinobi world and how ninja fight , showing us how cruel the world of shinobi actually is , followed by chunin exam arc (my personal fav arc till this day) we are introduced to several major characters , not only are the fights in this arc great but characters had so many emotions , they are well written , for eg , gaara brought fear in our hearts ,  Orochimaru was creepy and scary ,  rock lee showed us that there are characters stronger then team 7 in his first fight vs sasuke , almost every character had a purpose, neji had an ambition , a good backstory and a ideology he believed in , rock lee had his unbreakable determination , gaara had a scary and hidden aspect to him etc , after this there was konoha crush , here we saw what a true kage level battle looks like , then Sasuke retrival arc. now looking at boruto , the arcs lack strong emotions , there is almost zero character development , characters are too bland (except kawaki as he has a good backstory and development) almost every good arc is dominated by naruto and sasuke , and the chunin exam was slaughtered before our eyes.",anime,ocufg6

"Is this a W idea? Hear me out, I come up with anime ideas in my head all the time and I just came up with this. 20 years ago zones across America similar to Hong Kong which are semi-autonomous form to create ""SEZ's"" also known as Special Economic Zones. This specific one is set in a zone set up out of Northern New Jersey called Capett City, one of the most dangerous cities in the world similar to Roanapur from Black Lagoon, a safe haven for drugs, crime and prostitution. Our MC used to live in one of the most dangerous parts of this SEZ called ""The Exclusion Zone"". When he is 13 he is able to escape this zone and move to the country with his father, now here's a twist. He is sent by a God (possibly any God it is unknown whether it is Christian God or any other religion, leaves no room for wokeness) not by his own will but by the gods will, back to the exclusion zone to knock out the unholiness in the area. He isn't allowed to leave the area for more than 4 days. He is allowed to ask for 3 things before he enters the city, and he asks for a home, 50 thousand dollars in seed money, and contact with his father (most of his family lives in the zone itself) He devises a plan to unite the community using its danger, pushing drugs and merging many gang, meeting a woman along the way (if this ever becomes something it will have sex/graphic content, it is literally about the ins and outs and the struggles of life) who runs a gang and they begin dating and going on the pursuit of uniting the Capett City crime world so our MC can achieve his goal of going back home. (MC has a very tragic backstory, his mother was a prostitute to afford an education for her children and alot of trauma was caused for MC due to this) The anime may have alot of American music in it to show the average life as the MC is portrayed as American. The city known as Capett City is placed in one of the most ethincally diverse areas in america so as a result we will see tons of different people and character archetypes, attributing to perfect world building, depth and a amazing story.

"Katase is… NOT a cat! ( MILD Spoilers for My Tiny Senpai) I’m a firm believer that there’s a sort of conspiracy going on in this show:     Although Katase is frequently portrayed with cat ears and cat-like traits, these are present just to emphasize her cuteness. Not once have I seen her pushing glasses off the table or acting bratty or even trying to decline any sort of attention from people.   The problem is clear, it’s certainly not in my head and the man behind this entire conspiracy is no other than Akina, her manager.     Akina is a sucker for love stories.   Even if he seems like a reliable manager for a well-established company in the sweets-making industry, in reality, he only wants to see the relationship between Katase and her Kohai develop.   That’s right, he is a shipper, he is us!     The show is just your usual Romance-SliceOfLife-Like Anime, similar to the likes of Uzaki-Chan or My Dress-up Darling only with, perhaps, faster development. So imo it values your time a bit more in this aspect.   Fan service is certainly present but it’s done with a bit more taste than in other shows, mostly booba shots (and oh boy, there is enough booba to show) but so far no skin has been shown.   Comedy-wise, as with most romance shows, it’s centered mostly around absurd events where the male MC is making up lewd scenarios in his head or is absolutely oblivious to Katase’s hints.   This, for me, is a drawback but I acknowledge that most romances end up having this type of comedy.   Personally, I am enjoying the show as it is… I don’t believe it’s a gem or anything but it’s definitely worth a watch if you have the time; ofcourse my assessment could be incredibly wrong because there are only 3 episodes so far and the show is going in a good direction.     Take what you want from this post, but I will be watching this for… personality reasons   Pray out \^\^",anime,156k76y

However once 2010 came around there was a noticeable dip in quality. Rather than epic sagas of badass heroes anime became about shitty stories about girls with big boobs. Studios devoted more of their time and effort into animating boob jiggling than fight scenes.

"The Ancient Magus Bride Critique Typically, when watching an anime, we select a show that appeals to our interests. On other occasions, we come across shows that are highly praised. Only then we come to ask: why? What about the series attracts viewers? Well, such a question sparked our intrigue in The Ancient Magus Bride. Without knowing what to expect, we soon find ourselves facing disturbing observations about the story.   For one, the idea to incorporate myths and legends that are not typically used sounds like a great undertaking. However, to fail in establishing the rules of a world is evident in poor writing. Sorcery and magic do not occur as whimsically as people believe. There are laws to balance that must be achieved. Furthermore, when introducing preexisting characters from myth, it is crucial to see that conditions check out. We see a sort of injustice occur in storywriting as well- perhaps that is faulted by the restrictions on the length allotted in an anime series. Regardless, there are more scenes that depict ""tell"" rather than ""show."" As an audience, we deserve to know the mechanics behind magic, and character roles.   In the characters of Titania and Oberon, we see where traditional myth does not align with the new interpretation. In A Midsummer Night's Dream, the play features a strong willed and independent Titania. In Shakespeare's writing of the faerie queen, he presents her with more maternal qualities- as seen in her efforts to protect a changeling boy. Oberon in the play gravely disagrees and punishes his wife with the help of Puck. Seeing that The Ancient Magus Bride takes place in England, it is safe to assume that the writer has read into the work of the greatest English playwright. In turn, although the characters are from mythology, Titania and Oberon are regarded in an English interpretation. Yet, regarding the anime, there are signs that the writer has changed the attributes of the Faerie Queen and King.  While watching Titania and Oberon interact, we do see stark contrast to their behavior. For instance, Titania claims to be mother of all faerie creatures; however, her maternal qualities are diminished. Arguably, her sexuality is more evident in the series. The manner of her character appearance is more lewd than that of a mother. Comparatively, Oberon's design is also over sexualized. His personality is more suitable of Puck rather than the Faerie King. Additionally, he physically appears as a faun. In mythology, fauns have been notoriously known for raping young women. The very fact that Oberon was too interested in Chise at first exemplifies his negative sexual connotations. Shortly, Oberon no longer took an interest in her because Elias had claimed the sleigh beggy to be his own.   [Reference:   Now, where does the term sleigh beggy derive from? In Celtic mythology, they believed that small faerie creatures inhabited the land before human kind. To research further would prove more beneficial- especially, since the writer loosely uses the allusion rather than provide a proper definition. Even though one has an interest in incorporating a vague aspect from mythology, they should still ascertain to write coherently. In The Ancient Magus Bride, we come to know a sleigh beggy as being a human tied to faerie creatures. Additionally, a being whose able to host immense magic within a frail body. Evidently, a sleigh beggy is just as rare in the series as it is in understanding their relevance to real world lore. However, given this obscurity, the risks are high in adding this element to a story. The notion of magic does not always align logically in the structure of the world we are watching in The Ancient Magus Bride. People seem to dismiss these features due to the visually appealing animation. On the other hand, they should stop themselves and ask: what's going on? After all, there are various points in the story that contradict with themselves.   [Reference:   The structure lacks integrity. A statement that can be safely said when looking into the series. In truth, the fact that the auction is overlooked as illegal is a crucial detail. The series begins with Chise allegedly agreeing to sell herself rather than try to survive. Fallacy, she is a disturbed child who knows nothing of consent- therefore, she does not have the authority to make decisions on her own. A key transition is further missed. How does a young girl know who to contact regarding the selling herself in an unlawful trade? The reality factor does not click even in this work of fiction. Later we come to see sorcerers and mages blindly accept the auction- as when Chise attempts to buy the poached dragon. However, good story writing would have worked towards shedding light on the illicit nature of these black market auctions. Chise and her fellow mages should have been able to fight back to save the dragon. The decision to comply with illicit behavior through making a purchase at a black market auction diminishes any sense of morality in these characters.   Another flaw in design is as simple as a magical pelt. When Ashen Eye gives Chise the Selkie pelt, he insists that she would be able to make her inner wishes a reality. The scene should have been more compelling- an attempt to give Chise a sense of self. On the contrary, Elias could not stand to lose his purchase so he pursues Chise. Rather than giving her time to think about herself- Elias continues his oppressive stance over her. The scene is more integral than the fallacy behind the pelt. Yet, if we are introduced to Chise's transformation as a fox, then we expect her to become a fox later when using the selkie pelt- neither bear, nor wolf. Details with the pelt seem minor, but they hold bearing in determining whether the laws of this world are cohesively intact.   Conflict creates character and plot development. What occurs when the real antagonist is glorified and overlooked? The result is Elias. Here we have a being that is not fully fae nor human. Someone who lacks emotional intellect but has lived enough years to understand age. There is a grave disconnect between the relationships present in The Ancient Magus Bride. For characters such as Titania and Oberon, they disproportionately call Elias a child. Wrong- Chise is the child of this story. The constant projection of Elias as being youthful is a disservice for Chise and the audience. Regardless of social and emotional intellect- an adult and child are two different people. An adult in the modern world would be prosecuted from attempting to take a child as a spouse. Thus, even in fiction, Elias does not have the justification to possess Chise as his bride.   In terms of conflict and character development, there are poorly written designs throughout this series. For one, the protagonist- Chise may have suffered from a traumatic event. Yet, there is not enough evidence to prove her response to that trauma is realistic. As evident in life, traumatized children do not openly trust adults. Why? Because adults are the ones who have brought pain and suffering to the child. Moreover, trusting someone, like Elias, would be unrealistic. Chise is a desperate child who needs a positive influence. However, the writer does not provide her with proper adult relationships. The fact that many adults are just as adamant about her being tied with Elias is problematic. True, there was a chance for the writer to oppose the pedophilia. When Chise first meets Angelica, she is asked if Elias has done anything weird. She confides in the adult woman that he had forced her into a bath. On a surface level, the scene should be taken as sexual assault. Even Angelica scolds Elias for his behavior. Yet, the scene is depicted in a chibi, cartoonish effect. The light hearted execution serves injustice in showing that there is a clear issue of male dominion over the poor girl. Angelica should have been written more into Chise's life as a strong surrogate maternal figure- failing to do so only creates more room for victimization.   Chise fails to develop into a strong character, because her decisions circle back to her oppressor. She tries hard to understand Elias because there is no other choice. Chise is wrongly brought to the idea that since this man like being bought her for a large sum- then she is entitled to stay with him. Elias may have initially bought her to be an apprentice. On the contrary, even as Lindel suggests, the ancient magus fails in explaining important details to Chise. The audience does not see him actually teach her. There are montages of Chise learning magic through books but the role of her instructor is disproportionate. Such is the case when he tells Chise to cleanse a village from miasma. Elias never formally gave her lessons in cleansing. He merely assumes that she can do so because of her sleigh beggy nature. Another indicator in which the writer does not fully express the rules of the world. Asides from the fact that the spirits of those involved in the putrefaction of the village beg Chise to erase their being- an idea that is not obtainable by non celestial beings. Essentially, throughout these scenes, we see Chise struggling to help others.   Throughout the story, the idea of selfishness takes place. Chise finds herself to be selfish for wanting a good life. However, she is unable to see that the true selfish individual is Elias. As mentioned above with the village cleansing, Chise comes across characters that she wants to save. Openly, Elias is one of those she thinks that she can reach. The idea that a victim can save an oppressor is not unknown. There are people who are in abusive spousal relationships that believe their oppressor can change- perhaps, the victim can become their guiding light. Such a reality given to a young girl is toxic. Chise is blind in her pursuit to heal someone else when she herself is unstable. In addition to her frail mental state, Chise's body is breaking from the use of magic. Whenever Elias comes to her aid, there is a false sense that only he can protect her. Chise is a caged bird who cannot fly because Elias breaks her wings.   There is something disturbing in grooming a character to become a victim. Traditionally, good storytelling rests on overcoming hardships. However, The Ancient Magus Bride does the opposite despite what followers believe. Even the introduction and establishment of a familiar is at a loss. Initially, Ulycess- later named Ruth- holds more development than other characters. His relationship with the deceased Isabel is made clear and transfers into the bond he gains with Chise. Ruth is seen as an older brother to the protagonist- which is realistic. As a familiar, he should have Chise's best interest at heart. On the other hand, later in the series a shift occurs. He becomes just as selfish as Elias and views Chise as an essential part of his living. Should Chise die, so will Ruth. Unfortunately for Ruth's character, he does not realize that Chise is in danger due to the man of the house. The familiar, in turn, becomes nothing more than a dog lead by another hand on the leash.   The series fails to point out the flaw in unhealthy relationships. As time passes, Chise does not understand that she is a victim. She comes across superficial bonds between male and female characters. Titania and Oberon, for instance, promote the sexual quality of adult human interaction. Evidently, Chise is not exposed enough to Angelica's relationship with her husband- which appears to be healthy. After all, children should not have to think about how adults interact. However, Chise clearly needs to know the difference between mutual love and commitment versus obsession and possession. Another character dynamic exists between Alice and her instructor. Chise learns that the young woman suffered from hardship as a child. Further, Alice crossed paths with an older man who will teach her about magic. There is a difference though between the male characters that come into contact with these young women.   For instance, Renfred takes in the young Alice because he doesn't want her to continue destroying herself with drugs. After all, the streets are not suitable to raise children. Such a problem exists in reality- children fall victim to drugs and gangs. Any compassionate adult would do what they could to intervene in such a disastrous situation. Which is why Renfred became a positive influence in Alice's life. Now, in contrast to Elias- Renfred does not seem to possess the same motivation to marry the child that he sought to take under his wing. Thd story of The Ancient Magus Bride seems to force Alice into a relationship with her mentor; rather than, allow their relationship be placed between father and daughter. If Alice did not start feeling intimate towards her surrogate father, then Chise would not feel more compelled to seek Elias as a husband.  Unfortunately, the creator did not do justice to the women of their work. No, a surrogate parent should not seek intimacy with their child. Likewise, a child should not seek adult relationships- especially, with those whose role was meant to be the parent. The issue further at hand stems from the fact that people are fixated with intimacy and tend to seek stories centered on romance. If Chise was an older woman, then there would be no issue with the pairing of her and Elias. However, that is not the case which is why the Ancient Magus Bride is controversial. Another flaw in the series is that the wrong character is punished. The creator pushes for Elias to be a being who is learning humanity through ""love."" Therefore, he is promoted as a hero to Chise instead of an antagonist. Throughout the series, we learn of the main antagonist, Joesph.   Now, the character of Joseph is far more compelling then our female protagonist. Similarly to Chise, the young boy has experienced trauma in his past. As the son of a grave digger, Joseph is ostracized and bullied by older teenagers from his village. Evidently, since not much is known of his parents, readers can assume that Joseph eventually lives alone. Through battling with loneliness and depression- Joseph wonders why he is placed on Earth. All he wants to do I be respected and useful to someone. Such becomes his downfall when the young boy meets Cartaphilus- a man born born out of a Hebrew myth.   As mentioned before, the creator of The Ancient Magus Bride indulges in the use of various myths. One in particular regards the legend of the wandering Jew. The legend of the wandering Jews is founded in part on Jesus' words given in Matthew 16:28: ""Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."" (KJV)[2] The more specific belief that the Jew who betrayed Jesus would not die before the Second Coming is derived from an apparent misreading of the Gospel of John, in which the person referred to is actually Judas Iscariot but seems to have been confused with the disciple known as John the Beloved:  And Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple following whom Jesus loved, who had also leaned on His breast at the supper, and had said, 'Lord, which is he who betrayeth Thee?' When, therefore, Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, 'Lord, and what shall he do?' Jesus saith to him, 'If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou Me.' Then this saying went forth among the brethren, that that disciple would not die.. (John 21:20-23, KJV)  [Source:  Ultimately, the character of Cartaphilus has been spoken across various locations and his role is crucial to Jewish identity.   How does this religious character fit inside The Ancient Magus Bride? Well, his role is critical in forming the foil of Chise. However, he has been demonized and viewed as taking on the guilt of someone else's punishment. Cartaphilus in the anime is separate from Joseph. The wanderer was found by the young grave digger. In earnest of having the opportunity to help another, Joseph took care of Cartaphilus. After finding frustration from being unable to heal him- Joseph agrees to become one with Cartaphilus. The decision lead to his insanity. As Cartaphilus continues to wander in myth- so does he in The Ancient Magus Bride.  Towards the end of the anime series, the relationship between the protagonist and her foil becomes clearer. When seeing the interaction between Chise and Joseph, the audience should find the latter more empathetic. After all, Chise does not behave realistically as one suffering from trauma. Even Joseph indicates that he ""can see right through"" Chise's outward appearance. Having suffered greatly as a child, Joseph has validation in his claim that Chise enjoys playing victim. He does not see the protagonist as one who is honest to herself and the world around her. Of course, the anime series will damn Jospeh simply because he is the antagonist.   However, critical thinkers should be able to see the opposite is true- Joseph is more empathetic since he is more believable. He further exposes the fact that there are people who undergo some amount of trauma- yet, instead of working towards healing, they remain stagnant. Chise continues to portray herself as a victim and one without her own mind. Even through the relationship between Joseph and Cartaphilus- Joseph is fully capable of making his own decisions. He could have maintained the character of a victim- on the other hand, Joseph decides to fight against adversity. The viewer should sympathize with the young boy because he clearly went insane despite trying to help another human being. What does Chise do? She continues to victimize herself by primarily making choices based on the wants of her male oppressor.  Despite the whimsical nature of The Ancient Magus Bride, one should be able to understand that the story is far from romantic. For instance, the subtext of the series highly implies social issues such as human trafficking and pedophilia. The relationship between Chise and Elias is toxic. Should he have played the role of a surrogate father, then the story would have been more endearing. Such as the statement said before: one of the issues pertaining to the anime series is that people fixate themselves with intimate relationships. The bond between a parent and child is far more powerful than that of two lovers. Furthermore, Chise would have more room for character development should she have been in the care of a surrogate parent. Yet, she becomes a victim of toxic masculinity. Regardless of being human or not, Elias represents masculine oppression. What separates him from other men who illicitly carry out their fantasies with children? In honesty, the only difference is that people choose to remain blind to the toxicity within Elias's character.   Mapping out the interactions between Chise and Elias will show how disturbing their relationship truly is. Return to the bathroom scene, as soon as Chise arrives at her new home- Elias forces her to take a bath. Initially, he has shown his aggressiveness towards Chise. Regardless of poor social and emotional understanding, anyone can see the power of body language. There are moments throughout the series when Elias attempts to kill Chise- revealing his bestial nature. However, she forgives him for being overbearing. Yet, there is a scene when Chise admits that she would not easily forgive and forget. There comes a time when Chise has a normal friendship with a girl from a neighboring village. When the girl spends time with Chise- Elias becomes grossly  offended. His selfish behavior entices Elias to run off into the woods. Chise follows her oppressor in attempt to bring him home. Once she finds him, the scene becomes brutal. Overwhelmed with a desire to keep Chise to himself- Elias nearly kills her. Thorns envelope the young girl- as though they were choking a flower. Such is why classic symbology should not be overlooked. Elias is denoted as a lord of thorns. That connotation in itself promotes why Elias is a negative presence in our protagonist's life. He has the power to choke and kill the flower before it grows in full bloom. Despite the horror of the scene, Chise wrongfully continues to stay by his side.   Some may argue that Elias does not have sexual feelings for Chise. On the other hand, the opposite is true. Even though Elias is not fully human- he still has a male body. Therefore, during the Christmas Eve scene, the audience should cringe after hearing what Elias says to the child in his possession. Chise sees a mistletoe above the doorway. Elias indicates that traditionally people are suppose to kiss beneath the green sprig. Imposes a kiss from a child is strange in itself when the adult figure does not behave with good intentions. Furthermore, once Chise kisses him, Elias claims, along the lines, that he ""feels something tingle below his waist."" The circumstance would have differed should he respond by saying that he felt something warm on his heart. Yet, by the statement Elias made, one can insinuate that his male body experienced something akin to an erection. The Christmas Eve scene captures the toxic desire that has been developing within Elias. He may not understand human emotion, but any living creature can present lust. Unfortunately for Chise, she is too young to understand adult concepts. Besides, children should not have to know about sex before becoming  an adult.  The environment that The Ancient Magus Bride provides for the protagonist is unhealthy. Such is the same for another set of characters. Recall that Elias is associated with thorns- well, in an old Victorian novel, there is a location denoted by thorns. Set primarily in Thornfield Hall, ""Jane Eyre"" depicts a controversial couple. The book written by Charlotte Brontë features the life of Jane Eyre, a young woman who is troubled by her abusive aunt and cousin. She eventually becomes the governess of Edward Rochester at Thornfield Hall. Despite Brontë's attempt at romance, her novel presents a darker subtext. Just as Elias sought to own Chise, so does the lord of Thornfield Hall. Elias and Rochester both have overbearing qualities and a desire to possess the female protagonists of their respected stories.   Masculine toxicity is a prevalent issue in society and it courses through the veins of many stories. For The Ancient Magus Bride and ""Jane Eyre,"" the two present an unhealthy relationship between a troubled female protagonist and the primary male figure. There is an overarching theme that suggests women are too weak to be independent. Elias and Rochester are depicted as potential saviors on the surface; rather, the subtext of their actions and mentality depict otherwise. The two male characters have shown their ability to financially support the female protagonist of their respected stories. The anceint magus has shown his egregious wealth through his purchase of Chise. Additionally, Rochester is a wealthy man who hires Jane Eyre. Socially, the two stories evoke the need for male codependency; rather than the growth of strong, female protagonists. Another factor shares between the two male characters is their overbearing influence. Both Elias and Rochester have a strong manipulative mentality regarding their interactions with their female obsessions. The ancient magus proceeds to neglect Chise's training- in effort to keep her from becoming more independent. As for Rochester, he attempts to psychologically affect Jane Eyre's decision in staying with him. An additional issue with these toxic relationships is the creator's choice in stunting the growth of their female protagonists.   Despite the age difference between Chise and Jane Eyre, both represent social flaws in society- masculine supremacy and toxic codependency. To begin, the two are not entering their stories with stable minds. Chise and Jane Eyre have experienced trauma during childhood. For one, Chise still is coping with the events of her past: being abandoned by her father, nearly choked to death by her mother, and witnessing her mother plunge to her death after feeling remorse for her actions.  In the case of Jane Eyre, she has been separated from her parents and sent to live with an abusive aunt. Both female protagonists have been written as victims rather than survivors. Such is apparent in the respected scenes where Chise and Jane Eyre leave their oppressors. At a critical moment that could have been geared towards self discovery and growing independence, these female protagonists return to their toxic environments. As stated by a critic of Brontë's novel: ""Jane’s seeming surrender—her willingness to re-enter a dysfunctional, if not abusive, relationship—infuriates scholars, too, especially those immersed in feminist theory."" Instead of returning to a man who wants to possess Jane Eyre, she should have found an alternative way to grow into a stronger female figure. Unfortunately, the young woman continues the trend of systematic misogyny by attaching herself to the overbearing Rochester.   [Reference:   Moreover, although there are similarities to the lives of the two female characters, there is a sinister truth hidden within the subtext of their creation. The existence of grooming is prevalent between both The Ancient Magus Bride and ""Jane Eyre."" On one hand, Brontë has inadvertently suggested to young women that they need to find a man to lean on whether or not their male partner is abusive and controlling. On the other hand, what separates the two female protagonists is there age. Such a factor is important to note because of the toxic nature of these stories. Seeing Chise as a young girl creates a more morbid situation: one that is evident by the fact that the general audience is around the protagonist's age.  Ultimately, age plays a large role in the horror of The Ancient Magus Bride. No, the general fanbase of the series are not young women but prepubescent and young teenagers. Yes, seeing the toxic intimacy between an older masculine figure and a young, psychologically traumatized child is worthy of controversy. Systematic misogyny has existed in stories before- as apparent in the mention of the Victorian novel, ""Jane Eyre."" On the contrary, the heavily codependent female character is a woman. Such is the reason The Ancient Magus Bride is not a romance. In reality, the story involves themes of child trafficking and pedophilia. Further, given Elias's character, we see a highly obsessive and possessive individual who places age as a means of superiority. Thus, the male character promotes oppression and manipulation. Chise has been wronged as a female protagonist because she was written as a victim. How is Chise a good role model for the young girls who watch her? The answer is blatant- she is the depiction of how one should not behave. Overall, Chise represents a child caught in the thorns of adult male desire.   *Side note: After suffering through the horrific anime of The Ancient Magus Bride, there was not intention to read the work of Kore Yamazaki. Whether or not the original creator intended the story to have such a negative presence in regards to the real issues of child trafficking and pedophilia should not matter in exposing the problems at hand. Otherwise, we are committing injustice to the young girls who are too young to see the danger behind Chise's relationship with Elias. The suggestion is that more thought and study be taken into place with this and similar series. After all, the truth must be unveiled in order to reach a solution in how to handle such sensitive materials.",anime,v8r9iq

"AOT is overrated Before I begin you have to know that I read the Manga and watched some clips through TikTok and like. I know AOT is great but I also think that it is overrated as hell. I watch anime since I was 6 or so (I’m 20 now) and I watch a fair amount of good stuff and horrible bad shit. AOT is still one of the better ones (if I have to rate it I would give it a 7/10 which is very good in my eyes).  Tbh my biggest problem with it is when Eren becomes the antagonist. Everyone acts like it’s the best plot they ever saw but I don’t think so. I think the moment he became the antagonist his plot amor got so thick that it feels like he would survive a Atomic Bomb. Whatever happens I never got the feeling that he is in real danger, that he would somehow someway survive and get over anything. That feeling only got stronger the further I read up until the moment were everyone groups up to kill him.  I would love to be proven otherwise and also would love to hear some other opinions",anime,ti32cb

Why not give it a rest and call them something else   I don't wanna say this to offend anyone but  Dragon ball will always be the king  The big 3 will always be the big 3 ( Naruto, bleach and one piece)  Maybe it's time to pass down the torch, Yes. But the new gen could never stand side by side It's time for the new era . The new Stars. They should have their own tag like the big 3 . calling the new gen tops big 3 or adding them side by side with them and calling them big 4 doesn't do them justice  In my opinion ( not trying to offend anyone)  Instead why not call them something else Like horsemen ( again just my opinion) That way there will be no confusion when we mention big 3 or the new gen anime.",anime,1bdty3h

"OP anime MC's not trying hard enough What's with anime MC's not taking their OP-ness seriously? I'll use the classic, Bleach, as my example for this discussion.  Let's take a look at Ichigo, He's a teenage, still living human who is exposed to the world of soul reapers and hollows and in what amounts to a very short amount of time, he powers up to a level where he can go tow to toe with captains that have been clapping cheeks for hundreds of years and have an extensive knowledge of everything that soul reapers can do.   His power is obviously a variant of your average sole reefer and his growth rate is exceptional but he seems to take no interest in learning everything he can about the nature of and abilities of available to sole reapers unless it becomes an immediate necessity for a current conflict.   Seems like everything he learns about shocks and surprises him even though most others in that world know it by default and he never seems to take an interest in learning any of the hado/kiddo techniques that everyone else can use, I get it, maybe it takes extensive education and practice that he doesn't have time for but if he could at least dedicate himself to learning one single simple one, his variant power could probably turn that little fireball that Rukia uses all the time into a devastating soul cannon of sorts.  Not to mention he doesn't seem to care about how different he is from the rest of them, oh my sword doesn't have a sealed form? Whatever. Oh my bonkai is drastically different from anyone else's? Oh well. Not to mention early on, the whole evil hollow version of himself that sometimes talks to him in his head and occasionally takes over his body, laying waste to everything around him with abilities he's never used before and he treats it like a minor annoyance without ever really delving into what the hell it is or what it means for him later on.  Also when he sees this hollow version of himself using abilities that he's never used before, it takes him so long to figure out how to use getsuga on his own and he doesn't even appear to think about it until then. Also, similar to Goku, he only seems to have breakthroughs in power advancement after getting his ass clapped or these brief, experimental training procedures that consist of either him getting slapped around by a bunch of stronger people until he snaps or forcing him to exert some kind of self-discipline on himself in order to access something that he should have been doing all along, only Goku at least understands the fundamentals of fighting and is shown to be constantly training in his off time and when he needs an extra boost he's got things like training in other world or the hyperbolic time chamber or activating ultra instinct which basically puts him on autopilot for badass mode.   Ichigo is just a teenager who constantly acquires new and horrifyingly powerful abilities that he doesn't seem to spend any time thinking about, like when he finally learns how to use his mask he gets a power boost but he should have the ability to use cero like the visords but the only time he ever seems to do so is when his hollow self takes over in one form or another, seems like if he spent a little more time contemplating his own abilities and trying to understand how and why, he'd be able to do a lot more, a lot sooner.   I for one think that if I was suddenly exposed to an entire reality that I never knew existed and somehow I was a powerhouse of badassery in that world, I would spend every spare moment practicing and asking people questions and trying to learn every possible thing that I should be capable of in order to maximize my understanding of my own abilities as well as b strong enough to ""protect my friends"" more efficiently, I mean just imagine if he had cared to learn the ins and outs of being a soul reaper sooner than being in a critical moment where people are dying and you're the only hope, The show wouldn't be very exciting if he actually learned about how everything works and practiced to be able to do the same things that everyone else can do combined with his variant power, he would clap everybody's cheeks into oblivion without having the whole struggle, loss and overcoming aspect of every time he's forced to level up.  I know this is long-winded but I'm on a tangent and I want to hear some attempts to apply logic to what is obviously just a plot point, entertaining TV needs struggle and overcoming obstacles to keep you captivated but in a realistic scenario, someone like Ichigo has been massively underutilizing his abilities the entire time he's had them haha  Tell me what you think, let the comments flow!",anime,192zeu8

I did not realize that titan was a female and I think she is the Sasha of the Marlian people, as Sasha was for the Eldians.

It involves a “bitchy” (I don’t like to use that term but it’s fitting) female protagonist who has some kind of strong feeling about the main male protagonist (whether it be love or hate) and will not shut up about it throughout the whole show and gets very defensive. I hate it, it’s annoying not to mention vaguely misogynistic. It happens in western shows but there is a kind of archetype more specific to anime. What’s the deal with this?

"LvL1 Demon Lord, MAY(?) just be the best Slice of Life of the season (First episode, MILD SPOILERS) I want to start by prefacing that this will be just an early look at the show. Haven’t read the manga so I got no idea how the story is going to play out             So picture this:    You are the Demon Lord, a random hero(and his party) defeats you so you decide to wake up from your 10-year-long slumber in order to take revenge on him.    Your resurrection was quite premature so your power is but a shadow of what it used to be and the only other Demon from your ex-demon lord ranks, that’s still alive, is your secretary.    She is quite the devout acolyte so she has already prepared for the possibility of you coming back sooner than planned with… school girl outfits?    Anyways, you have one and only reason for existing and that is finally killing your mortal enemy, Max the Hero.    You ask your secretary, Zenia, if she knows what are the current whereabouts of the Hero, perhaps he is still protecting humanity on the frontlines, or maybe he’s made so much money he lives like a billionaire. You are in utter disbelief when you find out she has no idea if Max is still alive so you decide to go take a look yourself. Only to find out, Max, the guy that killed you and saved humanity… is a shut-in, a NEET.        LvL1 Demon Lord is the story of a man that couldn’t find his place in society.    Although he saved the planet, once the Demon Lord was dead, humanity didn’t need him anymore so he ended up not being able to find a place to thrive in, basically your average midlife-crisis    It’s not actually only society’s fault… his accomplishments got to his head so he ended up being part of a few... let's say allegations. The rest of his hero party is actually doing fine.        What makes this really good and an actual contender for being a great slice of life, is the fact that Maou, our demon lord, decides to do the most unhinged thing any person would do to his mortal enemy… starts taking care of him.    I didn’t stutter, that’s exactly what you read, he starts picking up his trash, cooking for him, and even later on protects him from a pack of bullies. All with the sole purpose of eventually fighting him after he gets back on his feet, ofcourse    It is a great premise, with pretty good comedic moments so if the characters keep having the same chemistry I truly believe this could be an amazing watch, by slice-of-life standards.    The setting is fantasy in a modern scenario, so I really wanna know how the whole - Demon Lord living together with a Hero in the middle of a city, trying to get accustomed to modern technology and live a normal life all while getting a Middle-Aged man out of depression - scenario will play out.    They might be going on a somewhat Ecchi route, even tho it doesn’t have the tag, so I am afraid this might scare a few people out of it, but from what I’ve seen so far, I urge you to give it a try… at least see the first episode for yourself and then decide whether it's worth your time or not.

The hopes and trust you put in them for a long period of time shattered in seconds after seeing you do better without them and forget ABOUT THE PROMISE.

"Naruto vs One Piece Please understand that everyone has an opinion and that it entirely depends on personal preference before I share mine.        I adore both of them, and after reading their respective manga and watching their respective anime, I could see what made them stand out from the rest of the anime available.        The artwork is too good and flawless in one piece. The art in the manga version of Naruto is also fantastic. The entire story is consistent with both of their artistic creations.        Because Eiichiro Oda is the God of Foreshadowing, One Piece's storyline and storytelling quality are far superior to Naruto's. However, anyone who has read or watched One Piece knows that no matter what happens, Luffy and the rest of the straw hat crew will not perish. With Naruto, this is not the case. Many people died, and those deaths influenced the characters. The third, for instance, features Jiraiya, Hayate, Obito, Itachi, Danzou, Neji, and so on. There were times when we weren't sure if significant characters would survive a crisis. Gaara, for instance, following bijuu extraction, etc. Compared to other anime series that concentrate on a world of magic, one piece has a very low death toll.        The One Piece story is more complex than Naruto's, despite the fact that its characters have a stronger plot armour. You feel the emotions immediately. One Piece is better at making you cry than even some of the heartbreaking scenes in Naruto.        The voice actors in Naruto and One Piece are on par, but One Piece's dubbing is mediocre in comparison to Naruto's. In the dubbing of one piece, there are times when the words are not clear and the majority of the scenes lack emotion.        One Piece's soundtracks can't compare to Naruto's. However, I can assure you that watching One Piece is a better experience than watching Naruto.        Even after sticking with Naruto for 700 episodes and enduring annoying fillers, Naruto Shippuden could have gone much better because we are not given the opportunity to see Naruto ascend to the position of hokage in Naruto. Then a new protagonist is introduced, but he fails miserably and pales in comparison to the Naruto of our collective youth. Yes, I am referring to Boruto.        One piece makes a lot of claims, but even after nearly 900 chapters and 820 episodes, we still barely understand what the piece is or what D's will is. I have the utmost respect for Eiichiro Oda because that takes a great deal of talent. Since the release of Boruto, I believe my respect for Kishimoto-sensei has decreased. Boruto makes a lot of claims, but he will never be as compelling a protagonist as Naruto. I won't accept Boruto as the greatest anime ever, even if it does, because I don't see how a conceited brat like him can replace the erratic and hyperactive Konohagakure no Sato ninja.        One Piece is superior to Naruto if you only consider Naruto and Naruto Shippuden in this comparison, but only because Naruto wasn't finished as well as it could have been and also because One Piece has better foreshadowing, which makes it more exciting to watch (you literally have to examine every panel of the manga carefully for any hints to the future). Because of this, One Piece will continue to be my favourite anime.        However, I believe that you should rely more on your own judgement than on mine. We might have different tastes. Who knows, you might prefer hokage to pirate kings, jutsus to devil fruits, headbands to hats, or ninjas to pirates.",anime,13ye7a5

"Kaguya is obviously far stronger than momoshiki. The fact that momoshiki is stronger litteraly destroys the powerlevels and creates a LOT of plothole. what do you think? Guys feats are speaking clear and momoshiki being stronger than her litteraly ruins all the powerscalings and the plot. FUSED momoshiki wasn't even able to break gaara's wall with his punch, gaara was able to react to him with his sand (he couldn't do that even with a lighter sand thanks to onhoki back in the days against madara) the fact that some of you thinks that the new kages are now lowballed juubidara level just because of training is a bad take, not even gai with his 24/24 training and the 8th gate was as strong as juubidara, so how did they train? did they ask goku if they could use the hyperbolic time chamber? kages as shown by naruto don't even have time to train that much. the reality here is that adult naruto and sasuke became actually weaker than their teenselfs since they LOST hagaromo's chakra and that kaguya is far superior than momoshiki. almost every plothole and bad powerscaling in boruto is created by the fact that momoshiki is stronger than kaguya thats how bad that is. ANY statements (and there are no clear ones) is obviously debunked by the feats, starting from the fact that momoshiki tought that half of kurama's chakra was massive when in comparison to the ten tails and kaguya its nothing, and finishing from the fact that this juvinile ten tails is still relevant when it shouldn't, the kages LITTERALY showed concerns when another ten tails was brought up (if they are that strong they could easly onetap the ten tails right?). everyone that thinks Momoshiki>Kaguya is tatally delusional thats it. its mind boggling to me that some of you think that those kages became that strong for NO REASON, naruto with his 1000 episodes clearly lets you understand that to be powerfull you need to have either of (and preferably all of those things that i'm about to list) a tailed beast, massive chakra, super broken techniques, good eyes, sage mode, SIX PATHS CHAKRA and the kages have NOTHING OF THAT SORT , they don't even train remotely close as gai so why should we belive that they became broken like that especially since in the anime (and most if not all of it is canon especially the onhoki's arc that i'm about to bring up) the  earth kage got KIDNAPPED BY A KID (is this kid at least juubidara level too?) this kid got killed by a super old onhoki (is a super old onhoki not only stronger than his war version but also stronger than juubidara now?). Tell me in what universe momoshiki the arrogant (that never backed up his arrogance since he got trashed by everyone) is stronger than kaguya (plus he didn't even know that kaguya placed a tree so he was clearly referring to her pre fruit).",anime,11y1eay

"One piece makes no sense within it's own world For starters in order to break the limits of human capabilities in a story you must first establish a magic system around that human limitation. The most common of human limitations exaggerated in anime by magic is strength. DBZ uses Ki, Naruto uses Chakra. One piece doesn't do anything in regards to how characters push their limits, yet we still see them lifting boats without explanation.  Luffy is made of rubber and they established why that's good not while his base form makes no logical sense i don't want to talk about it. Gear 2nd makes no sense, they never explained how he pumps his blood. Gear 3rd makes no sense, he bite's into his bone and blows into it but why doesn't the air just come right back out. Gear 4th makes no sense for the same reasons Gear 3rd makes no sense.  Zoro's 3rd sword is utterly useless and goes against the point of having 2 swords. for 1 if you block with the sword in your mouth you have a high chance of breaking your neck given the enemies they fight. Whenever Zoro uses the 3rd sword in an average confrontation he pulls back the 2 other swords to use his 3rd one. Not to mention it's just unneeded weight and when he does use all 3 of his swords it's extremely delayed and look stupid and wacky  For Sanji i want to focus my attention on devil foot and red hawk Lluffy's move)  Sanji spins his foot so fast that it creates enough friction to ignite his foot. Luffy just lights his hand on fire somehow. Why doesn't the fire spread up Sanji's leg exactly? And why does it increase his attack power and SPEED? The same applies to red hawks except it makes even less sense since we don't even know how he uses it.  please don't insult me i'm not trying to insult Oda's writing these are just some thoughts that i wanted to discuss",anime,113hla8

i need some one piece advice. So i have reached the first episode of zou and until this point I've watched one piece in dub because I was used to it. I'm thinking about switching to sub so i can get used to the voice actors but I'm so used to the dub that i almost don't want to. I know it will be better in the long run but there's just some sub voices i don't like. Should I just switch and bear with it for these first couple episodes or should I wait until i can't watch anything but sub so i have no choice to switch?,anime,xim8jx
"One piece post time skip struggle HELP pls 😭 I'm in agony pls someone help, so I'm watching one piece (like so many anime fans) not a weeb but I'm completing all the old gen animes that I started as a kid and enjoying it for now I finished naruto and inuyasha they were fantastic and wholesome animes and now I'm watching One piece .... an amazing anime that I loved as a kid and still feel so excited watching as an adult watching luffy and the crew and their adventures and heartbreaking stories and just the crew dynamic changing throughout the hard times they went through together and I loved it especially gate 8 filler arc is where I actually started enjoying so much to the point were I was like I got to finish it, seeing the cew getting bigger and working together and being so different yet so alike when it comes to their nakama ,enies lobby was an amazing emotional experience too ,thriller bark,marineford was just mindblowing I couldn't stop crying for ace even when people already spoiled it for me and then .... I reached the episode 517 and that's where the time skip happens so basically the crew take a 2 years break to train each on their own in different islands and 518 is when they get back together and we are supposed to be introduced to the new crew and how they look and see their development after the 2 years time skip .... and I'm in ACTUAL pain??! 😭 .. why is robin so white?  all of a sudden like huh??! I'm crying I hate it here... where is my lovely brown skinned mature and classy robin who would wear a sarong beach skirt and a crop top and sit in the back quietly laughing at her crewmates being idiots and enjoying their adventures cause now she looks like a second boa Hancock and I already love the boa Hancock we have i just can't look at the new Robin and not feel weird as hell ..... who tf is this white girl who is 80% boobs 20% personality??? and now sanji my goodness which I'm so disappointed he had no character development AT ALL while being in Kamabakka Kingdom he just got stronger THAT'S IT ,he still THE simp for nami and it's not funny anymore ,I want the sanji we got introduced to in the first episode where he appeared in baratie restaurant looking all classy gentleman ladies man sanji who is a passionate chef ,smart gentle and kindhearted yet has swag and knows when to be serious and when to let loose and be a classy simp? like the way he asked moodie to have a drink with him was so classy and awesome  ... he wasn't an idiot simp with heart eyes who has nose bleeds every 2 seconds, he had swag and was smart and his character wasn't based on him being dumb 24/7 around girls and abandoning his nakama for those dumb ass looking like bitches ... also ussop is still a scaredy cat even after all the training, chopper still acts like he is 9 years old , he is 17 for god's sake , frankie just looks awful, zoro ..... where do i start he is not that bad at all but he seems emotionless like where is the old unbothered loosen up zoro who had a contagious laugh and actually had fun beside fighting and fighting and losing all his blood yet staying alive ... where is his back story at?? He is a great character and I love Zoro but I need to know more about him his back story seems .... not completem Nami is 90% boobs 10% personality buying all those clothes just to wear a bra, now I understand for guys it's heaven and I'm happy for my homies but I guess I was the only one who wanted her and robin to at least have tiny biceps or beat the shit out of their opponents and be as strong as the guys, not just be walking boobs beautiful face boobs tiny waist boobs less clothes and boobs ..... I hope the boys enjoy that i guess I'm just weird cause I expected strong females in One piece anyways .... also a lot may hate boa Hancock but I love her she is so strong and confident and can protect themselves and not cry out for people to help them *cough* sakura trash can *cough*I love strong females cause they are rare in animes also tashigi and boa hancock are so neglected I wanted tashigi to at least gets zoro respect and be a better snowman after timeskip .... they nerfed her so bad and I don't understand her role in the story no more even tho she looks like quina and kind hearted still she had no important scene in any arc and zoro still don't respect her as a swordman ugh she would have been a great opponent to challengexzoro to get better and motivate one another  .... anyways I think I just expected more and now I'm all disappointed and I want to watch the post time skip so bad but I watched the first episode of fisherland and couldn't stop cringing 😭 someone help me or give me a solution or advice to how to accept these changes and I know the first two arcs are shit but I don't wanna skip straight to wci even tho someone told me wci sanji is amazing and i would get to love him again HELP PLEASE and don't make fun of my expectations I'm just devastated and probably talking nonsense and being an ass but after watching naruto only to be greeted with dumb ass boruto stupid animation and now one piece then boom post time skip changes idk what to do anymore 😭",anime,x50gaz

"Looking for an anime This may be a long shot but there is an anime that I was watching but never finished, now I can’t remember the title. I will try my best to describe it. Please help if you can. I think the MC was a monk that was really overpowered, the MC and love interest knew each other in a past life, the woman in the past life was goddess/deity (possibly a fox deity)and she fell in love with the MC who was a boy at the time, the boy escaped from a ship and was found by the deity, one scene in particular showed the boy giving her his blood and she surged with power and went ape on the pirates who was trying to keep the boy because they knew there was power in the boys blood, eventually the boy grew up and became OP and tried sealing the big baddie away which I can’t remember anything about the baddie then died sealing the baddie then the deity passed on to be with the man I’m the afterlife in which they both reincarnated into the MC and love interest that the anime revolves around.

"How many of you reached a point where you just instantly skip or quit seasonal anime For example you look at the cover, read synopsis, or even just the title and skip because you already know what the plot is going to be, or what events will happen. Maybe it’s also because you’ve seen the exact same plot device used. Like often times this anime goes viral and you watch it and go, it’s basically just this older anime but with better animation, or stronger characters etc. An example I saw was JJK, having a similar plot device to noragami, and blue exorcist. Where the curses are invisible monsters that cause harm to humans similar to demons in blue exorcist. They are also born out of negative human emotions like with Noragami’s phantoms. The high ranking curses remind me of the demon kings in blue exorcist. Everything else seems original ig or I don’t remember any others. I’d like to hear some of your experiences. I still watched it and found it meh because it didn’t feel like anything new, except for the beautiful animation.",anime,v28bkz

"Westerners relate manga to their own race, probably. Might be just me projecting. But I noticed once again that manga characters due to the simplistic style are race bendable (if obviously not african style super black).  So I find myself not relating most anime characters to japanese ethnicity at all. I happen to not live in japan at the moment and their facial features are a bit alien and fascinating. Exceptions such as blatantly asian style anime like mononoke apply.  It kind of makes sense too. When I begun my anime journey the most I knew about japan was that they wear samurai swords all the time, that they frequently harakiri themselves and that they serve a poisonous fish that sometimes end up killing a customer. Guess what I least found whilst travelling there for months.",anime,lbj65x

"Gege Akutami's latest interview confirms the status of Satoru Gojo's parents in Jujutsu Kaisen      In a recent interview, \*Jujutsu Kaisen\* creator Gege Akutami provided some long-awaited details about the background of Satoru Gojo's parents.   Akutami confirmed that Gojo's parents are still alive, though they are not particularly strong Jujutsu Sorcerers.   Despite their weak abilities, they gained a higher status within the Gojo clan due to Gojo's birth.   Because of Gojo's immense power, he was separated from his parents at a very young age to focus on his intense training.  Akutami also clarified that Gojo is an only child, which is significant considering the many fan theories about possible siblings.   Growing up, Gojo's life was anything but ordinary.   Due to his unique abilities, he was treated differently by both his family and the Jujutsu world, leading to a rather isolated childhood.   This isolation likely influenced his strong sense of independence and his decision to become a Jujutsu Sorcerer.   These insights provide a deeper understanding of Gojo's character, explaining his distant relationship with his family and the solitary path he has walked as one of the most powerful figures in the Jujutsu world.",anime,1en8kl8

"Pre Rant below👇 This bill is too vague and extreme, people says it would only target “Lolis” but that’s just naive and depending on which dinosaur judge think it’s a good idea, you can’t possibly guarantee that. Let me say this first, I do not like loli but this law targets ANYTHING that slightly depicts minors “obscene”. Which is quoted from the law. Such something as simple as wearing a bathing suit applies to showing legs. This would be ban most of our favorite shonen and many other anime as well. Such as Dragon Ball, One Piece, Re Zero, Chainsaw Man, Naruto, JJK, DanDaDan, Black Clover, Berserk, Bleach, Fire Force, HxH, Devilman, Higurashi, and much more. All and Any anime with fan service would be affected. Also the law says not just teenagers but young adults that look like teenagers. So anything could be fair game as long as they claim it is. Not just anime but American tv shows like family guy, Rick and Morty, South Park and Boondocks etc as well and even video games like Persona, Baldurs Gate, or even Final Fantasy etc or god knows how far to an extent they will go to defy the word “obscene.” The law is specifically vague on purpose for they can pick and choose what to ban. “Obscene” could also mean gore, death, alcohol and drug use or literally anything else that goes against your morality or just don’t like. So you can definitely add Attack on Titan and Demon Slayer to that list as well. This law will open up pandoras box and allow them to further censor whatever they feel like and I’m extremely disappointed a lot anime fans support this because they think it’s specifically targeting one group of people but it’s not while not realizing they’ll also get locked up and thrown in the same jail. The bill is vague on purpose for they can dictate what they want banned. I think Texas should fuck off and focus on helping actual kids by finding the thousands of missing kids getting trafficked in their own state and arrest the god knows how many pedophiles are preying",anime,1jdpwqu

Some happy moments throughout the anime are fine as long as they’re few and far between and the story ultimately ends unhappily.

With the spinning and the flipping and the positions between tricks. If anyone has any idea that'd be so helpful. I saw it when I was smol so like...early 2000s? Maybe on Adult Swim maybe on G4TV?

"Romance anime where guy is more special/takes most of the attention of viewers? What i mean is that most romance animes nowadays, the guy is quite plain and shy while the girl is unique, for example My dress up darling, dont toy with me miss nagatoro, darling in the franxx, and etc. Its one reason i liked love is war, where both chracters felt equally special and both took the attention of the viewers.

"Anime that deals specifically, exclusively and deeply, or at least seriously, with the involuntary loss of enthusiasm for everything in general, especially for what not so long ago the MC was most passionate about, and the frustration of suffering from this? But I'm not looking for an anime where that's one of the aspects or points, and perhaps it's treated, but in one episode and/or very superficially/generally.  I'm looking for an anime where, as I indicate in the title, that this is the epicenter of the plot.  That even when the MC is reviving or has a unique opportunity or something related to something the MC were passionate about before, the MC still feels nothing, and during or afterward, the MC feels frustrated at no longer being able to enjoy or feel excited.  It's also important to emphasize this: that this radical loss of excitement is completely involuntary and not at all desired, not voluntary, and that the origin of this is unknown, meaning it just happens.  I'm sorry for being perhaps too specific, and I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't 100% exactly as I describe, but I would at least like to know which ones might come closest to this, even if they're not exactly the same.",anime,1kosyw6

"Recommendations for any RomCom X Action. (Could be manga too) Pretty much the title. However it can't have any sort of harem (like yona of the dawn). Honestly I want it to focus on the plot as much as it does on romance and they get together early on in the series (before someone recommends me smt like summertime rendering). To be honest this isnt even an anime but kind of like Lance and Allura in Voltron. And the best example I could think of was Sword art online ONLY season 1. I am pretty much looking for something like black clover but the romance is more emphasized.  bro chat gpt keeps on giving me stuff where they get together final episode, like toradora. I think fate stay night perfectly shows what i want here. They get together season 1 and there are still a season 2 where they are together and it focuses on plot as well as romance. CHAT PT LIED TO ME AGAIN. THEY MUST GET TOGETHER WAY BEFORE THE FINAL EPISODE AT LEAST MID WAY OR FINAL 5 EPISODES",anime,1kpgnyz

Lewd Anime that has tons of fan service but has a serious plot / is not a comedy? I am one of those shameless degenerates that likes fan service and lewd scenarios in my anime.

Classic heroes journey, the MC starts out as a nobody but becomes a great hero by the end of it  2. Great Chemistry between the MC and FMC, a clean romance with no unnecessary drama or love triangles, and it is present throughout and slowly builds throughout the episodes.  3. Great action scenes, duels, monster fights, large scale battles and wars, there was a lot of variety and it was well animated.  4. Completed story in the anime itself, no need for further reading.  I'm looking for more series that fulfil all or most of these criteria. Please recommend such series of you know any, and thanks in advance to all the helpful people.",anime,1klklon
"An anime with an interesting concept about its power or how the world revolves? So far I've really loved the idea of undead unluck where everyone has this power to negate a rule in their world. Its so simple yet effective for a ""power system"".  I also liked what they did with chainsaw man, I thought its just about devils and that felt like so common. Until I've realized their power depends on how much this phenomenon/material is feared by humans.   These animes were fun to watch because I ended up guessing what might their powers be.

I recently went through a breakup with someone I truly considered the love of my life, and things at home are pretty messed up too.  Weird as it may sound, I’m looking for something *depressing* to watch—stuff that helps me process what I’m feeling.

Some things I’ve liked: *Berserk*, *Evangelion*, *Devilman Crybaby*, *Nana*, *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*. I just finished *Wicked City*—while its aesthetic intrigued me, I found the narrative pretty basic. So yeah, story and emotional weight are what I care about most.

Ever since then, I’ve been trying to find something with the same kind of feeling.  What I loved about Frieren was how calm and comforting it was. The pacing was slow but never boring, and I liked how it focused more on emotions, memories, and the little moments rather than just action. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED the action as well. And it was so well made like what the heck?? The way their hair moves is animated better than entire fight scenes in some other anime I’ve watched hahaha.  I guess I’m just looking for something chill and easy to watch, but that still has heart. Something that makes you feel things, but not in a super heavy or intense way.

Just to add, while I loved Psycho-Pass, I'm not usually a fan of very dark or serious toned series, I don't like shows screaming ""I'm dark"" for the sake of it, hence why I liked Made in Abyss so much, dark plot but innocent design.",anime,1kl3tk9

"Any fast-paced comedy anime? I just finished prison school, and although the ecchi scenes sometimes went too far and made me uncomfortable, the comedy scenes were hilarious. I really liked the fast pace and the absurd animation that it had. Any recommendations for something similar?",anime,1km6sce
"Anime with no MC I'm looking for an Anime kinda like One Piece, My hero Academia... People with super powers fighting other people with super powers or Monsters (can be a side plot). My problem with all of these is the insane focus on the MC. For example in One piece Luffy is always the one defeating the big Boss and if they do it together he Deals the finishing blow. MHA has the same problem with the plot always being around Deku, at the beginning he's only a quite weak youngster but the further the story goes the more he's in the Center and defeats the big bad guy. So now I'm looking for something with no MC or constant changing MC. Record of Ragnarok would count as I'd see Brunhild as the MC but she doesn't defeat the ""enemies"" and no one defeats 2 ""enemies"" but I can't think of something else.",anime,1kkq3pd
"Anime like Solo Leveling, Tower of God, Kaiju No. 8 Basically fast paced good battle shonen with a portion of mystery and high production values.

Surprised nobody recommended Dragon Ball Z tbh.    Does anyone have anything outside MAL’s top 100 most popular anime?",anime,1kl0w39

Fantasy anime with a lot of romance like Chillin’ in another world with level 2 super cheat skill A harem anime is good too as long as theirs actually romance going on (specifically not just the girls drooling over the mc and him not caring/noticing).

"Adult Lovestory Hello everyone,  I've been watching anime for a while now, but I've never really drifted into the romantic corner. Now I've tried a few anime (e.g. Danmachi). I liked it, but I would like to see a more adult love story. Does anyone have any suggestions?   What do I mean? Well, for one thing, it would be nice if the characters showed that they have life experience. For me, that means that the characters don't have a nervous breakdown the first time they hold hands. I know that this ""childish"" image is cultivated in Japan in particular, but I would like something outside this circle. I hope it's clear what I'm looking for.   Thank you very much for any recommendations.",anime,1klwybr
"Historical anime? By historical, I mean that it actually covers some real-life history and facts like **Golden Kamuy**, where the mangaka consulted a local historical society and real Ainu people to write the story.   However, I'll also settle for just historical vibes like **Vinland Saga**, which I really enjoyed.   Anime in this vein that I've seen and liked:  - **Apothecary Diaries** - **Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** - **91 Days**  **Kingdom** and **Baccano** were highly recommended just in general, so they're on my watch list. However, I don't really care for **Dr. Stone**. 😅  Thank you!  Edit: Wow! About 75% of the recommendations so far are series I've never even heard of, but sound right up my alley. I appreciate everyone who's shared titles already & thanks in advance for forthcoming suggestions!! 🙇‍♀️",anime,1knnf7e

In Kengan Ashura and Baki (and lots of other anime) there are frail weak fighters that beat athletes through just better strategy or fighting knowledge, but they're not #1 cos their frailty  Would be cool to see a old master somehow body swap or other way control a 150KG mega strong body and combine skill + physical strength to become godlike     in Invincible next season it looks like the devil is gonna body snatch the strongest physical body on earth it's gonna be amazing seeing what they can do, but i can't wait that long lol",anime,1klgqih

"Story that depicts the awkwardness of not understanding love/ romantic feelings I’m new to this topic, so sorry if I don’t have the vocabulary to fully articulate what I mean, but like the title says I want a story that depicts the awkwardness of not understanding love/ romance.   It doesn’t have to be specifically a romance story, but it’s fine if it is. Honestly, the closest example that I can think of is Denji from Chainsaw Man. I love how he’s this teenage boy that has not been shown affection his entire life, so he doesn’t full understand what he wants out of life. Specifically with women, he thinks he was to touch a boob or have sex, but as the story progresses he’s realizing that he’s more interested in having a connection with someone.   I’d prefer if it was more adult like scenarios or characters because that is more relevant to me. Plus I feel like I’d feel weird watching watching a love story about middle schoolers.   Even though I’d prefer a manga, preferably on Shonen Jump because it’s easily accessible, I’m not looking for specifically an anime or manga.   Please let me know if I’m not being descriptive enough, or if you just want more details.   Edit: I forgot to say that I’m not looking for a “will they won’t they” style. It doesn’t matter to me if the main character gets with the person they’re going after for. They don’t even have to be going after somebody specific. They can go after multiple people and it just doesn’t work out.",anime,1kldqev
"Looking for a battle shonen with 24+ chapters I'm in the mood for a battle anime right now but I don't want to watch something that is really short (12 caps) or it has just one short season, I'm not looking for something specific, just good battles and great plot maybe I dont care, with at least +24 chapters (would it be great with 30+ minimum), action/battle shonen not have to be it's main genre, can be isekais, fantasy, mecha, roncom or whatever idc.

"Please recommend me Anime similar to Rascal does not dream I usually watch Shonen, Isekai and Fantasy and just ocassionaly watch other genres. Following a lot of recommendations here, I recently watched Rascal does not dream of Bunny girl Senpai and I was so pleasantly suprised by it. I just loved how mature and real the characters acted. I hate drama and jealousy in romances, so this one just felt right. Espacially in Isekai, the social interactions often seem odd and unrealistic.  So please recommend me more anime me with characters who feel ""real"", with realistic social interactions and MCs similar to Azusawa in Rascal.

"Help me identify a long-lost anime I've been trying to figure out for months (Sci-fi/Dystopian) I've been pathetically browsing MyAnimeList for a while now for this anime I watched. I also tried ChatGPT, Google, and looking through years and years of Netflix history. So if someone can identify this anime, you're officially better than ChatGPT, Google, and my memory. My best guess is I watched it about five years ago, but it could've come out before that, of course.  Here's what I remember:  * I'm pretty sure it was on Netflix but it's not on there anymore * It was Dystopian and Sci-Fi * The main character was female  I only watched the first episode. The first ep had a 20-somethings woman, a man (I believe, but I'm not certain...) and a small robot on a desolate dystopian-like planet. For some reason the man had to go away, maybe in search of food or civilization because this place was horrible. I'm fairly certain the woman had a baby and years and years went by and the child died and the robot broke down, so she was all alone. She got incredibly depressed, and the guy never came back. Oh, and she lived out of a smallish pod like ""ship"". For some reason I'm thinking it was more of a pod than a ship. I cannot stress enough that a lot of time passed, and I think she was on the verge of picking herself up and trying to carry on after the depression of so much loss. I think she might've been immortal, or at least able to live longer than others.  If you're able to help me identify this anime so I can watch it again you're the goat :) Thank you!",anime,1knnd2g

Relatively old anime where a cheery tan girl befriends some kind of star monster? I remember seeing it quite awhile ago  The girl is rather young like 7-10. Tan. Brown hair. Twintails.   Very cheery   Visits the countryside or a beach town or something and goes swimming  Some kind of legend    Encounters a strange star like creature that I think gets bigger and more creepy as things go on?

"Need help of finding the name of the anime I watched years ago What anime is that there's a magic school, a male high school protagonist with a small female fairy-like friend on his side, I only remember he has a schoolmate, a black long hair girl with powers that whenever she opened her mouth, monsters/yokai/ghosts(?) are getting sucked in to be her sustain food and forgotten the others but one episode I remember is the fairy decided to become human human like the mc to attend the school with him too AND I forgotten all the rest, I tried searching online but couldn't find it, pls help 😭🙏",anime,1knztpp
I need help finding an anime The details are really vague and it might not even be real but I remember an anime and I think it was about a club where outside the classroom there was a different world or it might have been in vr or something it was kinda like a desert the characters might have had powers but I dont remember,anime,1knrcgs
"Romance anime suggestion? Okay. So I am obsessed with romance anime. However I have been so disappointed because all the ones I’ve loved so much basically end when they get together. Like the final episode of the show is them finally kissing and maybe you get one clip of them with a family as a credit scene.   Are there any where it shows them getting together, but then continues once they are married/serious? I just want to see high school romance blossom into adult romance, see them have kids, something. Doesn’t have to start with high school kids. I just want a good romance where they actually are together for a lot of it and it isn’t just crushes that bud into a real relationship at the end.   Fruits basket was one of my all time favorites and I wished the made fruits baskets another into an anime as well… I’ve also watched kamisama kiss, Horimiya (really liked this one but wished season 2 was more after high school and not just missing scenes from the first season), apothecary diaries (but that’s less romance and is real plot besides relationships. Which I love that but want more romance and less crushes), Arifureta but that was a bit to harem and cringe for my taste…   Also bonus points if it lasts more than one season or has a ton of episodes. I think that’s a pipe dream but I work from home and often can watch an entire season quickly while I work… typically I watch English dub for that reason, but I’m okay with sub only if it fits the criteria I’m asking for. (For example on how much I can watch. I watched all of OG Naruto, Shippuden, and some of Boruto in about a month or so. Filler and all. I watch for about  8-10 hours every day)  Also okay with anime’s where romance isn’t the main feature but it shows the growth. Like I loved Naruto Shippuden, but I wish there were more scenes with the romance on top of all the plot and fight scenes. Instead of just a few blushes and one off episodes/movies about it.   Thank you! :)  TL;DR: romance anime, as long as possible, where they actually are together and it doesn’t end with them finally kissing. Shows I already watched in the 3rd paragraph.   Edit to add: Thank you everyone for your recommendations! This list is amazing. I appreciate all of you so much for this and will start watching your recommendations now!! Xoxoxoxooxox",anime,1kni6nc

"Looking for a suggestion Hi, I am looking for a suggestion for a new anime.  We just finished Is it Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon and are looking for something new.  Ideally, looking for something on the shorter side, like 1, MAYBE 2 seasons max.

"Looking for an anime of any genre, geared towards adults Hello. What anime would you recommend me trying that has a target demographic of an adult (not hentai, and it doesn't require an adult protagonist, but respects the viewer's intelligence)?   Some that I've enjoyed in the past include Dr. Irabu Ichiro, One Outs, Ping Pong, Evangelion, SE Lain, Flowers of Evil and Kaiji. I've been watching anime for a couple of decades, so obscure is better.   I feel like I'm running the genre dry and when I try anything new like Lazarus, I get tired of the tropes and flat characters in minutes. I tried AI first and it spat out recs that I've tried and can tell were for the youth even after specifying not to.   I don't want to think that I am outgrowing the art, but it is getting harder to find shows that I enjoy.   Thank you!  Edit: Wow. Seriously have to thank you all for so many recommendations. I haven't heard of a good number of these. This is a great subreddit.",anime,1kmejvp

In the first ep we see the dragons body become partially mangled when she trys to use another artifact to try to undo the curse, the MC telling her she cant undo whats been done to her as she flys off and he has to look for her again.  Another part of it was there were two comedic villains, who were short. A dark haired guy obsessed with money, and a timid girl with swirly glasses who followed his lead.

"MAL, Animeplanet etc. on DB size and completeness Hi all, I am generally a MAL, novelupdates, and dramalist user. I split my catalogues of anime and manga in MAL, novels with novelupdates, and live action shows in dramalist. However I am starting to get frustrated as I am unable to add certain manhwa due to non-whitelisted platforms (e.g. Daum in MAL). There are entire forums on this whitelisting blacklisting issue on MAL forums but there is no expansion yet. As such I wanted to ask the community if there are users who are also not able to catalogue some of their favourite anime/aeni/dongman/cartoon/manga/manhwa/manhua/comics etc. due to such restrictions are what are the alternatives you guys come up with? Also is there a platform that is more complete than MAL (I am thinking anime planet but I am not sure about the size of their database size/whitelisting) that has a more comprehensive storage of the works done by artist around the world to make cataloging series I actually completed easier? Other than that, whose recommendations/suggestions are better?

"Recent Anime I can't remember Trying to remember the title of a show I watched only Episode 1 of. It would be a modern show, within the last 6-ish years. typical fantasy environment, the MC is a student at magic high school. He has the worst grades in the entire academy, I can't remember if it was pure academic grades or whether he also had bad magic skills as well, probably both?  Anyways, he's sent to the headmasters office to discuss this, but runs into a young witch who I remember being petite and wearing a giant hat. I think she then makes a deal with him? or kidnaps him? Either way, he goes with her to a giant tree and there's a lizard beastman there and he's the witches' assistant? bodyguard? they're on a team. I also remember the witch was cheeky and sarcastic.  Does this ring any bells? I'm worried my brain has muddled several shows into one in my brain since the show in my memory was generic fantasy LN Shonen slop.

"Trying to find a 90s anime It's been a while but here's what I remember:  1. Two girls were summoned into a world of magic to be star princesses/goddesses, I think 2. Girl A finds her protector almost immediately, Girl B gets assaulted and I think decides she wants to end the world or something  3. There are multiple protectors for each one (something to do with their constellation, I guess). I remember Girl A's first protector was a guy had like super agility or something(wolf star?) while her second protector was a girl with a maroon bracelet that transforms into a gauntlet that gives her super strength. I think a character appears on their foreheads when they access the power in protection of their princess. 4. Girl B's main protector is a very very strong guy, main antagonist, I think, may be manipulating her. I vividly remember a scene where he gut punches someone, then summons his power into his fist, vaporising the guy. 5. I think there was an arc where there were some past protectors of a previous princess, old ones who suddenly transform into their peak levels in exchange for the rest of their lives (à la Genkai) to protect Girl A.

"Prodigy/Intellectualy OP MC series (fantasy). Hello! I'm looking for shows that feature people who are generally considered a prodigy at their work, and the story mainly centers around them **geeking out about said work/hobby.**  Bonus points if  - The MC is younger and proves the adults wrong. (Me, a shitty childhood? How could you tell? Yeah this is just to fill the void left by growing up in a very restrictive environment)  - There's none or a one-sided romance. Specifically the ""I'm too busy geeking out to catch your hints"" trope which I like. Romance subplot is also fine though!  - Fantasy magic setting. I just love escaping from reality. **Or sci fi**.  Great examples are  - ""By the grace of the gods""  - ""7th prince so I can perfect magic"" etc etc   - ""Knight's & Magic""  - ""Ascendance of a Bookworm""  - ""Parallel World Pharmacy""  - ""I shall survive using potions""  - ""7th time loop"" (they became intellectually OP by reincarnating a bunch lol)  - ""Fushi no Kami"" (light novel)    Not quite fitting, but I also loved  - ""Steins;Gate"" (I am mad scientist)  - ""Mushoku Tensei"" (he's a magic prodigy but the show isn't based around that. One of my all time favs)  - ""Reincarnated as a Slime"" (same as above)  - ""Sakamoto Days"" (I liked the vibes of this one and the character dynamics)  **Thanks in advance**.",anime,1klzfnq

I'm pretty picky with possibly undiagnosed ADHD so I'd like an anime that is under 12-13 episodes since I get bored or distracted easily so longer ones are a slog to get through.

No isekai or reincarnation, I just really don't like the millions of reincarnated into a blah blah blah and I'm strangely overpowered type stuff.

"I’m looking for (lesser known) long story-arcs (at least around 45 manga chapters / 4-5 volumes) that received a faithful anime adaptation I’d be grateful if you could recommend me some long story-arcs that received a full, well paced anime-adaptation. (Aside from the very well known examples in popular weekly anime like One Piece / Bleach / Naruto and so on of course.)  The original medium doesn’t really matter. A light novel – adaptation would also be fine, as long as it stays close to the source material.  It doesn’t have to be a complete adaptation if the aforementioned arc is fully covered. I can just continue reading where the anime leaves off.  I always liked long arcs within a larger story that have a lot of built-up and revolve around a specific group of antagonists.  I’d prefer a story with fantasy-elements, but would also be willing to check out more realistic stuff if the adaption is faithful.  Thanks a lot for all your help ;)",anime,1kngcl5

Action/thriller genre preferred Hey everyone, I’ve been watching anime for the past 8 years, so I’ve gone through most of the big, mainstream titles that usually come up in recommendations.

Not really into comedy or super wholesome/slice-of-life shows, but if something in that genre is truly outstanding, I’m open to giving it a shot.

"Why is Mushoku Tensei so hated? I recently ended up in a discussion with a group of people recently talking about some of our favorite anime’s. I brought up that MT was in my top 10 and a one of the people in the group started berating me telling me that the show was trash and I was trash for liking it so much. The argument went on for quite some time. I want to bring up some of the points of the discussion and see what other peoples take on it is.  1: Their argument: The person mentioned that Rudeus was nothing but a pedo because when he died he was 34 (they didn’t know his age but I filled it in) and because of that, when he fell for people in his new life, he was a disgusting pedo perv.  My argument: It’s a common trope in this genre of anime. Examples; By the Grace of the Gods- MC was in his 30’s when he died and fell for an 8 year old. World’s finest assassin- MC was in his 60’s and fell for an 12 year old. Aristocrat’s otherworldly adventure-MC was 18 and was engaged to 2 10 year olds. Many more examples are also available  2: Their argument: It was an author self insert show and that’s what they really want  My argument: Most of fantasy is self insert, that’s the whole point of the genre, so is romance and sci-fi, what’s the point of trying to build a world that you didn’t want to live in. That’s how most fantasy writer’s imagination their worlds so they can make it better for the reader.  3: Their argument: The show is nothing more than the story of a perv trying to force women to do what he wants (really showed how they never even gave the show a real chance)  My Argument: The real story is watching Rudeus grow not only physically but mentally and emotionally too (no other show I’ve watched has done that and I’ve watched hundreds of anime now)  Here’s my theory and final argument. When Rudeus was in his previous life, he never actually matured mentally because he became a shut in at 14. He never had the life experience to grow out of his childish thoughts which is why he still is perverted when he’s in his 30’s, after he is reincarnated, he doesn’t actually start to mature mentally until after the mana disaster when he has to grow up or they will die. That’s when you really start to see the change in him. I have known real shut ins before and they never grow up until they are forced to face life. I knew a 46 year old hermit that hadn’t left his house since he was 15 and still laughed at fart jokes that no adult would laugh at.   My theory about why people hate the show so much is that it is the only isekai where his inner monologue and his spirit self is still his old self which constantly reminds people that he died as an adult.   Let me know if I am wrong with any of my arguments or my theory. I appreciate the feedback.",anime,1knwwme
"Is Anime getting kinda boring? Don't get me wrong, I watch and enjoy anime but lately I'm seeing that the stories are getting repetitive, colors are more vibrant and childish and in general there is less violence and mature themes explored compared to the past where we had awesome shows like the big 3 (Naruto, One Piece, Bleach), Sailor moon, Ranma 1/2, Shiki, Shinsekai Yori, FMA and Death Note. Each show gave us something different like Ninja, Pirates, Shinigami, Gender swap, alchemy or a book that kills people!  I just feel like anime in the past were more mature, had more depth in the story and the colors had a shade which gave them that iconic anime look (IDK how to even express it). I'm just not getting that vibe from today's anime. Sure, we have some good anime here and there but even those are nothing compared to the anime of the golden era. I feel like anime standards are dropping be it in regard to storyline, art, animation and IDK the general vibe comes out more childish non-violent and non-serious  Do you guys agree with me? Now a days I don't even feel like watching anime. Yeah, there is one good show every season that is kind of watchable but still not that compelling!  Do share your opinions on this!",anime,1kmpnr6

"What’s an obscurely unique anime you would recommend to someone who’s seen a shit ton of anime? I tend to binge watch anime when I get off of work and recently I’ve found myself either watching shitty anime or rewatching classics like fmab, soul eater, code geass, samurai champloo, old berserk. I’m older so I tend to gravitate towards more Seinen/mature anime’s but still love my shonen every now and again. What do you recommend!?",anime,1k9ezvj
"Anime with fat characters who aren't just jokes I realized the only two anime I can think of off the top of my head with fat characters who have personalities aside from just ""haha they're fat"" is Dungeon Meshi with Senshi, who you could argue isn't ""really"" fat because he's the standard body type for dwarves, and then Pokemon which has multiple side characters who are fat, like that nerd kid from Sun and Moon and like, a bunch of gym leaders.   So, anyone have any anime with prominent plus size characters who are actual characters and not just walking jokes?",anime,1kb0okj
"Anime that makes you feel like something's ""off"" (no spoilers please I'm looking for shows that have an underlying feel that something isn't quite right, like something's going on behind the scenes that the viewer hasn't quite grasped yet.

"Need more adult type of anime I've loved watching anime since I was a kid, but now that I'm older I want to watch anime that's not based around highschoolers. The funny thing is though that most of the anime that are my favorite are all based around that 😆 like: Drrr!, Soul Eater, FLCL, Romantic Killer, Jujutsu Kaisen. Right now I am mostly obsessed with The Ancient Magus Bride and Black Butler. I also wouldn't mind some new mangas to read as well for the summer, until university starts up again. There are also some animes that I just couldn't get through, which was Violent Evergarden, Evangelion, NANA, The Way of the Househusband.

anime where they mainly use guns for combat im kind of tired of seeing ninjas with big swords or mages with insane abilities doing spell fights. need some anime where they have **realistic** gun combat. realism is important if somebody gets shot they have to get shot(obviously there are kevlar suits that allow the person to minimize damage. point is I want them to react realistically to bullets. so nothing such as characters living after getting their head blown please) and I don't want there to be characters with insane running speed dodging all the bullets from a 5 thousand+ rpm M134 minigun. because obviously that would be unrealistic too  if they use machine guns or heavier guns in general thats even better. but it is not required,anime,1k7kbw9

I don't like oversexualation of characters, and I don't like ones with teen humor, or where they are in secondary school, these do have a role in the history of anime as they are from amazing artists and story tellers, but to me they are just for the younger generic generations, and don't add up to my enjoyment as much.

"Looking for A manga I forgot the name of. As the Title is suggesting I am looking for a manga that I read about a year or 2 ago that I cant seem to find.  Sorry if this isn't the subreddit for this but its what I found when I googled  Story-  The manga is about out main character who is a high-school student, on the outside he's kind of normal but he's really arrogant and self-centered in his inner thoughts. He believes that he has opened the ""love route"" for two of his female friends (His childhood friend and Class President), but in reality when they both go to confess, they confess they actually like his best friend (The star Baseball player).  So now he has to help one of them seduce his best friend so he can get the loser to himself.  But later that day his best friend tells him that he also has someone he likes, the quite library girl, and that he wants his help to seduce her.  Now at his wits end and unsure what to do he goes to meet the Library girl who ends up confessing that she like him.

"Anime that deals with trauma/PTSD in the daily sense of it I'm looking for something that portrays trauma as it affects the small parts of life. Like, about how the fear clings to situations it doesn't fit in. About how you can be eating dinner with your friends and the way someone's legs block you from getting out of your seat makes you irrationally afraid. But it would be inappropriate to make too much of a fuss about who sits where (or to let it show that you feel afraid) so you just sit there passively with the fear eating at the back of your mind. Or like how you return to your daily life and everything is the same but nothing feels the same. The paranoia that gets into your mindset without you realizing. (Like casually asserting to people things like ""you should never trust anyone"" or ""your rights don't mean anything in the face of force"" with the same sense of natural convinction as you'd have telling them that the sky is blue or the Earth is round.)  Whenever something like that happens I always feel very silly and alone, so it would be nice to see it depicted in some sort of media. I feel like I most often see trauma in media in the sense of a character gets triggered by something directly related to the event and then has an immersive flashback, which is something which can happen to some people with trauma, but mine's never been that loud",anime,1k3waey

"Looking for hopeful animes that has a theme of ""it gets better"". I apologize for my broken English, it's not my first language.

This doesn't have to be the core of the anime, just the part of it is more than enough for me.  The reason why I'm asking for this particular suggest is because, I've recently grown tired of bleak and depressing animes that just don't get better no matter what, like Texhnolyze, Plastic Memories, and Cyberpunk Edgerunners.

"An anime where magic is deeply integrated into every aspect of the world? Hey, the title is a bit vague, but I am looking for an anime where magic is DEEPLY embedded in society. For example, people in that world do not use ovens or gas stoves but instead cook their meals with magic. There's also no need for laundry because it can be done with magic, and cleaning works the same way. There's no need for a waste container because you can just make the trash disappear into nothingness. Instead of ordinary vehicles, they have magic-powered ones, or there may be no vehicles at all, as people simply fly, teleport, or use super speed to get wherever they want to go. It’s a world where non-fatal diseases and minor injuries are a thing of the past. Singers improve their voices with magic, performers have magical beings as their cast, chefs can cook an entire course in an instant, artists can create profound and complex drawings without lifting a finger, builders are able to construct massive buildings without the use of heavy machinery or manual labor, etc.  Basically, it’s a world where they take FULL advantage of magic, not just use it for combat. A world where magic is taken for granted and found in every corner of people’s daily lives, that sort of thing.

"Are there any animes with a storytelling style similar to Durarara!!? I'm looking for animes where, at the beginning of the series, the main character (and by extension, the audience) is confronted with a series of seemingly unrelated strange events. As the story progresses, those events gradually start to make sense through multiple character perspectives. Ever since I finished *Durarara!!* years ago, I’ve been craving this kind of storytelling again.  Here are a few animes with similar premises that I’ve already seen:  * **Baccano!** – Probably the *closest anime* to what I’m looking for. It shares the same author as *Durarara!!*, so this one’s kind of cheating. * **Steins;Gate** – Watched this a long time ago and it’s one of my personal favorites. Starts the series with a huge question mark on what's really happening before unpacking it in the end.  * **Attack on Titan** – Probably the most mainstream example. Less on the multiple perspectives part, more emphasis on subtle foreshadowing and big reveals.  * **Hunter x Hunter (Chimera Ant Arc)** – Specifically during the final raid. There are multiple battles happening simultaneously, each with random curve balls that are actually related to the other battles.  Non-animes with a similar approach:  * **Dark (Netflix Series)** – Probably the closest overall to *Durarara!!* A sci-fi time travel mystery where the first few episodes are full of disconnected events and mysteries that slowly converge as the series goes. * **Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes** / **River** – Both are time travel themed movies from the same director. The early randomness gradually becomes coherent as the timeline unfolds.  I just realized that a lot of these involve time travel. Still, I’m more interested in the storytelling aspect in how seemingly random events that weave together from multiple perspectives into a satisfying conclusion.

I’m looking for an anime like frieren beyond journeys end where there’s action sprinkled in with an incredible story. Preferably one with a romance subplot or at least a love interest. kinda like Jobless reincarnation (without the creepy stuff). I like when the action is put on a back burner until necessary unlike some anime where it’s straight in your face every single episode.,anime,1kio06s
Spicer Anime My wife really likes the more spicer anime’s that have a lot of fan service but still have a story to them. Highschool dxd is a perfect example of what we are looking for.

"Trying to find Combat anime with genuine sword play Been trying to look for any anime for quite awhile that has good sword choreography and is realistic with its sword combat respecting the logic of sword fighting. I’m a person who got into boffer and has done a small amount of hema before I couldn’t pay for the insurance that is required to participate, this has resulted in me learning alot of actual sword technique like voiding, feints, high cross, watching for openings in any stance, and distancing. What always takes me out of any anime with sword fighting is that it always tends to either glorify it making a encounter between one person and 5 or a demon seem reasonable or the character compensates with magic. Demon slayer and sword art online ironically are the first things I find when I search up “good sword fighting anime” too which is obviously not what I’m looking for. I’ve watched the start of rurouni kenshin, Vinland saga, and samurai champloo as well. So far the closest thing I’ve managed to find in terms of realistic choreography especially in the opening sequence and in one on one sword fighting encounters is old country bumpkin to master swordsman, it’s not realistic in its setting and it’s story feels mid but the main character has ideals that I find reasonable for a sword fighter to have in a fantasy setting and it takes moves like half stepping and stepping through wide moves into consideration atleast in episodes 1-3, the latest episode 4 seems only reasonable in a vacuum.",anime,1kdtwon

Then there was a water guy that could evolve into an aqua demon warrior, also a big yellow cat character that evolved into a lion warrior.

"Anime for married couple in their 30s? Hi. I would like to get a little bit deeper into japanese (or possibly chinese, doesn't matter) animation.  So far I liked:  * 91 Days (mafia story in Italy during alcohol prohobition) * Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 1-2 (with the exception of the unwatchable mechs only episode). Didn't like other GotS that much other than the original movie. * Biao Ren: Blades of the Guardians (chinese, sitting on top of my quality list right now)  Not interested in:  * Endless shows about will-they-won't-they relationship * Shows or movies where they overuse nudity or barbarism for nothing else other than the animator's fetish. Violence and romance is welcome, but you know there is a line for self-serving, otherwise pointless overuse of both. I have my own western shows for that, I'm looking for something that is ""wife compatible"" and Invincible / The Boys are definitely not, so the same applies to eastern animation. * Essentially endless shows that run on way too long. * Please don't downvote, but ""children's show"". Things like YuGiOh, Naruto. Make it mature, there are likely plenty of content out there for a slightly older audience who are more interested in heavier themes and more compact but well written stories, in the form of limited series (91 Days is a prime example).  I was never big on anime, sure I watched Pokémon in the 90s as a kid, Inuyasha, and whatever went on at the time in the morning cartoon marathon on weekends. My wife however didn't watch any so far, other than Blades of the Guardians. So please consider a sort of... ""troyan horse"" approach (I mean, Grogu sold Star Wars to many :D) make us like the concept before the army is unleashed on us if you catch my drift.",anime,1k23iyt

"Isekai manga where the MC doesn't have a 'cheat skill', or 'secretly OP skill that people overlook', or any other form of power wankery (be it for combat, magic, farming, money-making or other) that trivializes all problems he comes across? Only one I read recently that I can think of was a manga where the gimmick was that the protag had a car and could go back and forth between the worlds by driving really fast (back to the future rules ig). At no point he gets any powers, as far as I read, other than ramming his car into things and being able to purchase convenience food in japan in between trips.  Other than recently, Konosuba and Combatants Will Be Dispatched (AKA Konosuba again) also fit the bill. Kazuma does get powers but they are pretty minor, and everyone in his party who have major powers come with limitations or drawbacks  Inuyasha as well though I feel that one is cheating because it came before Isekai became a genre with defined tropes  Alternatively, I wouldn't mind if the character is OP in a way that isn't the main focus of the story and doesn't get in the way of storytelling. Isekai Shikkaku for example, where the protag is pretty much immortal and wins 'fights' in a single move, but the manga isn't about the fights themselves, it's about getting him to care about doing something since he's comically depressed.",anime,1kfubhu

"A manga that doesn't flub its ending I want a finished manga that doesn't fuck up it's ending, doesn't rush it, doesn't ruin anything that the manga built up that leaves it's readers satisfied  So many manga I've read that start out strong, had good arcs, and amazing buildup, just absolutely drop the ball at the end, and retroactively diminishes everything that came before, demon slayer, MHA, my dress up doll, the promised Neverland   Almost all of the ones I feel are the worst is they end too fast, never giving the time to let the story breathe because they think it needs to end 15 arcs at the same time, or they go from fighting like a lower Middle management boss to going to Fight the entire board of directors simultaneously, or they just resolve the romantic plot in like 2 chapters out of nowhere and end the series   I also don't like it when it takes 70 chapters for the final arc to end. As my previous point, if it can end just a small handful of arcs in an appropriate amount of chapters while not taking away anything that came before  And I don't want anything that de-powers it's hero, if a story is about something Getting better or stronger or more powers, the absolute worst thing the author can do is end the series with them becoming just a normal person at the end, completely depowered, like it's saying my investment in their power growth was wasted.  I'd much rather an ""the adventure continues"" ending than a ""the hero you spent 300 chapters following becomes a normal everyday un-powered salaryman"" ending unless the story does some serious heavy lifting to make it work   Endings are hard, I get it, but there is a razors edge where greatness lies, and that's where I want to be directed   As for genre, I'm pretty open, action, adventure, romance, slice of life whatever really.

It was a sword and sorcery with at least one guy and one girl. Guy had the ability to essentially go berserk and become super strong, but it hurts him. She warns him it's like his last time or something. He does it and dies anyway.   I'd like to read or watch this some day, I was trying to rent Nightwalker and this was in the vhs case instead. Damn blockbuster lol.   It is 100% not Berserk or Ninja Scroll. Going to check out Record of Lodoss War and potentially it's sequel.",anime,1k7r1tb

(Don’t worry I’m 100% open to sub only anime, as I’m actively trying to improve my ability to read and follow subs)  So yeah, hit me with some spooky!

Some examples I liked are -  Favs:  Mo dao zu hi Link click Heavens official blessing  Sk8 the infinity  Yuri on ice  Geto/gojo jjk  Buddy daddies   Ones I liked but wasn’t crazy about:  Cherry magic  Given  Twilight out of focus   Basically I just like the dynamic of two guys being super important to each other where it’s obvious there’s more there. It doesn’t have to be confirmed or anything and can just be vibes or undertones.

There was definitely something unusual or special about her—perhaps she was a robot or something along those lines.

"Large ensemble animes with different characters fighting/maneuvering to become a ruler? There's an Anime/Franchise called **Queen's Blade** I really like, now obviously the real appeal of that series is the heavy fanservice, but aside from that I enjoyed the plot vehicle for it, where there's an open tournament to decide who is going to be the next Queen and you have dozens of characters of all different types competing, each for their own reason to become a ruler, and you get to explore their individual journeys, competition with other fighters, and of course their relationship with each other.  Fanservice is totally optional, I just want to see an anime that doesn't just have a single ""obvious who should win"" protagonist fighting with or against other protagonists, but with higher stakes than just ""champion of a fighting tournament"".  One of the big reasons I liked the way Queen's Blade did it was it wasn't *just* a series of fighting matches, but also focused on the journey as well.

"Anime series like Evangelion, 86, Devilman Crybaby, Violet Evergarden I know they’re disparate animes, but I haven’t watched a lot. I guess I’ve always just been able to identify the vibes and themes I like. Not sure if anyone can help correlate similarities between these. I like good imagery and symbolism as well as consistent storytelling that hints towards contemporary moral topics. Aside from this only ever watched Dragon Ball up to Z and a bit of Naruto, which were fun but not quite the same as what I got out of the aforementioned animes. I did also see Dandadan and while quite fun with some nice character moments, it didn’t give me that gut punch of emotion I like feeling. Cowboy Bebop is something I’m thinking about watching so feel free to comment on thoughts about that one as well. And if anyone is a video game fan, I do play a lot of JRPGs, so I’m not fully unfamiliar with this style of storytelling.

"Anime where the characters go so fast that they ELONGATE HORIZONTALLY Recommend me anime where the character dashes/flies into the enemy so fast that they start elongating horizontally due to the massive speed they accumulate (they HAVE TO ELONGATE).  A few good examples I can think of is in the Luffy vs Kaido fight, where Luffy flung into kaido to perform a G4 gattling gun or in MHA when the glasses tech guy was flying into the masked guy. I want to see more anime in which characters elongate like that.",anime,1kd9tnd

"Looking for an anime(or manga) with a specific kind of character Or manhua, manhwa, or even light novel. I'm not super picky haha.  I'm trying to find a story with a character (doesn't have to be the protagonist but I've only seen it with protagonists) that has 3 qualities: 1. They are competent/excel in something. They can be smart, strong, skilled, good with people, etc. They don't have to be op. 2. They act standoffish, aloof, blunt, rude, sarcastic, and/or snarky.  3. Somehow they acquire a gaggle of good-natured, maybe shenanigan-loving, ~~idiots~~ people around them. Maybe from means unknown to them, maybe because they're unexpectedly kind, maybe because they arranged it.  Anime I've watched with a character like this: -Saiki from the Disastrous Life of Saiki K -Senku from Dr Stone -Sunako from the Wallflower (...kinda?) -Nozaki from Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun (...kinda?)  Other places I've seen this: -Cale from the Lout of the Count's Family  Pls pls pls don't give me a harem pls. Any other genre is fine!",anime,1kaegar

"Animated media that heavily feature a specific real-world location? Easiest thing to comes to mind is how Steins; Gate very much revolves the Akihabara neighborhood, directly including streets, buildings, and some shops.

I've tried Princess Mononoke and some other Studio Ghibli style stuff but it wasn't for me. Full Metal Alchemist was suggested to me and it was better but still didn't quite hit the mark.  I like the darker, sci-fi, dystopian style stuff for Anime I think. With some depth.  People have suggested Cowboy Bebop, Armitage III, and Ghost in the Shell to me as well and from what I've seen so far, the latter two seem like strong suggestions, on paper at least.

Suddenly serious anime with giant robots piloted by children Trying to remember an anime I saw probably 10 years ago? I remember it started out as a fun “kids sign up to pilot giant robots and save the world!” But (spoiler?) then they find out the OTHER giant robot is always piloted by alternate earth kids and the loser’s entire world is destroyed? And (spoiler?) after the first fight the pilot kid and other kids are standing on top of the robot and one kid playfully *jokingly* pushes the pilot kid and the kid falls off the robot and DIES. At first it’s “wtf he killed him?!” Then they find out the kid that pilots the robot uses their entire life force to do it so if they win the earth is saved but they die. So kid was dead before he was pushed. That’s all I remember and I think that was just the first or second episode. Anyone know what the heck I’m talking about?,anime,1kjrm5p

"Anime where adventure is way more of a focus than fighting, with a lot of variety. I'm someone who enjoyed original Dragon Ball way more than when it morphed into Dragon Ball Z. The main reason is I get fed up with ""villain of the season"" arcs (DBZ arcs are literally named after it's villains) where the whole focus of the plot is getting stronger, beating the bad guy, then rinse and repeat because an *even stronger* bad guy always shows up. I don't want really formulaic Scooby-Doo style plotlines where I can tell you the outcome before the opening credits even finish.  What made the early Dragon Ball so much better in my opinion was it never focused on the fights (maybe by the time of the World Martial Arts Tournament plotline) but it was much more in it's roots as an homage to Journey to the West where the goal was to go on an adventure, and every episode just about was new places, new events, new characters, and new challenges. I don't want anymore anime about super powerful characters who can beat the pants off anyone (nor do I want lampshades on this like One Punch Man). I just want adventure and to feel like the heroes are progressing towards something.  Also please nothing like One Piece where 500 episodes in and they are no closer to finding the thing the whole series is focused on. I'm also 39, so I'd appreciate an anime a little more mature than shonen aimed at tweens.",anime,1khx7jo
"Dororo 2019 Hey everybody. I'm watching Dororo from 2019 for the second time, and I'm awestruck of how good it is. The action is cool, but mostly the way hyakkimaru reacts and handles the way he gets each body part back and how Dororo guides him through it is just so wholesome. I'm at the episode where he has his hearing back and learns to cope with it. And how the singing girl from the village with the orphans soothes him. It all had a strong emotional impact the first time I watched it. And it does so now, too. Are there similar anime out there that you know of, that gets these sad, yet wholesome emotions out of you?

"Looking for a stereotypical edgy anime. I'm looking for the cringiest, most ecchi, comedic anime you got. Another big plus if they have people with heterochromia, or nekomimi, or any other classic anime components. Yes, I think the whole animal girl concept is cute/funny and IDGAF. I watch anime to cringe and laugh my a\*\* off from the corniness.  For some background, my hands down favorite anime so far (relatively new to it) is prison school, and also loved Highschool DxD. Awkward situations, out of pocket reactions/facial expressions, pure idiocracy. Loved the hilarious situations that came up in Highschool DxD around nudity, though at times it was really too much (ngl most of the time was completely unnecessary), and died laughing at the facial expressions from prison school.  I also could care less about the story line, its all about the characters for me. Also would much rather have it dubbed, but if people are raving about a show with subs Ill take it.  Hit me with your best, or worst, just make me cringe and laugh 'til I cry lmao.",anime,1kf1lvg

"How to Deal With Burnout? Well, it’s finally happened.   I’ve reached the burnout stage.  I started watching anime last June, and for the past 9 months I’ve been like an unstoppable train on railroad “binge” with a one way ticket to 100 watched series.  However, the past month, 60 anime deep, I’m finally starting to slow down.  I used to grind through like 5 episodes a day. The last few months it turned into an episode or two a day. For the past couple weeks, I’d get through maybe an episode every other day.  Now I’ve gone 14 days having watched one episode total.  The thing that sucks is that I actually am enjoying one of the shows I’m currently watching (*Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken*), and I want to finish it. I don’t mind Re:Zero either, but it’s discouraging knowing I’m 45 episodes into it and still have 20 or so left to get through.  I haven’t watched a series that I’ve *loved* in a while; Heavenly Delusion or Oshi no Ko were the last two I felt that way about, and I watched those probably 3 months ago.  Not really sure what to do, because there’s tons of shows I’m still dying to watch, but I’m just struggling to have the motivation to keep grinding.  Any suggestions?",anime,1kah9sf

"Animes like The Big O and Lazarus (for a non-anime lover)? Hello, I never considered myself an anime lover, so I'm a bit out of my depth here.  I recently watched The Big O, and fell in love with the show, completing its 26 episodes way too fast. I've heard that The Big O was more catered to Western audiences, and the art style seems to reflect that (?), which really helped me enjoy the series more as I'm not used to the current, modern anime style.  I've also been enjoying the new Lazarus anime and am eagerly waiting for new episodes.  I am planning to watch Cowboy Bepop in the meantime (due to the creator's connections to Lazarus and a fairly interesting premise). But would love more recommendations! Thank you!  Things I liked about The Big O:  * Film Noir * Cool protagonist who never loses his cool * Beautiful femme fatale * More western (?) animation style * Dystopian future * Retrofuturism * Existentialism and philosophical undertones * Conspiracies and mysteries * Mecha aspect was cool but not my main priority > But I appreciated it for its dynamic action * Amazing soundtrack  Things I liked about Lazarus:  * Cyberpunk setting * Biohacking (in a way through the drugs) * Cool protagonist who never loses his cool * Philosophical undertones * Conspiracies and mysteries * Dynamic action * Amazing soundtrack",anime,1k8hmaf

"An Anime where the MC closes himself from the World because he finds it too depressing ? The visual image that I have of it would be the MC or any character, closing himself in a floating ball of an impenetrable material, to entirely close himself from the world  After learning how the world works, what life is, what the universe is, anything  it's just an image, it could not be litteraly that but done in a figurative way  I kinda like for exemple how >!in Parasyte the hero slowly begins to understand how everything is tied to emotions, how things not really mean anything, and how he becomes a bit insensitive to what's around him, but not in an edgy way or anything, just in a resignation way!<  But the main image is the character closing himself from the world after realising or knowing what it is (or just because of how he feels about life/existence/the universe)  Is there anything like this that would exist, litteraly or metaphorically ?

"Remembering a 90s anime please help Hi there,  Details will be very limited on this as I was very young and watching the TV from the top of stairs in my uncles room. UK based but uncle had access to cable. Pretty sure it was a movie.  Watched this in mid 90s - 2000 I think, story consisted of humans being near extinction; hiding in the last mega city surrounded by desert.   Protagonist was male, vaguely recall long blonde hair but could be misremembering. Initially was on the side of the humans in the city, went on some sort of expedition into a cavern filled with bats.   At some point the protagonist was in some sort of liquid filled pod, setting was an open sky section of the cavern with small moat and greenery. Being talked at by someone else (no idea)  In the end the protagonist switched sides I believe and was trying to destroy the mega city. From poor memory I feel he was in some sort of mech / suit  For the life of me I can't remember any other enemies but assume aliens/mutants  I will take no offence , these details are super sketchy but just trying to find my clues to what I watched (can't ask uncle as estranged from family too but not due to anime hobby!)  Thanks 🙏",anime,1kjd46j

"Any creative anime like MHA and JJBA? I'm highly instered in anime with such creativity as Jojo's Bizzare Adventure and My Hero Academia(Boku No Hero), even MHA: Illegals, spin-off. Those quirks/stands power had my mind blown. I guess I could say the same for One Piece. I really loved those unlikely OP powers and the creativity behind to make a ""bad"" power become a great power with the right owner, like Luffy, Jolyne, Ida, even Midoriya using gear to amplify his powers like the airshot. Maybe even make a great power become even stronger, like Todoroki. Abstract concepts are also good, like Star and Stripe. JJBA stands also stand out bc sometimes it may be confusing what the stand is really doing in the perspective of who is affected by it, bc sometimes there multiple ways to come that result like aging could be an effect of time going faster for a single person, a single space or it can even be an illusion. JJBA also shines in problem solving despite how confusing it can be to undestanding whats the true effect of the enemy power. I want other animes that have that creativity, to go further than common uses of well known powers.",anime,1kfmilw

"Help me find this fantasy anime I never finished This might be a hard one to find, it must be only about two years ago I was watching it.

It was some kind of fantasy vibe, can't remember any Isekai plot. Also thighs. She was training to be some kind of magician I believe, and something to do with crafting - maybe transmutation, faint memory of some kind of magic circle? I think they had like a group that where going out exploring or doing a dungeon - something similar but they where preparing for quite a while like many episodes before they went. A strange memory of them fighting(training?) and making like a tent or hut on the beach? BTW did I mention thighs?   Well that's all I got...

"Anime with action and fast pacing that does not have these common shonen aspects: I am drawn out of the shonen animes because of what feels like childish dialogue. I dont mean childish in a bad way, I mean it literally as in the characters say ""cool"" things that sound like the lines were written by a 12 year old me.   And the stereotypical characters that dont react like normal people but rather like a hero envisioned by a 12 year old me.   And then there are the infodumps or expositions that dont fit in the story but rather  give the feeling that they were shoehorned in.  To give some examples of what I am talking about I will give examples from the first few episides of Jujutsu Kaisen since I just started watching it. Minor spoilers for first few episodes below.  The main character just found out that monsters are real and got into a fight with one and almost died and his friends almost died. Yet there is no emotion no surprise and he speaks about and accepts this new reality as if it was just another trivial thing like finding out that the price of coca cola in the local store has increased by 10 cents.  This type of nonchalance is common to protagonists in shonen. Gon and Luffy also have this trait.  And then the exposition or ""telling and not showing"". I dont have anything against telling if it fits the situation. For instance if you have a teacher character telling a student character information, it fits. That interaction is something that could and likely would happen. But when it is 2 teachers saying things clearly meant for the listener, it does not fit.  Like if a math teacher says to his student ""1 plus 1 is 2"". It makes sense.  But if two math teachers are speaking and one says ""one plus one is two"" and the other replies "" that is correct, and our student can already calculate that, so soon he will also know that two plus one is three"".  In Jujutsu K something like this happened.  Then there is the exposition that the characters do when they speak to the bad guys like the woman student in Jujutsu after throwing the nails into the curse told it ""to take them out or my cursed energy will seep into you through them"". And then it did and the monster was destroyed.",anime,1k9j1em

In recent years barely watched anything as nothing new seems to excite me, and browsing through the ""TOP 100 ANIME EVER"" fails to grab me as well.  \- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Genres I **like**: Action, Adventure, Mystery, light Comedy or Drama  Genres I **dislike**: Isekai, Ecchi, Romance, Slice of Life, Sports or Music anime, anything Magical Girl or Mecha etc.  Actively **dislike a lot of common anime tropes**, like showing the power of friendship or the protagonist being revealed to be basically chosen by god (the plot) to become the most powerful thing in existence at series end. Keeping that in mind:  **Favourite anime**: Made in Abyss, Hunter x Hunter, Attack on Titan, Kaiji  Some anime I **liked**, but don't love: Ergo Proxy, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, Inuyashiki, Jujutsu Kaisen, Mob Psycho, Baki, Demon Slayer  Anime I **didn't enjoy** and dropped:  Monster (started AMAZING then quickly became incredibly boring with the episodic formula with little plot progress i felt)  Evangelion (felt very contrived and the main cast was honestly some losers.

"Help me find: anime with lots of mass casualties and modern samurai fighting Hi,  Maybe I watched this 10 years ago. I think it was either a movie or short series. It was relatively modern as I remember the visuals were great. Basically there were these suits or armors and people were maybe morphing into them in some way and had super speed and power. They resembled like very modern samurai armor and it was mostly sword fighting.    Not sure about this, but I think normal people didnt see them, but were definitely affected by their power and there were lots of casualties around the fight. In general I remember it was gory and lots of people dying around  Setting was modern cities.    I think the anime started with a slow-mo super speed fight between two of the fighters and one killing the other. I think it was around a bridge.

Anime that feels like a beat em up or fighting game come to life? I'm a huge fan of Beat Em Up Games like Double Dragon and River City Ransom. I just saw that trailer for the new Fatal Fury game and it made me really want to watch an anime that has the vibe of an old school beat em up or fighting games like Fatal Fury or Street Fighter. I spent a good bit trying to search up thinking that trailer was for a new Fatal Fury anime like they're doing with Guilty Gear and was kind of disappointed that it was just a trailer for the game. I know there have been adaptations of said games but are there any modern animes that have this kind of vibe? I'd prefer modern so it can be something that's new that I can watch weekly or at least find a couple seasons of. English dub is preferred if you can find one with a dub as well.,anime,1k6rakn

Only saw a couple clips of it and I'll try my best to describe it, hopefully someone recognizes it (also adding spoiler tags just in case)   If I'm not wrong it's somewhat of a bl? Both of them were in high school if I'm not mistaken, one of the character is slightly feminine? Might be a kouhai or the senpai (?) he's shorter (maybe) (i think he have a dark blondish hair?) The other guy is taller with black hair, I remember a scene where they went on a ""date"" At the cinema, the black hair guy isn't gay(?) But he still went on the date. Okay this is where it's gonna get tricky because I'm not sure if I just created it myself or it actually appeared in the anime. The black hair guy was staring at the blonde guy instead of watching the movie, and the blonde guy said something about kissing(?) I'm not sure if they ended up together or not.   And that's all I remember, legit everything I can put into words. Also the animation style is a bit similar to summertime rendering and the yuzuki family's four sons.

I do understand that Im not giving a lot of info here so if theres not enough to work with I get it.   The scene was there was a single strong man defending a doorway in what was likely a castle of some kind. He was defending against three evil beings, possibly large dogs or wolves. For whatever reason he could not let them get through the doorway. The man is clothed in normal cloth clothing at first. During the fight one of the  wolves latches on to the man going for the kill. After a moment the wolf is thrown back revealing the man was wearing armor underneath the whole time. This event signals a shift in the scene where the man begins to have the upper hand.  The man may have had a round metal shield but I am not certain on that point. That's all I remember unfortunately.

I haven't seen a ton of romance anime. I've seen A Silent Voice, Your Name, Horimiya, Your Lie In April, Kaguya Sama Love is War, Charlotte, The Flower We Saw That Day, Chuunibyou, and most recently Kaichou Wa Maid Sama.

Good for a quick burst of feels), and they ranged from boring to slightly interesting. I did like the emotion in some of them though.

"Suggestions for someone that doesn't really watch anime Suggestions for someone that doesn't really watch anime. But ideally not just the massive ones that would be recommended to literally anyone that's 'new'? I am not 'new' to anime, i just am fairly selective and I haven't liked most of the big ones aside from Fullmetal, Akame, and Inuyasha. Basically if it was on US TV at night, or its one of the ones *everyone* knows, ive probably tried it already.  TLDR at the bottom, but appreciate if you read the full context.   Gonna give brief examples of things ive liked in the past, i dont think anything should be considered a spoiler but hey if it is tel me and ill edit the post.  Ive been going through a bit of an unexplained depressive period in life despite that on paper everything is probably the best its ever been.  Something about the bright colors i guess has called me back to anime for a bit, which I havent watched since I was maybe 16 (Currently 24)  As a a like, 13 year old kid, i *adored* Familiar of Zero, was the first anime i ever watched that wasnt inuyasha or something else on american tv. Even then i really didnt like the fanservicey bits, theyve always made me a bit uncomfortable and moreso the older i get, but I can tolerate it if i like whats going on otherwise. Specifically character dynamics. I watched Zero because Saito was absolutely hilarious as a sarcastic asshole and the sweet moments were really sweet, especially the season finales. I kept trying to find something like that for a while but not much really compared so i fell off of anime.  As a kid i watched Magical Index for a bit for the same reason, but i think season 2 ramped of the fanservicey/haremy elements and it just turned me off.  GATE, the one with the japanese military going into another world, not whatever Steins is, was the same thing. Absolutely adored season 1 just to be really disappointed by 2 and not finish it.  I got recommended I Parry Everything recently and that kind of sucked me back in. Im only 5 episodes in but im afraid to finish it without something else lined up. Normally im not a fan of something goofy like a gimmick character, but the relationship between the female lead and the dude is a real treat. (I also have a real personal weakness for girls crying that anime tends to exaggerate further, it like, hits me straight in the protective instinct. Even moreso now that im a dad.) I'd almost dropped the show until episode i think 2 when the girl started to cry and that kinda hooked me to give it more of a chance. I really hope the relationship between them stays platonic though.    I mentioned liking this to my one anime-friend and they told me 'youre gonna laugh at me when i tell you this title, but give it a try. ""How to love your elf bride"" - youll like it.' And then i binged the entire thing last night and may be slightly emotionally broken. Id never click something with that name in a million years on my own, and i dont really tend to watch pure romance stuff, but that was awesome. Its had me genuinely considering starting the written works in the setting.  Fantasy is definitely a major bonus, as is the 'classic' type of anime style with the more vibrant colors, im a huge fantasy nerd and the lighter color schemes have an insane effect on my mood. The issue is im kind of a snob with entertainment in general, i tend to be hard to please, but if one or two things really hooks me - a main character i really like or relate to for example - i can stomach a lot.   I cant particularly recall liking anything else.  Tldr: have liked I Parry Everything, Archdemon's Dilemma, Index (season 1), Gate (season 1 only), and Familiar of Zero. Dislike but can tolerate fanservice moments *if* i really like other elements. Fantasy preferred but if its isekai it has to be *really* good. If it was on us tv in the 2000s ive probably seen it, and if its one of the massive ones everyone knows, i promise a friend has made me try it at some point.   As a final aside, i havent really had any friends into anime since highschool so if anyone would wanna dm me itd be cool to have someone to talk to about this stuff! I got nobody to talk to really about how the last one broke me!",anime,1kdzq3o

"Trying to find a Comedy SoL Manga based on the first scene I remember Unsure if it has an anime adaptation as I read the manga.  I'm 90% sure it was a comedy manga (possibly 4 koma) released 2014 or later as I usually read these on breaks from work.  The main cast is at least 2 girls, probably more as the manga continues. For this prompt I'll call them Girl A, a more out going girl, and Girl B, a more stoic intimidating girl.  The scene I remember is near the beginning. It's the start of the school year and there's this random boy. Girl A comes and asks for his number to put in her phone and he gets embarrassed from that. Then sees that she's asking every classmate so it was just to build a contact list.  Girl A then gets to Girl B and asks for her phone number but Girl B says she doesn't have a phone because her dad doesn't let her have one. Girl A can't believe this and insists on going over to Girl B's house.  At Girl B's house, Girl A meets Girl's B's father who says the reason he doesn't let her have a phone is because he doesn't want her getting a boyfriend or something. Both girls find this ridiculous. Girl A then pulls the dad aside and goes 'but without a phone, she won't be able to call for help. And then she might be -whisper whisper whisper-'. The dad then turns around and tells Girl B they're getting her a phone.  Back to the classroom the next day and the boy is approached by Girl B asking for his number and he comments he's having deja vu.     I remember that sequence so well, but can't remember what the characters look like or the title of the manga.",anime,1katqg1

"Can anyone recommend me some animes that will be a good fit for me? So I'm about 5 years into animes and feel like I've run out of things to watch so am in need of recommendations.  I usually start with animes then move on to its corresponding manga or ln if I'm really invested.  Comedy is the #1 priority.  I feel like this is almost a must have.  It almost feels like a slog to watch through anything without comedy, though there are a few exceptions like with really good stories such as ascendance of a bookworm.  I feel like fanservice is pretty important for me.  I found that animes don't have to be very deep to keep me entertained if it has fanservice.  Although I find it really difficult to sit through fanservice animes without comedy.  In terms of genre, I really like isekais, romantic comedies, slice of life, and mahou shoujo (only with comedy).  tho i'm not opposed to venturing outside these genre if there are gems waiting to be found.  In terms of characters, I like lolis.  They're cute  I suppose I'll list the animes that I do enjoy as reference and what I did not really enjoy.  My top favorite animes are to love ru and prisma illya (preferred slice of life s1 and 2 much more than s3+, happy loli > stressed and beat up loli).  This list consist of animes that are amazing but not favorites: konosuba, the legendary hero is dead, zero no tsukaima, tensura, mushoku, ascendance, alya/roshidere (mainly for yuki), tearmoon empire, kaguya-sama, isekai ojisan, hitori bocchi, gabriel dropout, eromanga sensei, my sister can't be this cute, demon girl next door, combatants will be dispatched, cautious hero, blend s, average isekai, 80k isekai, toaru railgun, toaru accelerator.  Completed animes that I felt was kinda bad but not terrible enough to drop.  quintessential quintuplets, onimai, kiss x sis, is this a zombie, heaven's lost property, archdemon's dilemma, ,toaru index (cute lolis were only thing that carried me to s3 where acqua was fun to watch.  good lord touma is boring), vending machine isekai.  Animes that I couldn't get past the first few ep due to boredom  freiren, strike the blood (not too sure where the comedy is even tho the series is supposed to have comedy), reincarnated as a sword, in another world w smartphone, eminence in shadow.  **Dislikes:**  horror  gintama (series feels far too overwhelming.  might need to wait till i retire before i can think about getting into it).  main female leads cannot have oppai's (i simply don't like anything too large, it's visually annoying.  lala from to love ru is ok.  but alya from roshidere is getting excessive).  female leads shouldn't be demihumans (elves/beastkins, zero interest).  absolutely no bloodied lolis (took me 4 years to get over the first episode of seeing index in a pool of blood and nearly killed until my friend's incessant recommendation made me continue the franchise, starting w railgun).

"psychological and horror manga with a genki/energetic male lead? ive read a lot of horror mangas and one thing i noticed is the 'genki pretty boy' archetype is rarely relevant to a mature plot. two examples are Minamoto Kou from Toilet Bound Hanako-Kun and the ex-boyfriend (yuki sato?) of Kokoa Yoshizaki from Killer In Love, but that's just about what i know. its a unique blend, let alone very refreshing as they're often constrained to shoujo/BL books. i just wish there were more horror mangas with a bubbly male lead. its a nice contrast of genre and character.  this is not pertaining to male characters who have bubbly & cheerful facade secret manipulators. im asking for horror mangas with genki guys/pretty boys who are hyperactive and energetic.",anime,1k8b0b6

"Similar vibes as ""From Old Country Bumpkin to Master Swordsman""? I know there are only 3 episodes out so far but I quite like the vibe of it and the animation style isn't bad either in my opinion. Does anyone have any decent recommendations? I haven't really watched anime in a few years so other nice recommendations from the last few years even if they don't fit any of the following would be cool too.   Some action, someone who is strong but doesn't just abuse it constantly but also isn't just getting wrecked, some decent animations and decent dialogues would be nice. The MC doesn't have to be ignorant or idiotic about their own power though. Would be nice if they are just a cool/chill guy though. Helpful, doesn't just want to sacrifice themselves but also aren't like manipulative or evil as shit.    I don't really like it when the entire story is just about ""the need to get stronger"" or ""the power of will/friendship/love/whatever"".

"recommendations for action shounen anime that are interesting and moving (long detailed post) planning to binge as many great stories as i can before i start college lol  first time posting on a forum for suggestions, so my bad for getting carried away. usually it's enough to just do the research myself but 1) i wanna be a bit more efficient this time since i can't slack once school starts 2) i just finished what has the potential to be my favorite anime ever and i'm desperate for a follow up. so incoming irritatingly detailed post    > what i'd like to see more like <  i'm a sucker for action shounen with a focus on intriguing worldviews and emotional connections. so i tend to be drawn to genres like adventure, fantasy, drama, sci-fi, and magic. but of course other factors also get me attached, so i can like other things too. forgive how much i carelessly throw around ""shounen"" but no idea how to better illustrate it than this:  • overall satisfies my shounen cravings in a well-rounded way (with bonus aspects): world trigger, hunter x hunter, jujutsu kaisen, attack on titan, demon slayer, naruto, haikyuu (you get what i mean)  • partly shounen satisfactory but gets a boost from other aspects: dr stone, blue lock, one punch man, bsd (stormbringer got me) [atla, weak hero, tower of god if we count non-anime]  • wholly/partly satisfies the mentioned cravings in a mostly non-shounen way: id invaded, mob psycho, assassination classroom, tokyo ghoul, the promised neverland (manga) [orv, s-classes i raised if we count non-anime]  • outliers kinda but still obvious why i like them: death note, charlotte, link click, code geass, saik k / tdlosk, spy family, wonder egg priority, terror in resonance, angel beats, no game no life (kinda)  • outliers but it's complicated to explain why i like them: black butler, mekakucity actors, durarara (yeah yeah i know)  i'm aware of some that seem like perfect fits (bleach, fullmetal alchemist, frieren, fate series, parasyte) but i've been a bit intimidated by them so kindly just convince me to finally get to them lol. chainsaw man also seems perfect but i tried and just can't seem to get into it. should probably try again at some point. i remember adoring kekkai sensen but it happened to be one of my first animes, so i don't remember anything at all now    > what i might not like to see <  i've checked out others not mentioned above, but i don't think they illustrate my taste enough to include. thought mha and noragami had a lot of potential, but disliked some of the later decisions (hand waves in the general direction of endeavor and yato's ""father""). thought fairy tail was nice but not enough to keep a place in my heart. and other such cases i don't remember at the moment   specific things i don't like are glaringly annoying tropes, such as the pervy character, siscon/brocon/lolicon/etc, female love interest that drops everything for / has nothing much besides a man, female lead supposed to be important but actually useless or lame, bland male mc having a harem, accidental/humorous sexual harassment, and more. i may power through to at least finish the damn thing like naruto and fairy tail, but usually i just straight up drop it like fire force and sao. i'm fine with cliches; in fact, even if they're plainly executed or overused, there are certain tropes i'm such a huge sucker for (cool tragic guys like hxh killua and world trigger yuuma). i just hate it when they get in the way of good writing or ruin the mood. so if you're gonna recommend anything remotely containing those annoying tropes, please warn me or else i'll just immediately give up on the anime at the first sight of them  my more unreasonable turn-off is any focus on romance. i'd like to say it's bcs of trauma from stories that failed in writing romance or even stories that could be argued were ruined by the romance, but honestly i'm just not that interested. hyouka was cute but eventually started to annoy me. spy family was fun, but anything the romance added was negligible to my overall enjoyment. i've also never been the kind to go crazy over types like your name and your lie in april. closest in that category that got me was a silent voice. closest romance overall that got me was probably kaguya-sama: love is war. so honestly just spoil me on anything romance-related (how much is present, how it affects plot, etc) to help convince me into any recommendations  i'm also unfortunately hesitant to watch anything really long, so yeah no one piece. anything a bit over 200 episodes but still on-going or finished but over 500 episodes is likely stuck to a watch later    > what to focus on for recommendations <  i think jujutsu kaisen, hunter x hunter, and world trigger are the best basis for my taste in typical action/adventure/battle shounen, while id invaded and haikyuu are the best extremes for outside that category. but you can take your shot at suggesting anything at all you believe is seriously high quality, underrated, or even just really interesting. just note that i'm easier to convince by appealing to the preference i explained rather than anything like popularity, culture, or ""just trust me bro"" so feel free to go crazy with gasing up your recs  just caught up to the world trigger anime and looks like it'll take years to get a new season and that's if it'll even get continued. with what i've seen so far, it might be the most solid show i've ever watched. throughout the whole thing, i kept thinking about how any complaints i've seen against other shows were easily unapplicable or in fact nowhere near even mentionable behind layers of diligent writing for world trigger despite being released years earlier. literally struggling not to just rant praises for it, but this post is long and inefficient enough so i'll end it here    tldr: recommend me really good animes with some explanation why, especially shounen with exciting action, impactful emotion, and interesting concepts. most especially anime similar to world trigger to help with the cravings it left me with. or recommend anything as long as you can present it enticingly enough",anime,1k3834o

"Help Finding an Old-ish Mech Anime Not sure if this is the right sub for this question (or the right flair sorry), but i've been trying to find and anime I watched back in highschool for many, many years and need some help.  I don't remember a whole lot about it, which is why I want to give it a rewatch. The things I do remember are below:  \- The main character was a high schooler. His 'mech' had something special/unique about it and it was mostly black. I seem to recall there being some purple there too but it could have been just some magic effects or something.   \- From what I can recall, the mechs throughout the show weren't big like Gundams. They were only a bit bigger than a human. I don't think any got bigger than that.   \- The MC could call or summon it.   \- Pretty sure I watched it on Crunchyroll around 2013.   \- It was only 1 season (not sure of any spinoffs or continuations, but it seemed like a hard end to the series).   \- I think the MC had a love interest throughout the show.   \- Final episode had MC saving the city/world and a mech fight with lots of flashing lights and effects (I know that's 90% of mech animes). It felt much more fantastical with lots of visual effects compared to the earlier episodes.   \- This one is a big asterix, but I think the name sounded German or something along those lines.  If this reminds you of anything, please comment the name so I can check it out when I get the time. I have scoured the internet for the last 5-ish years but can't find anything about it. Hell, I even starting thinking I made this shit up in my head, but I know for certain a school friend watched the 1st episode.",anime,1khcg9i
"Any gorgeous looking mid 80s to early 90s mech OVA, focused squarely on the mech stuff. I need something simple, just an OVA, preferably long-film-sized, that's all no-nonsense robot action; plot can be there, and it's even better if the plot is good, but the minimum is something that's very unpretentious about how we're there for the cool robots and spectacular animation.",anime,1kh9srj

"I have very faint memories of a strange anime, see if you can help me figure out what this is from. It was an anime set in modern time with some sort of magic combat system. The scene I remember took place in some sort of large villa. Someone was fighting outside while someone else entered from either the sewers or a secret underground passage. There was a fight involving combat marionettes, a fire started and the protagonists escaped via zipline. I think it's from between 2010 and 2018, but not sure.

"10 best shows? I may not agree with all, but well worth a look. My first post was rejected for not having enough characters, so here it is again with padded runtime. Hopefully beneficially so. :)  For their 10th anniversary Mother's Basement just released a video listing their take on the best anime of all time, and while I disagree with some of the choices the video does a great job at explaining why they chose these particular shows, and why you should watch them too. And they're most certainly well worth watching.  Some spoilers in the video for some of these.  >!10. Baccano!<  >!9. Full Metal Alchemist / Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood!<  >!8. Ping Pong the Anime!<  >!7. Jujutsu Kaisen!<  >!6. Neon Genesis Evangelion!<  >!5. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (and almost Cyberpunk Edgerunners)!<  >!4. Kaguya-Sama: Love is War (and almost Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju)!<  >!3. Cowboy Bebop!<  >!2. Re: Zero!<  >!1. Mob Psycho 100!<  And a bunch of honorable mentions seen only in video scenes and not actually mentioned. :)  [You can watch the video here](  The shows I'd like to add to the list are Violet Evergarden, Planetes and Eizouken, as I consider them of exceptional value to the overall world of anime, Violet Evergarden for its depiction of getting to grips with PTSD and a new world, Planetes for its themes of near-future in Earth's orbit, and Eizouken for its masterful usage of art as story-telling. But I know it's difficult to fit 30 shows to a 10 show list, so I'm not sure what to drop... I'm not a shonen battle show so probably the #7 entry, though I freely admit I haven't watched it. But judging on the others around it that I have, I feel confident in my assessment. And I'm not nearly as much of a fan of #2 as Jeff is, so there's a chance I'd replace that one as well.  Other shows I love and would greatly love to include are Aria the Animation, Yomigaeru Sora, School Rumble and Lovely Complex, but I'm well aware they're very personal choices and don't really fit the overal narrative of greatest ever. Well, except that Yomigaeru Sora is in fact the greatest realistic show I've ever seen or even heard of, and Aria is the greatest morsel of sugary bliss ever put to screen... ;)  That should be enough from me, the video says everything much better than my semi-illiterate ass ever could, so go watch it. And then watch the recommended shows. Or maybe even better go watch the shows first and then watch the video to validate your newly found favorites, and I'm \*positive\* if you watch all of these you \*will\* find some favorites among them. :)",anime,1kf7ea0

I remember 2 of them: a straight race, where one of the sides used some kind of motorcycle, and another one, where the MC team had to find a person hiding in one of the school rooms in a given number of moves.  4. There were either gems or something else of different colors, each of which gave a unique ability, one of them gave the ability to deceive. There weren't many of them, maybe around 10. And MC collected them. To get the gem, you had to defeat its owner in those duels-competitions. 5. There was no magic, but there was skills.",anime,1kd8dcz

"Looking for a show with dark aesthetics and a morally gray/evil protagonist I’m finishing up Overlord and want to continue watching a show with a morally gray, preferably male protagonist and dark aesthetics/themes.

"Anime about an mc that's manipulative I remember watching a certain scene where the MC is in the (i think) adventurer's guild (or tavern) and he was accompanied by some girl(s), the thing is some dudes (from another party) confront him about his method of doing things, I think it was one guy and one woman that questioned the MC, and the MC was harsh with his words pointing at ""truths"" about his way of doing things that almost starts a fight. I think it was an isekai (probably) and it's a series from these last... 3 years max (probably from 2024). I might be tripping but maybe the mc had white hair.

"Is there any reason to watch ""Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions!"" past season 1, episode 12: Eternal Engage? I recently binged the series on a platform that ended the series here, with episode 12, and I am at a loss for words. I frankly wasn't expecting much from this series, but I saw such good reviews here on Reddit I decided to give it a try. I haven't seen an anime with such profound subtextual layers, much less ones that resonated with me so greatly. I think I am a bit out of the target age range, which is why I was reluctant. That aside, I can't imagine anyone with emotions watching this series and not feeling something deeply, whether it's reflection, empathy, catharsis, or most vividly (for me at least), nostalgia.  That said, I feel like episode 12 was an absolutely perfect ending point, leaving so much to the imagination but making the future trajectory of the character development pretty clear, and that's if no more episodes, movies, or whatever, ever followed. I have seen very mixed reactions to this here on Reddit. Some say season 1 is the best place to end because the productions that follow make the show feel ""fizzled out."" Others agree with my standpoint, episode 12 being the ending makes the story's takeaways so much more intense (though I don't have a basis to agree with this or not). Finally, many also say that if you love the characters and the overall dynamic, the rest of the show is a must-watch. Though, for me, the characters don't necessarily resonate with me greatly (Maybe it’s because I went through my chunibyo phase close to half my life ago), the subtexts of the storyline hit home, in MANY ways, which makes this show one of my favorite stories of all time, out of any media. My fear is if I watch on, the show will shift in the direction I predict it will, thereby losing the intensity of meaning for me.  So, TLDR; where in the sequence of episodes/movies in the *Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions!* Saga is a proper stopping point and why? Specifically, if one wants to take away the strong subtextual lessons and feelings of nostalgia from the storyline, as opposed to being enthused by character development, is episode 12 of season 1 the proper ending?",anime,1kfhw5d

"Shows like Bang Dream It's MyGo: Broken imperfect people, drama. More details inside. Completely unexpected but Bang Dream It's MyGo resonated with me more that I thought it would. Something about how every character is imperfect, can be selfish, can have trauma, sometimes even manipulative and evil, and it just made them feel so real. Real kids just struggling to find their place in the world type of deal. Something about that really tugs on my heartstrings. I love the drama that ensues from it. Sure, it can be cliche or melodramatic, but it's the sincerity of which they do the things they do that I love. It's hard to describe. Tomori was an amazing character too.  Honestly, the comparison I have is Evangelion, just in the sense of the kids are all basically broken people and angst occurs. Eva is definitely on the more serious side, but it hits that same kind of ""broken person"" feeling.  A less good comparison but still one nonetheless, is Madoka Magica. Just the angst. Something about the angst. It's hard to describe.  Anyways, any shows like MyGo? Somehow they made it so that even with all the drama, it still felt lighthearted. And it's the characters that really make it shine.  Edit: Also, it's something about the ""social conflict"" that occurs when characters that are broken interact.

"Fantasy Harem Anime With More Than One Season I've watched a fuck ton of anime in my life but for some reason recently went 4 years watching no anime at all. Got back into it at the beginning of March and right now I'm in a serious harem mood.   Solo Leveling got me back into all this. That morphed into a desire to watch isekai. So, I binged Tensura, In The Land of Leadale, Killing Slimes for 300 Years S1, Tsukimichi, and a couple others, effectively leaving me with a strong desire to watch some MCs handle their ladies better than Makoto.   Over the past few weeks I've watched Hundred, Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter, Peter Grill, The Aristocrats Otherworldly Adventure: Serving Gods Who Go Too Far, & In Another World With My Smartphone. There actually are a couple others I've finished that I haven't mentioned and a few others that I'm watching on and off right now, but these are all the harem anime I've binged recently.   The aristocrat one had some funny moments and they got off to a good start with their rom-com shenanigans, but the animation and writing are so bad that the fun kind of ground to a halt around episode 9. I absolutely loved the Smartphone one on the other hand, but the way they ended season 2 gives me the impression that it ain't coming back.   In light of that, I would absolutely love recommendations for other shows similar to ""In Another World With My Smartphone"". Doesn't necessarily have to be an isekai. Just based in a fantasy setting. That said, if some people feel the need to shout-out their top 1 or 2 favorite harem anime that they think I just gotta watch based on the mood I'm in, I'm not opposed to hearing good recommendations.   Oh. Also. If it can't be found on Crunchyroll, please recommend where I can find it. For example, I know there's a really good one about farming. Can't exactly remember the name off the top of my head, but more importantly, I don't have a great place to watch it.  Edit: Since I made this post I have watched two new ones. First, I was extremely disappointed by season 1 of Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles. Because the main character has the emotional range of a 2x4 in 9 out of 10 scenes. The most emotion he shows in the entire season is the one time he gets really angry and even then he's fairly vacant. The story is generally melancholy, giving the feeling that there's a storm cloud constantly hanging over everything. Then, worst of all, there isn't really a harem here. Even though I have found this in more than one harem anime lists, rather than unintentionally surrounding himself with cute, loving waifus, Rio leaves women crying wherever he goes because he refuses to sit still and open up to anyone due to a stupid single-minded fixation on his mother. Where she came from and taking revenge for her death.  Then, I was slightly underwhelmed but overall satisfied with ""The 8th Son? Are You Kidding Me?"" Overall satisfied because it was generally decent, but underwhelmed because it wasn't really anything special and the harem got like 10% of this show's attention. Dude has at least three fiancees by the end of the season (maybe 4), but it's barely spoken of and there is just one kiss. These ""romantic"" arrangements are exceedingly political and dispassionate. I don't know if that gets better later on in the series, but there is no second season for me to watch and find out.",anime,1k6yztp

For example, the dive bar the capsules hang out at in Akira, or the shot of Jubei noticing Mushiro in the bamboo thicket from Ninja Scroll.  Can anybody advise on how I could acquire individual frames digitally in the best quality that could be turned into the artwork formats I mentioned above? I feel like if I were to just stream one of the movies and pause it I probably wouldn't get the best quality, right?",anime,1k40k8x
"wishing for a true happy ending romance... Hey wise-ones,  I'm looking for as the title says something not specifically romance themed or at not not just about pink-clouds and love and everything.. but... I seriously need some anime where the male protag finds true love and they live happily ever after.  I watched the following but did not really hit the spot.. and many were more tragical and sad than a happy ending.: Domestic Girlfriend (i cried) SAO (cried a lot.. christmas scene), Darling in the Franxxx (cried again), Eureka 7, Jobless Reincarnation (cried many times), Love Hina, Cuilty Crown, . and one with a Kitsune harvest godess meeting and getting together witha  merchant man .. cannot recall the name (cried again).  Watched others which are not really / clearly romance categories like : Monster Musume, Rosario no Vamprie, Accel, How to summon a demon lord, Freezing, Irregular at Magic Highschool, Fullmetal Panic... those were funny but did not hit the spot.  At this point I welcome any good that has some lenght, character development and it is has a turly happy ending... I'm at a point in my life when I really need some happe ending.  (erm... a m/f romance setup with a male protagonist where love is preferably displayed and acted upon)  Thanks in advance .. i guess..  EDIT:  some additional which I saw, but yould not remember: Toradora, Higehiro, ReLife,  .. must be many more and I'll remember them when I check them based on suggestions..",anime,1k3tbx2

"Any anime with an ML who acts similarly to Misa (Death note) or Hachi (Nana)? \- Lovesick, bubbly, himbo, clingy, acts a little spoiled, extroverted, the characters and/or his love interest might think he's annoying and he might not be OP but is pretty much an OP angel in the viewers' hearts, you probably have to relate to him to like him (or atleast thats the majority of what I've seen for Misa and Hachi)  Bonus if the person he likes is pretty much the opposite of him",anime,1k2buzj
"Need something like kaguya sama Kaguya sama is hands down the best romance anime ever made period. Absolute banger, I've also read the Manga and I also liked it. I liked the ending too contrary to the general opinion.  I need something that will full the void left in my heart by kaguya sama. If you say horimiya istg I will find you. It is extremely bland, unfunny, has bland af characters, no drama and an complete snoozefest compared to kaguya sama.  I'm watching teasing master takagi san and it's quite good.

"Looking for Suggestions~ I've recently returned to anime, around 6 months ago after a 2 decade hiatus, and I'm looking for suggestions my watched/dropped list is:  Jujutsu Kaisen, Mashle: Magic and Muscles, DanDaDan, Fire Force, Solo Levelling. Just into the second season's movie for Demon Slayer, and my favourite was My Love Story!!  Before I stopped Elfen Lied, Claymore, Shaman King were among my favourites.  I dropped Misfit Demon King (second season was BAD, it was enjoyable prior.), Eminence in Shadow (I understand the parody but it just wasn't for me, I don't think Isekai's are in general)  Frieren is high on the list for me to watch, but hard hitting emotional shows require a lot of energy for me to watch, I want to watch it but I almost fear how exhaust I'll be after. I was also considering My Dress Up Darling as I seem to click with romance anime pretty well.

"Looking for a longer series I’ve been chewing through some 1 season series, and am looking for something that has more for me to enjoy. I’ve been really getting into some shows and then get pissed they’re only 1 season long, because I want more.  Here’s some of my favorites: Kaiju No. 8; Overlord; Solo Leveling; Death Note; Darwin’s Game; Jujutsu Kaisen  Shows on hold: Reincarnated as a slime (a little too silly); Re:Zero (it’s good, but doesn’t suck me in); Demon Slayer (waaay too much silliness); Berserk (good but old); Code Geass (good but old)  Shows I don’t like: Attack on Titan (too much focus on “war bad”/trauma); 7 Deadly Sins; Sword Art Online (romance starts taking over/bad animation)  Stuff I don’t like: Romance; Very immature/silly; Slice of life; When the art style makes all the characters look like kids  Stuff I like: Action; Adventure; Intrigue; Politics; Dark aesthetics; Male protagonists; Morally gray; Thrillers; Plotline with twists and turns; Vampires; Cyberpunk  I’d prefer something more modern and well produced. I love intrigue and politics paired with action. I love sci-fi, fantasy, and urban fantasy. If I could describe the exact show I’m looking for it would be a multi-season action/thriller following a guy who starts a gang in the Warhammer 40k Necromunda universe.  Thanks.",anime,1kh3911

"Angels of death season 1 - last episode WTF Guys.  I’m in the middle of the last episode but I can’t. Please someone explain me. Zack went out from the exploding building, obviously hurt, with Rachel on his hands, shouting to her to wake up - and police is there , they see that and how they assume he is responsible for all of that? I mean that’s so irrational. They don’t fucking know what happened in the building, the only thing they know that there was a huge fire, explosions and whole building collapsed and there are two people going out that survived and wtf. And following this fact that was such an irrational situation that an obvious Zack’s reaction for me would be „noo, I didn’t do anything, there was a psycho/someone/whoever, I managed to escape with this girl, please help her” - that’s just an example but I hope you know what I mean.

"Cultivation anime recommendations I've hit that wall of what the hell do I watch now and could use the community's blessings.  The TLDR is I'm looking for a cultivation (xianxia I think?) type show that is English dubbed. My brain doesn't do well with other languages.  I'm pretty sure the dub preference has severely limited my options and yes I realize it causes me to miss out on other masterpieces.  Anywho, I listen to long audio series type shows and I've always loved the cultivation stories but video cdramas are rarely ever dubbed even though the visuals in the shows are so beautiful so I'm hoping anime has something for me.  I do have some advanced preferences that I like in my anime but I don't want to limit the responses cause I think the dub part is enough of a flag.  Typically I stick to adventure type stories for the story or plot I guess. I enjoy the journey and character development as they grow. Cultivation genre is pretty similar to that.  A little bit off the record my current number 1 show I've watched so far is ""86."" The feels I got from it are unrivaled from any other show, the soundtrack, animation, production were masterfully balanced imo. I don't expect a similar feeling from a cultivation show though cause by definition it shouldn't so don't worry about that.",anime,1kebx8n

"If you're looking for a 10/10 realized romance check out The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten. [The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten](   I'd advice you to stop reading here and just jump into it. It's hard to put into words how great this anime felt to me and it's one of those shows where any description run the risk of sounding dull. (At least that's my worry in writing this.) But I think this might be for you if you're stressed, if life is a bit much, if you need an escape from reality, and you *need* to watch something that's like a warm comfortable blanket that will whisper you away into ""good vibes"", hope, and and happy delight.   This is a predictable romance without any particular external conflicts to the couple. There are no rescuing the girl from kidnappers, fighting off a rival love interest, nor any danger.   Does that sound boring? It's definitely not! Not when they do it like this.   There's conflict, but it is with the characters themselves, internally. The protagonists are the antagonists as they fight insecurities and worries.   The basic premise is that a guy happens to live next door to the most popular girl at school. He believes himself to be ""not at her level"", and doesn't approach her with any carnal intent or hopes of romance. Rather, he sees her sitting out in the rain, and lets her have his umbrella. She later returns it, feeling guilty when it turned out the MC caught a cold from being out in the rain without an umbrella, and so the ball start rolling, slowly, downhill.

"A more adult version of UQ Holder? Manga request.  I’m a gay guy, but into more “typical” guy stuff like action, fantasy, sci-fi. Not into romance, drama, slice of life, etc.  BL/yaoi tends to primarily romance/drama. And if it is sci-fi/fantasy, it’s like one or two volumes. If I want basically “a shonen sci-fi/fantasy series with all the typical action stuff, but the MC gets laid regularly,” I’m basically only left with straight series.  I’m fine with that as long as there’s enough of the guy, but ideally I would like stuff that’s not 100% straight. Parallel Paradise is more or less perfect for me, besides the 100% straight part.  UQ Holder is nowhere near as explicit as Parallel Paradise, but it does have a decent amount of moments between Touta and Kuromaru while Kuroumaru identified as male. From kissing to being close while naked, Touta was more like…casually bi where he wasn’t hung up on being physical with Kuroumaru. Like Touta is basically straight but is fine doing stuff with Kuromaru.  I would like something that’s like a mixture of Parallel Paradise and UQ Holder. Has all the shonen action goodness with *some* dude-on-dude moments. Like a “typical” isekai harem, but MC has a guy in the group as well and gets with him like he does with the ladies.  The only one I’ve found like this is Adolescent Adam, where one of the harem members is a gay guy and the MC starts getting feelings for him as well. It wouldn’t need to be a “bi awakening” story and can be more like UQ Holder where Touta’s more “whatever” about Kuroumaru’s gender.  I would really like a series that’s…5+ volumes, but I don’t know if that’s asking too much. There’s no shortage of 100% straight ones that are that long (Parallel Paradise 20+, UQ Holder 28), so I think there should be *some* that are 5+ that are predominantly straight but have some bi/gay moments occasionally…(._.)

"Random Japanese words I want to learn more about anime series that taught us random Japanese words, like there is some quote in the series that is so memorable. For example:  “Omae wa mo shindeiru” (Fist of the North Star) “All according to Keikaku” (Death Note)  This is for a paper I’m writing, and I hope I have the right tag.

"Looking for silly romance manga where the love interests have “secret” identities By “secret” I don’t mean like Spy x Family where they’re secretly a spy or assassin, but rather that through some shenanigans one, or both of the love interests have secret personalities and the other one falls in love with their secret self, but still keeps talking to their normal self.  I’m not sure if I’m describing it well and I’ve had difficulties searching for manga like this since searching “romance manga with secret identities” gives me things I don’t want. I just love how silly and dumb the premise is and think it makes for very fun light drama.   Also the wackier the premise and the longer they keep up the secret the better. I’ve yet to read one where it lasts much longer than 30 chapters or so, which makes sense.  Here are examples of the ones i’ve read so far:  Ookami wa Tsuki ni Koi wo Suru (Wolf Falls in Love with Moon)  Super no Ura de Yani Suu Futari (Smoking Behind the Supermarket with You)  Omiai ni Sugoi Komyushou ga Kita (A Girl Who Really can't Communicate Showed up to My Marriage Meeting)  Gap Couple (A Man and a Woman Unaware of Each Other's True Identity)  Ore wa Shiranai Uchi ni Gakkouichi no Bishoujo o Kudoiteita Rashii: Baito-saki no Soudan Aite ni Ore no Omoibito no Hanashi o Suru to Kanojo wa Naze ka Tere Hajimeru (Falling for Her Secret Side)  Ones that aren’t it, but still scratch that secret itch: Horimiya  Bitter Virgin",anime,1k7b1ym
"An anime exactly in the vibe of Run with the Wind? Hi! The last \*new\* anime I watched was Run with the Win really years ago, when it got released. Ever since I dropped anime because I wasn't finding my cup of tea or maybe I've grown tired of them.   I'm here to give it a second chance years after this amazing anime. I'd like something EXACTLY in the vibe of this anime. Something realistic, just a cool story. Not necessarily about sports. Good animation. Teach good things like perseverance and friendship. Amazing soundtrack. Peaceful ambience globally speaking. Never this weird anime humor that I don't like. I don't really mind a bit of fantastic if it doesn't alter too much the realistic setting, for example Death Note.   I tried Haikyuu but I didn't like it. I know it's the same studio and music composer but the shonen vibe didn't sound quite right to me.",anime,1k6u0jn

All in all the story was boring for me)  Tower of god season 2 (Wtf happened lol, writing is terrible)  Fruits basket (I just physically could not watch this)   For even more context that you didn't ask for, I'm pushing 30 and more of a fan of adult themes and stories.

It just goes like a flat curve. I have heard that Naruto was inspired from HxH and I have completed Naruto and Shippuden and as of now HxH is a really dialed down, no stakes goofy version of Naruto. The major issue with Naruto was the fillers and the powerscaling and the finale. But it has phenomenal characters.  The phantom troupe, which I believe is the inspiration for the Akatsuki, is nowhere a serious group like the latter. Each of the members in akatsuki were written deeply, presented with a menacing power and had an ominous and epic background score. Compared to that, phantom troupe is a bunch of amateurs. I do know that in the end they are separate series and is not comparable. But the bottom line is, is it worth completing?",anime,1kfrkaz
"I NEED Anime Where the MC Is Hated, Then Destroys Everyone with Overwhelming Power Pls help no gay shit gotta be good don’t be like those who suggest girls nd panzers on war anime suggestions 😡  I’m looking for anime where the male human MC is constantly hated, discriminated against, or looked down on, especially in school or noble-class systems. The reasons can be anything—no magic, false accusations, low status, or being misunderstood—but the key is that the discrimination is persistent and systemic, not just one or two bad interactions. What I love is when the MC eventually proves he’s overwhelmingly superior and gets revenge by humiliating those who doubted him—whether through magic, power, or pure intellect. I’m not into sympathy arcs—I want that brutal, satisfying payoff where everyone who mocked him ends up shocked, regretful, or terrified.

"Name animes that you DON'T recommend watching. What I mean is, animes that has garbage endings, or animes gives you a lot of hype but all that hype goes to trash when you reach the end, or it finishes disappointing you... Or just animes that the whole series/movie are just not worth to watch.  I'm asking this because there is a saying that says _""Japaneses doesn't know how to make good endings""_. Now I'm seeing frecuent discussions about animes like Jujutsu Kaisen or the recent one like Boku no Hero _(I never saw both)_, in BHA because the shit ending it has as I know. In Jujutsu Kaisen I don't know exactly but I guess is something _close...?_  Other animes that I saw that I consider it that has bad endings, disappointing endings or... the series itself is just bad are for example: - **Erased:** the ending was very disillusioning - **The Promised Neverland (S2):** First season was EPIC. Second season felt very incomplete, like many parts were skipped, and the ending... Idk what the hell happened there. - **Tokyo Ghoul (S2, S3, S4):** First season was ok, some parts confusing but I kinda enjoyed it. Second season to fourth, I was getting a headache trying to understand what the fuck was happening. I know I have to read the manga to understand the series but I don't like reading mangas and wh-WHY  So with the given context, name animes that **YOU DON'T** suggest watching, to avoid having a bad time.

She mentioned to me last night that she wants to watch stuff together, and how she’s mentioned watching anime with me in the past, but that we can’t really come together and find something we both want to watch.    She typically watches a mix of sit coms, reality tv, cooking shows, some fantasy, murder mystery / cop dramas, etc but she can’t really handle violence/blood/gore. I love watching shonen, but the blood really gets to her, hence why we watch on different screens. She gets night terrors, and for whatever reason, some of the graphical elements of shonen really gets to her. I know it’s probably a normie take, but I’m personally not super into the idea of magical girls stuff or the high school dramas so I’ve never really given them a chance. I like things that are a little more mature/serious.  Can you guys help us find something that might fit both of our tastes? Ideally something that’s a little on the serious side but with some levity, omits the violence/blood. Much appreciated, thank you!  Edit 1: Forgot to mention, dubs would be preferable!

"Anime that isn't about minors Just really not about high school relationships, I was when I was a minor myself but being a 30F now I want comedy romance that is about adults !!   I especially hate anime where they just gloss over the fact the girl is only 14-16 and the guys she's with is about 23. (Shugo Chara was a fav magical girl manga till later I realized the main man was literally in HS and she was barley in 7th grade 🤮🤮🤮)  I did enjoy demon slayer and Tokyo Ghoul, was really into the Netflix animes like Castlevania and Sasuke. I really liked Eden of the East. Suggestions don't have to be romance comedy but I do like my ships.  Edit; Y'all is wild I'm over the moon. I've got a forever list now <3 Thank you",anime,1fx6e2v

I've been into anime forever (i started out on the romcom originals like princess tutu ,ouran highschool and fruits basket) but my girlfriend has never seen any, besides the occasional glimpse of naruto or Pokémon but she still can’t name anyone character but pikachu and naruto lol. She loves live action crime shows or even fighting action movies but she prefers the blood and guts over the supernatural stuff. I’m big into fantasy and supernatural but we connect on horror movies too. can i get some suggestions that a woman would like? also none too sexualized pls I personally love torodora, sword art online, fairy tale, hunterxhunter, Rosario + vampire , vampire knight, black clover, 7 deadly sins, Angel beatz, squid girl, and I just started watching Inuyasha from the beginning first watch and I love it.  Out of everything I like I feel like she would like sword art online the most from my perspective of her personality but I also think she would love 7 deadly sins if she really got into it. But I think she would be very put off by the oversexualization of the women.  I remember this really good horror anime trailer I saw once but I can’t remember the name. it was about an agency who hunts ghosts and other monsters. It was very cool like a crime/horror/drama.",anime,1dc4obs
"Anime that has realistically fast-paced combat instead of characters monologuing at each other every 20 seconds?

"What anime are actually better or at least as good dubbed? I'm almost exclusively a sub guy but my wife is the exact opposite.

If you have any others that are really good dubs I would appreciate suggestions. Maybe it will give me and my wife some more things to watch together.  Thanks.  Edit: I realize now that I'm such a nerd that I've seen almost all the ones people are suggesting but most of them I've only seen subbed so they are still great suggestions and I appreciate it.  Here's a running list of some of the more common suggestions  Death Note - never seen sub or dub (for shame)  Cowboy Bebop - started so many times never finished  Steins Gate - seen a few, gonna switch to dub  DBZ - obviously dubbed but never finished  Ouran highschool host club - switching to dub  Cyberpunk - I think I watched that dub but I'll check  Black Lagoon - in my watchlist. I'll start dub  Ghost in the shell - I saw it on AS and loved it  Baccano! - if it's set in America I guess I gotta go dub  Thanks for the lists so far!  Edit 2, electric boogaloo: I don't hate dubs and I don't watch subs for ""cool points"". I've had bad experiences with bad dubs likely caused by bad directors.

Anime that’s just batshit insane and unhinged I’m looking for an anime that makes you go “what the fuck is going on” and is completely unpredictable from one episode to the next. Like episode one and two could be a normal Isekai romance then episode three the girl goes crazy and kills everyone and episode six we are back on earth doing god knows what. It can’t be entirely a comedy like pop team epic but there’s nothing wrong with the show containing comedy. The anime also should make sense like one event reasonably leads to another.

"Anime where MC turns on everyone I'm looking for an anime where the main character betrays their friends, but more specifically what I really want is the devastated reactions of his friends, I guess the best term is emotion porn but I'm really looking for something like ""I'm Quitting Heroing"" at the very end where he tries to kill everybody or in the Eminence and Shadow when he betrays everyone as John Smith and Alphas reaction when she finds out, just utter devastation.

"Looking for the funniest, most hilarious anime ever I'm looking for an anime that will have me laughing throughout the show, where I'm just waiting to see what they'll say next in anticipation.   Preferably an anime that's not so action-based and flat-out bizarre like Jojo, I want one more because of what they say than what they do.   The dirtier the jokes the better, I don't care if they spam sex jokes the entire episode, I just want to laugh at the absurdity and humor of it",anime,1czume3

Anime must be released somewhere between 1992 and 2012  + I'm not a big fan of Fantasy and very unrealistic stuff; mecha, isekai, superheroes... y'know the deal  My fav animes that fall into this category include; Initial D, Serial Experiments Lain and Azumanga Daioh.",anime,1cn4lht

There's just way too much overexplanation or unnecessary dialogue or exposition. I'm currently studying dramatic writing and would like to be recommended anime with an air-tight plot, finished side-plots, great character arcs, amazing dialogues, good use of chekhov's guns that I can study and dismantle.

"Please give me suggestions for the most traumatizingly sad and messed up anime you have seen. For some reason I love messed up anime like Made in Abyss, Re:zero, 86 you name it but I especially loved made in abyss just because of the world building, adventure and wholesome aspects of it too that make the messed up, traumatizing scenes hit that much harder. Also please don't explain too much about the animes you suggest. I don't want to know how messed up it is going into it otherwise I'll be expecting it and it won't hit as hard.  Edit: Thank you all so much for commenting, I'm going to be giving every single one of these a try.  Edit 2: So far I've watched Grave of the Fireflies, School days, Anohana, A silent voice, your name, the first season of Clannad, deadman wonderland, devilman crybaby, death parade and erased. So far the best suggestions have gotta be the first three.",anime,1ecfmbj
"What is a good anime to watch while doing cardio at the gym? Criteria would be safe to watch in public, so that excludes stuff like Mushoku tensei and Baki.  Isn't too complex to follow, if it's largely dialogue and plot driven like Classroom of the Elite I don't get full enjoyment while working out.  Focus on effort causing great results and willpower in general. Something like One Punch Man would count for that. It could be a sports anime with competition rather than fighting such as blue lock.  Recommendations outside of that criteria are more than welcome if you have a reason.  Thanks for you subsequent suggestions!",anime,1cgyz5e

"Good beginner anime with no nudity or groping? Odd question I know, so let me explain. I'm not a prude, and enjoy anime tiddies as much as the next guy. Some of my favorite anime have been horny ecchi trash.  What I'm looking for is some good anime that I can introduce to people who are sensitive to that sort of thing.  Thing is, it's surprisingly common and seems to show up in anime that you wouldn't expect. Good example would be K-ON! Where Mio often gets groped by Sawako. Or the bathtub scene with Winry in FMA Brotherhood (although that one is pretty tame). Or the nudity in Code Geass.  My go-to is usually Death Note.  Edit: Wow I was not expecting so many responses!

Okay, I'm not a boomer but I'm very much shaped by 2000-2017 anime, in fact I only watch maybe 2 series in a year nowadays, I remember dropping Re:Zero season 1 at the last episode when it was airing like ""Yeah, I've seen this, I don't want to finish it."" and that's when I stopped watching anime regularly and instead started watching stuff I knew I for sure would like.

"Anime with a stupid premise that is surprisingly amazing. I'm looking for anime that have premises that sound incredibly stupid, but when you watch them they are surprizingly good. You would believe that the show is trash, but then it has a great plot with interesting characters, gorgeous animation and a banger soundtrack. Examples of shows I already watched:  - Keijo: Girls playing a sport where they have to push each other off platforms in swimming pools using only their butts and boobs. That sounds so stupid, horny and degenerate that it can only be average trash, right?! It turns out that this show is actually really good with funny and interesting characters, good animation and an interesting plot with good character development.  - Uma Musume: Horse girls running races. That is the entire show in a nutshell. When I read the premise I expected some mediocre braindead show that doesn't require any brains to watch. But then I was presented an amazing and inspiring story with sympathetic and interesting characters, funny stories and exciting races that had me on the edge of my seat. I found myself rooting for the girls and I wanted them so much to reach their goals!  - Mayonaka Punch: Maybe the biggest surprise in the last summer season. At first I wasn't really into the premise of a youtuber making a new channel with a gang of female vampires and I even considered dropping the show. But after a couple of episodes the characters really grew on me and I was eagerly awaiting the newest episode every week. It was a spectacle with cool and funny characters, great animation and also some really heart touching character development.

Like back in the day ranma ½ isn't hentai, but didn't shy away from showing nips.

"Anime with a 'real' harem. Usually when it comes to harem anime it usually is just an upgraded version of a love triangle where more than two characters are vying for the affection of the, usually male, lead.   Are there anime that depicts a functional polyamorous and/or polygamous relationship as a classical understanding of a harem would lead towards?   I believe this most often is depicted in hentai and adjacent properties but I'm not interested in the sexual nature of the relationship but instead the interpersonal relationship being in a harem would actually tackle.

"""Take me away"" - please suggest me your best anime that will take me into another reality Anything that gets you fully immersed in another time, or on an adventure, or in another world with convincing and immersive world building.  For the record I am aware this encompasses most animes.. I just don't know any. I've never given any a fair chance, having only ever really watched Deathnote and Full Metal Alchemist a decade ago when I was a teenager. However, it's not intentional avoidance, just not something that ever crops up in my brain (""today I shall watch an anime"") but I spend most of my life obsessing over things like Harry Potter, Over the Garden Wall, Hazbin Hotel, LOTR, Star Wars etc, so it's occurred to me it's daft of me not to be watching anime as well, as some of those seem to be unrestrained and even more imaginative than the franchises Ive listed  So, I want something that will immerse me into a complete ""world"" and go on an adventure; other than that I have no limitations on the criteria.  If anyone wanted to know the sort of ""aesthetics"" that have interested me in the past though; I'm more inclined to high-fantasy than I am sci-fi, but I'm not someone who's obsessed with mythical swords or anything like that, I just enjoy a ""folktale"" type environment. Similarly I'm also a big fan of nature (I'm sure we all are lol but you know what I mean) and I love Ancient History/Ancient Religions, so if this took place in a forest, or with like shamans/druids or anything like that then that would be appreciated - but isn't necessary. I just want to be ""lost in a different world"" because work sucks right now and I'd like something to take my mind off it.  Thank you all :)  EDIT: Oh snap I fell asleep, woke up and loads of you have commented! Thank you all so much, I will add all of these to a big list and get through them all.

"Good more realistic and 'mature' anime I was never really all that much into anime as a teen besides like Dragon Ball and Yu-Yu Hakusho when I was younger. But I've realized I quite enjoyed the more grounded type of anime. I hate to say I like more the 'mature' stuff because I think it's a tad condescending but I certainly prefer that type of story. Some of the stuff I've liked recently have been: Kaiji Ultimate Survivor, Cowboy Bebob, Fullmetal Alchemist (2003, Brotherhood kinda went too all in on the comic relief), Berserk (1996-7?), Black Lagoon, Spice and Wolf, Freiren, Gundam 08th MS Team, and War in the Pocket.   So basically anything that's less ""beat-up the villain with the power of friendship, plus pointless fanservice"" and more ""grounded realistic drama"" I also like fantasy stuff too, just the more grounded fantasy that isn't just a power trip. I thought Freiren and Spice and Wolf did that really well.  Any recommendations would be great, bonus points if it's in that older hand-drawn animation style, I really do love the look of the older Gundam stuff, cowboy bebob, Trigun ect. I really don't care for how most modern anime looks, looks very plastic-like most of the time",anime,1cga3gc

"Anime that makes you cry while being epic and not overly sexualized? I'm having a hard time finding some good anime lately that have:  * some epic storyline * heartbreaking moments/stories * not isekai * not sexualized (I'm bored with cleavages and all of that :/ ) * preferably fantasy/sword/medieval, but open for everything :)  For example, the ones I enjoyed:  * i really enjoyed the second movie of **Boku no hero Academia: Hero Rising**. Even tough the whole storyline was a bit boring, the ending where Izuku Midoriya and Katsuko go all out, with such a beautiful soundtrack in the background that it left chills for days. I still occasionally watch that specific part once in a while just to get the feeling when I saw it for the first time. [This reaction from a theater describes it nicely]( * Demon Slayer, soo many heartbreaking moments, beautiful art and songs * Attack on titan, a classic with a little letdown of an ending, but all in all a great anime!

Other animes I've really enjoyed are: -No Game No Life -Death Note -Code Geass -Ergo Proxy -Legend of Galactic Heroes -Ghost in the Shell -Psychopass -Log Horizon -The Promised Neverland -Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt -Steins Gate  Animes I've tried but didn't like: -Attack on Titan -Overlord -High-school DxD -World's End Harem -Kino's Journey -Texhnolyze  Thanks in advance.",anime,1d2j1h5

Death Note, it's my animegate, I loved the struggle of Light vs L but kinda lost interest once that was over tbh, I finished it and think it's great tho. 8.5/10    2. Monster, I love the detective vibe on this one and the moral dilema of the doctor, it's been a while since I watched it but I remember thinking the ending felt like it lacked something but the ride was good. 9/10    3. Steins Gate, what I liked about this one was the charaters, the slow buildup and specially  the second half when shit gets real 9/10    4. Code Geass, I remember thinking this was like an actual smart Light and loved seeing how he got himself out of trouble but found myself bored with the filler episodes (like the highschoolers running around) and thought the fanservice was way too much, the ending was amazing tho 8.5/10    5. Attack on Titan. I liked the characters and the setting, at the time I was watching game of thrones, so violence and characters dying were enough to entertain me, but once the second season ended I realized I was not enjoying how little it was advancing so I quit watching 7.5/10     So, based on these and my thoughts, which anime would you recommend I watch next?",anime,1espo53

"Hell’s paradise is a 10/10 Watching this rn and it’s real good. One of those 13 episode anime’s that u can watch in a day. It’s a gorey one with a lot of brutal action. The visuals are nice too!   If u care to watch it, it’s about a group of criminals who are on death row but the only way to make it out alive is getting sent to an island for an Elixir of Life with all types of risks and huge ‘attack on titan’ like beasts. Basically kill or be killed. Each criminal is aquatinted by an executor that is ordered to behead them when they’re out of line. The executors are also fighting for their lives and can only leave once they’re criminal is dead and their head is brought back. The criminals make alliances and stuff to help survive and help search for the elixir but at the end of the day, only the criminal who finds the elixir will be the one to make it out of death row. The show has a lot of great scenes and good action in every episode it’s definitely worth the watch. The main character is Gabimaru but it definitely gives lore and shows all the rest of the criminals sides and how they’re putting up with the risks. I don’t wanna give too much detail but I have to make the 1500 character mark so I’m just gonna type random things now  I like how they portray Gabimaru’s character cause he’s laid back and doesn’t want to kill but at this point they all have to. He’s also extremely diligent and brutal in fights. The opening theme credits also have really good visuals that I enjoy. At points in the show it gives a short backstory lore to most characters in their childhood and it’s mainly bloody scenes",anime,1f7hyhl

"Anime where female character adorably sucks at being a baddie I seem to like animes that have the trope of a main female character assuming an antagonistic role or title where they are obligated/compelled to play the baddie, but fail at it in a comical and adorable way where they are all bark and no bite and other characters either don't take them seriously or are continuously fooled only by them narrowly keeping up appearances.

"Why hasn't demon lord 2099 been popular this season? It's secretly the best original thing to come out this year I started watching this show on a whim and wasn't really expecting much from it. Based on the description it seems like slop anime but honestly this show shocked me.  This show feels like a more refined version of the devil is a part timer. It subverts the reincarnation trope, and the setting changes so much over the time from when the protagonist dies and reincarnates that he's not really powerful anymore. Humans invented a way to surgically implant a chip in their brains that allows people to learn magic without having the talent for it. Anyone with those chips are usually stronger than the protagonist. It asks the question of, is experience better than technology.   If I gave a real world example, kind of the same argument for if fighter pilots are still needed when dogfighting isn't a thing anymore. Just lock onto your target from miles away and that's it.   The characters are extremely well done and have really good development. The plot itself is well thought out and doesn't trip over itself (not many plot holes, if any. Very good at answering your questions and alluding to answers).   The soundtrack is honestly some of the best this entire year. I can't compliment that more.   The drawbacks I have with those show are really with its animation. It's not bad, it's pretty solid especially when there are fight scenes. It just can feel a little sloppy in a few spots but almost unnoticeable. Other than the animation, the art itself is stellar.   I wanted to try to bring some attention to this show because no one seems to be talking about it and it's such a shame. It's one of the few shows we're I honestly think it's underrated.",anime,1hpsc0y

I feel like my main issue is the writing. There's just so much excessive fanservice, lolis, incest, blatant nationalism, redundant dialogue/exposition, the constant exclamation of the characters (not a writing issue, just something I find super annoying), working on a principle of telling instead of showing, etc. And I think I'd personally enjoy some anime that are known for having great writing. I'd consider good writing to be concise, show don't tell, compelling characters, and deep symbolism and themes (these aren't necessarily required considering there are plenty of stories with amazing writing that don't really have much of a theme or message, but it's nice to have one if there is).

Also Apothecary Diaries, you can just tell the author knows their stuff.  Basically something realistic that doesn’t go with the common  slice of life anime trope.

"Need help identifying an anime about a boy who meets a girl with paper manipulation powers who can only go outside during the day when it is raining Edit: The anime is called 'Sola.' You can watch it online for free on the TUBI streaming app.   I once saw an anime in the 2000's to 2010's that was very intriguing and I want to watch it again but I cannot remember the name. It came out around the time the 60GB iPod Classic was still popular so 2001-2014. It was a mystery/drama with some romance and had a very melancholy and mysterious vibe to it. I believe the name of the anime was in Japanese only and was fan subtitled into english, so I have simply forgotten the name. Googling 'girl with paper powers' gives me results for Naruto and Read or Die, but these are not the anime. I think the anime was in 4:3 aspect ratio, but I could be mistaken. It was a one-off OVA miniseries with no filler episodes.   Plot summary: The main character is a boy who meets a girl similar to his age on a rainy or overcast day, maybe at night. The girl is always carrying an umbrella so she can protect herself from the sun. The boy learns the girl can only go outside either at night, or during the day when the weather is rainy or overcast because the sun seems dangerous to her. The girl likes rainy days because she can go outside. The anime has very muted colors because it takes place primarily in dreary weather or at night. The girl also has mysterious powers to control origami paper with her mind. She can use the magical paper to form life-like objects that are indistinguishable from the real thing. The two begin to form a relationship. Near the end of the story, spoiler for those who might want to watch: >! the boy discovers that he was created by the girl using her origami powers so she wouldn't be lonely. He's made of origami paper and starts to unravel. I can't remember what happens next and how it ends. !<  Edit: I think I remembered another detail. I believe the girl's umbrella had a picture of the blue sky with white clouds painted on the inside of the umbrella because the girl had never been able to see the blue sky with her own eyes.  Any help is appreciated. Thanks.",anime,1cdirst

"What anime have fanservice with strong plots? I ask this specific question as I was looking at the show To Love Ru, and don’t get me wrong in that the show is kind of fun for its wild and shameless nature regarding the fanservice, but I sometimes wish that it had a bit more depth with its plot.     See, my point is that I have been wondering if an anime series could be racy, but could also carry a compelling plot to go with it to show that there is more to the show deep down as again I do have a soft spot for shows like To Love Ru, but at the same time, I wish the show had more to offer besides fanservice as I have noticed that’s all people ever focus on when it comes to discussing the series.     One last thing I would like to mention is that I can take mecha shows, or romantic comedies that have fanservice elements, as long the plots have some depth in their writing because like I said, I am ok with fanservice in modern anime as that kind of imagery doesn’t bother me, but again I just want something with strong writing in it if such shows do exist.",anime,1cy6vxl

"Recommend anime to watch with my 60 year old mother I am 32 myself but live fairly close to my mother so I visit her weekly and recently we have started to watch episode or few of anime when I am there. I would need some recommendations here are the shows so far we have watched and if she liked them.  * The Apothecary Diaries - This one is her favorite. * Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill - She really enjoyed this too and made me several of the foods in the show. She regularly watches normal cooking shows on TV. * The Misfit of Demon King Academy - Likes this one and finds it hilarious even if it is bit hard for her to keep up on what is going. * That time I got reincarnated as a slime - Likes but is bit hard for her to follow with all the gaming terms etc. * Demon Slayer - liked, the animation is pretty. Easier for her to follow than Tensura * JJK - Did not like, too depressing. * Brave Bang Bravern! - I admit this was more of a joke from my part, I liked it but for my 60 year old mother the homoerotic innuedos of the robot were too much also the show is so random.  My mother has also probably seen Naruto at some point at least some episodes because she did help me make my cosplays in 2006 and 2008. She even was the one that did my make up when I cosplayed Orochimaru and my Shippuuden era Neji cosplays clothes were completely made by her from scratch.  Her first language is not English and we do watch with English subs as there are none available in Finnish. So series that use a lot of modern slang are not that easy to follow for her.  I personally have watched hundreds of different anime, but most of them are stuff I know my mom will not enjoy. I like the most basic shounen and the trashiest isekai.     EDIT: Thank you for all the suggestions. I am making a small booklet with anime suggested here with short summaries about the series that she can choose what she would like to watch as a mothers day gift to her.

"Need anime suggestions for my wife Must not have a lot of fan service (panty shots every 5 min for example - so definitely not the highschool prison anime with the horny nerds lol). The majority of females shouldn't have pointlessly large breasts (must be realistic). Preferably nothing to do with high school students, but not a deal breaker. Prefers an adult cast. Must not have slapstick comedy (hates characters like banana girl in Aho Girl) While it contain some romance, the majority of the story must not be centered around romance. Preferably no drama or at least, very little. Nothing trying to be too philosophical. No mechs. No sexual innuendos with very young characters (no loli). No incest. Nothing too slow paced.  Examples of anime that we've enjoyed: Dungeon Meshi and Attack on Titan. Planning on showing her Dorohedoro next.

"What Anime has the best genre shift? Basically I am referring to shows that are not afraid to experiment by changing genres as picture a show that starts off as a slice of life based show about people going on fishing trips, but then the sane show starts to evolve into something more meaningful where one incident happens that causes the main characters to go on a life changing adventure where they must save their planet from a madman.      I don’t know if such a show exists, but it could be interesting to see one for again changing genres as it could make for a very interesting show if done right as suddenly the two main characters are finding meaning in their lives by having to help their planet as suddenly things are getting hectic.",anime,1ehkv6d
"Anime where death really matters Obviously just being recommended here will be a spoiler for some shows which I'm okay with but if anyone else is just browsing keep that in mind.  I'm not looking for shows with a lot of deaths or that anyone can die, and I'm not looking for shows specifically about ""getting over"" grief, though either of those elements are okay.  I want to see some shows where important characters die but they aren't just forgotten about. They continue to be remembered by the rest of the cast and their deaths ""cast a shadow"" over the remainder of the story so to speak.  The two I've seen that come to mind are Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Gurren Lagann.  Edit:   Thanks everyone, I'll try to sum up some of the most common and popular suggestions here.

Or ones like naruto where it became more about naruto being obsessed with Sasuke and chasing after him. And mha where he calls katchan (not sure how to spell his name) his friend regardless of how badly he behaves towards people. I did like mha though. Also liked death note, parasyte the maxim, pre super dbz, beastars, black clover. Some stuff where the main character goes through the ringer and had emotional and mental growth type stuff.

"Looking for anime ""Evan the gay Alien"" Hi! So I am looking for an anime I was recommended by someone I met at an event last weekend. I don't have their contact details to ask and I cannot find it as much as I look for it.   I know this might sound weird but the name I was given for it was ""Evan the gay alien"" but it doesn't seem to exist. I don't know how Evan is gay or an alien because it was never explained and didn't come up again in the conversation.  Also, I am LGBTQ+ so please please don't think I am making fun of anyone.   They showed me pictures on their phone of big robots and anime characters. They said it was a classic.  It sounded like something I'd be into and love to give a go.   The only other clues I can remember was that there were some controversies around it?   It isn't American Dad or any American cartoon, definitely an anime.   I asked my anime friend who suggested Saber Rider, Gundamn or Brave Bang Bravern, which I don't think it is (Might watch those too though).

"Need An Anime Recommendation Thats Cool, Mature and Accessible So I have watched a bit of anime in my time but not enough and I am trying to find something my friend and I can watch. The thing is he hates any cutesy stuff in anime. Specifically when a female character is overly saccharine or behaves like caricature for a male audience. Generally he likes sci-fi and action (i.e. cool), especially when it takes itself seriously enough to give a viewpoint on the world (Mature) typically aimed a little higher brow than say deathnote without relying on fanservice and that anime factor which gives the style its reputation.   What we have watched and loved:  Ghost in the shell  Akira  Neon Genesis Evangelion  I recently showed him Elfen Leid, the intro sequence was exactly right, the office staff and ditzy female character got an eye roll but the music and atmophere was spot on and the sequence set up the whole show for success and then a character becomes a forgetful cat-girl for the remainder.

After introducing officers and club goal we watched FMBA and Zom 100 (both of which I've seen) and I want to plan for my next meeting.  Only no thanks to anime is if there's nudity or sex prominently in the show or in the first episode. Later on in the series is fine because we just go watch an episode of each show before finding a new one in most cases. Any recommendations would be great! :D    Edit: Thank you all for your suggestions! I'll take some time to look through them all. Thank you all so much! I didn't think this would get so much attention :D,anime,1fa10ft
"Looking for anime to cheer me up I have been a little sad these past few days, but it’s nothing a good show can’t fix. I am looking for anime recommendations, either romance, comedy, or slice of life, which doesn’t require a lot of brain while watching. Some of my all time favourites include The Disastrous Life of Saiki K, Welcome to Demon School!

"What this anime be with a gorey skeleton turned dude? (to be honest not sure but the artstyle was very animelike from my memories)  So when I was younger this anime scared me now I want to find it  What I remember is that there were two guys fighting and suddenly the good guy(im assuming lol)  was throwing up I think and its now hazy, but he just had his whole bidy rearranged with bones sticking out and he stayed like that. Thats all, I have my suspicions that its from maybe Dragon Ball since the tv channel it was on it probably only had older animes and in my country there are very few animes that are dubbed (hungary) and obviously it had hungarian dub so maybe at this point Im just looking for the episode, but I'm not even sure I could recognise it",anime,1cshuue

"Any Examples of ""Modern"" Anime Series With Absurdly High Production Values? A common critique of 21st century anime series is that they cut a lot of corners to save money in comparison to projects from the 80s or 90s.  I'm trying to make a list of shows that eschew this standard, where the animation, art style, and music all come together to make a ""just ok"" show punch well above its weight.  Not even necessarily looking for great writing or something ""flawless"", just series that go above and beyond when they could have easily phoned it in.  Some of my best examples:  Angel Beats! (2010)  Made In Abyss (2016)  Steins;Gate (2011)  anything Studio Trigger has worked on  first season of One Punch Man (2015)",anime,1eq23ws
anime with a suicidal mc? Life hasn't been fun and I'm struggling right now. I wanna watch something where I can relate to the mc. Something where they have thoughts of cutting their life short or where life is rough and it's eating away at them.,anime,1ed5vd2
Comedy anime that has a story? Every comedy anime I have been recommended was either school drama or one of those animes that act more like nickelodeon show aka.

"Anime where a character learns how to be human? Something like Fushi from To Your Eternity or Hyakkimaru from Dororo.

"Suggest me an anime with massive thighs in it I misread a recent post here and was thoroughly disappointed when I went to the comments. As such, I am here to ask you all directly.  It can be men/women like Machio for How Heavy Are the Dumbells You Lift? or Ghislaine from Mushoku Tensei.  It can be huge monster girls such as Tio from Monster Musume.   The most important part is just that it has to have an impact on the ""plot"" and preferably not just one time, like if you suggest me a show that is 50+ episodes long, it shouldn't just be portrayed in one scene or episode.",anime,1dw7xbk

"Request for anime with female lead I'm a bit tired of utterly useless female characters. I've slowly began to hate this trope the more I see it. Hated it in Naruto, One Piece, JJK, etc.   Need an anime with:  \- Female lead character. Not one of the main characters or important characters. I'm looking for one where the lead protagonist is a girl. Other than that, it doesn't matter to me whether other characters are male or female.  \- shouldn't be a weakling who keeps getting saved(basically no useless mc)  \- Shouldn't be a loli  \- Fanservice is completely fine by me. In fact I'd like it more. If it's not really there then that's also fine.  \- Don't prefer yuri. But if that anime is really good then I don't mind.  \- Don't want an all female cast. Would like to see a cast that's a little more balanced than that.  Genre is not an issue but it'd be nice if it was more of action and fantasy. If it's shonen that would be awesome.  Thanks in advance.  Edit: holy shit that's a lot of comments. Thanks for the recs everyone. This will be enough for a few weeks at least.",anime,1h22svu
Anime where there's a character with closed looking eyes normally but when something (badass or shocking or cool) happens they open it I know this is a little werid request for suggestions but Im kinda in mood of this type of character 😅 Best example i can think of is Gin Ichimaru from bleach.

Like that character from Tower of God I just finished S1 of Tower of God and holy, the hate I felt towards Rachel is so high, I don't think I've hated anyone, fiction or otherwise like her.   I prefer when the show only gives you a reason to hate that particular character at the end of the season like Tower of God.

"Help Me Become An Anime Guy Alright, so I have alot time specifically to watch tv/movies/internet stuff. I would like to enjoy anime but I get turned off and cringed out so easily by it.  I recently watched the cyberpunk anime because I love the game. I liked the violence, nudity, sad ending and overall adult themes. In my ignorant opinion most anime I have seen has been cringy and strange. Years ago I watched some of ""parasite"" and I thought that was pretty cool. Grew up on dragon ball, pokemon  and Naruto but I'm looking for more adult centered shows/movies. I've heard Berserk is good but haven't seen it. So, here's a chance to convert someone! Gimme suggestions for adult themed, violent and nothing centered around a school Ideally.   Update~ Big thanks to everyone recommending things!!! I just started Vinland Saga and I'm liking the vibes about 10 minutes in. Please keep sending your recommendations though and I'll update again when I finish Vinland Saga.  Update~ I just finished Vinland Saga. I couldn't have enjoyed it more absolutely exactly the type of thing I was looking for. Thanks to all those who recommended it!!! I won't spoil anything, but I will say I'm torn on which season I liked more. Both were excellent but very different. I'll be reading through the comments again and deciding on what's next.   Update~ I've watched 6 episodes of Devilman Crybaby. I hate it, alot.... I've really tried but I won't be able to finish it. I didn't like the animation style, writing, speed of plot development(too fast) and the over the top adult themes just come off as silly and lack any weight.

I want the story to involve sex, but I don't want everyone to be in a bikini all the time for no reason.  The closest thing I can think of is the Bakemonogatari series -- I loved that. It degenerated after the original Bakemonogatari, but still -- it had sex as a theme and a frequent occurrence, without any gratuitous beach scenes and whatnot.  Any thoughts, experts?  Edit: thanks, everyone, for some really great suggestions! To those suggesting hentai, I really think you've missed the point.",anime,1dyln27

People going on about their daily routine and yet a story kept unfolding. Idk how to explain it to you guys properly but for once I wanna watch an anime with no supernatural component in it.   Even rom coms would do but again not the kind in which people fall in love just like that. I mean the plot shouldn't be too flimsy.

I know there are tons of shows that just depict pain in a more a true-to-life way, but I'm a little tired of things ending at just the existence or acceptance of pain. Something like Your Lie in April spends a little too much time devoted to uncovering the trauma rather than healing from it, for what I'm looking for.

What’s some series similar to Beserks energy? The last movie was my favorite with the demonic scenes. My primary focus in my search is twofold: the messed up moral situations and the realism of the impact of these messed up situations (full metal alchemist and beserk both really scratched this itch for me). Even conspiracy theory/fantasy is welcome. 2nd: aggressive sexual energy or even a Stockholm syndrome romance. Even if the sexual energy is just a little and the fucked up morality is frequent I’d be happy with that. I just like the crazy rollercoaster of anime.

I don’t watch as much anime as I used to back in the day due to boring adult responsibilities but I’m slowly starting to get back into it. Honestly I have to credit Attack on Titan for reincarnating my love for this medium - it’s one of the best anime I’ve ever watched and just one of my favourite stories in general from any medium.   I have watched a lot of the classics in the medium - FMA/FMA Brotherhood, cowboy bebop, death note, samurai champloo, reign, bleach, Naruto, demon slayer etc. as well as some great ones not in that top tier of popularity such as Last exile, wolfs rain, scrapped princess, Elfen lied and what have you.  I’ve been perusing the top lists on MAL and discussions on this sub to create a list of anime I want to watch going forward, and wanted to get yalls opinions on if this is a good representative list of the good shit that has come out in the last few years (and even before) and if there’s anything great I’m missing.

Or potentially just a single human or group of people fighting against heaven and hell, doesn’t specifically need to be the whole of humanity just more or less the concept, and it would be nice if it’s a desperate struggle kinda story, like how rezero is for its protagonist, just cause it would be weird if a human could easily destroy angles and demons. But if none of you know any good humanity vs heaven and hell then I’d take humanity vs heaven, cause there are already loads of great humans vs demons/hell such as demon slayer and blue exorcist.

I know you can get a somewhat decent glimpse into Japanese lifestyle through a lot of animes, but I didn’t know if there was one that had a setting that really revolved around the day-to-day type of life of normal people around the country.

"Anime that don't start as romance but build a romance through the show? IDK if the title makes sense but I'll explain. Looking for anime that that's isn't necessarily romcom.

Some examples may be Gurren Lagan and maybe Eureka Seven.",anime,1hetlf6
"Why are modern anime titles so long and silly? This might seem like a dumb or obvious question for some. I’m just genuinely curious. I’m not a consistent consumer of anime. I maybe watch one series a year, sometimes I’ll find a few during the year I vibe with. I noticed a few years ago (it likely started before I noticed) that there’s been a trend of long and bizarre anime titles that sound so blatant and on the nose and I hear that often the show has literally little to nothing to do with the title. Stuff like I Was Reincarnated as a Slime (this one ain’t so bad), Is It Wrong To Try To Pick Up Girls in A Dungeon?,  Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It, I've Somehow Gotten Stronger When I Improved My Farm-Related Skills, etc….Like what the fuck?

"What are some good isekai anime that don’t have harems? The harems aren’t explicit I guess you could say, but when every girl interested in the protagonist has cleavage that defies physics, I find it really annoying. If it’s done well/comically, like in “The Eminence in Shadow”, then it’s ok, but if the guy’s groping in the first five minutes *cough cough* Overlord *cough cough* I’m checking out of it.  I also found it distasteful when, in “Mushoku Tensei”, the guy was reincarnated in a little kid’s body but had lude comments/thoughts towards women far older than him.  I like:  That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime  Eminence in Shadow  Ascendance of a Bookworm  The Rising of Shield Hero  A Returner’s Magic Should be Special",anime,1f7n1m6

"I need an anime that; Hii! I recently started watching anime again but as I grew older, some series just don't hit the same. I am looking for an interesting plot with good characters and as less fanservice as possible. Recently I finished Re:Zero and I really enjoyed it. I found somewhere that I could watch Konosuba afrer re:zero but it was so, soo terrible. (Edit: I understand that you might be frustrated with my opinion but I am more into mature stuff, also humor of this anime is just not for me. Maybe I'll give it a try someday, but not anytime soon :( thanks for encouraning me though) I skipped after first 10 minutes. Then someone recommended me Classroom of Elite and it was mid but ""watchable"" until the pool episode (6) when camera keept zooming at boobies too much like cmon. That was an ick to me so I skipped. I am really picky now that I am older. Oh and I also don't like male/female leads that are tsundere type lol This might be helpful but I also enjoyed watching Demon Slayer, Kusuriya no Hitorigoto, Terror in Resonance, Monster, 91 Days, Dororo, Dr. Stone, Jujutsu Kaisen, Heavens Official Blessing, Noragami, Saiki Kusuo, Link Click, Aot, Spy x Family, Tomodachi Game, Friren.",anime,1dez9ys

"Anime where MC is unforgiving. Somebody essentially made a post like this but you know how animes often promote this sense of ""killing is bad"" and ""revenge makes you no better"" and ""killing the killer just makes you a killer too"".   I cringe at that pathetic logic and it often ruins an anime for me. Especially when an antagonist did some purely despicable shit and in the end the MC doesnt even kill em. Like the other guy said, offers redemption instead or simply jails em with mercy.   I need an anime that is absolutely gruesome, to the bone, as blunt as can be. ""Oh you want mercy? Nah, bring the dead back to life and we can talk, you can't? Nareba, shine da"" typa shit LOOL.   Death Note was interesting because Light held the view that true justice means delivering death. L believed it wasnt so and killers are to face trial and be judged by the system and the system is what decides life and death. In the end, L's foolishness got him killed, Lights foolishness got him killed. Two sides of an extreme left and extreme right.

"‘Nana’ is a masterpiece I love alot of shows but very few i recommend because alot of people dislike my taste, however ‘Nana’ is beautiful. Each character is human, as they all make mistakes, have different personality traits and just make realistic choices compared to another slice of life anime that maybe feels a lot happier and joyful but realistically has a slim chance of your life being that way.  ‘Nana’ is about two girls with the same name who coincidentally meet on the same train going to the same place and end up trying to rent out the same building just when they might have never seen eachother ever again. For me, ‘Nana’ had described an old situation and friend group of mine and the two main characters (Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu) remind me of myself and an ex friend of mine. This was the first time i had thought about her since we last talked because for me, I had already moved on from our friendship before it officially ended. Because Nana Komatsu is who seems to the real main protagonist, i get to see how my ex friend felt and what she might have been thinking.  What i meant by that is, Each character is so human-like, alot of people can see similarities in themselves or in people they know, it just so happens that I act like Nana Osaki while ex friend acted like Nana Komatsu. It may teach you about other people, about yourself or about other things in life. Even if you aren’t into realistic shows, it is worth a watch ‘til the very end.   TL;DR  ‘Nana’ by Ai Yazawa is a show i really recommend due to its surprisingly realistic characters, and it may teach you about peoples emotions and how life works.",anime,1clgxl4

I am looking for something fast paced, addictive and one with a good plot, preferably something of the battle-shounen type, though any other genre would do.

My favorite anime for reference (in no particular order): Attack on Titan (10), Code Geass (10), Jujutsu Kaisen (10), ERASED (8)  I also watched Chainsaw Man and loved it, though i think it has a lot more stuff to show.  Also, demon slayer would probably be an anime that could fit these criteria, but for some reason I did not like it, probably because the story seemed 'bland' or too simple for my tastes.",anime,1cfr4yv
Are there more anime like Akame Ga Kill? I love darker anime where nobody is safe. Makes it less predictable and a real show for me. I especially love it where it’s a Shounen type but more mature.

Unfortunately I haven’t found a battle Shounen that takes the elements of Akame Ga Kill and applies it to their show. Other than JJK of course but nothing else.,anime,1cd3oyx
"Adult Romance Anime’s that aren’t creepy I really love reading romance Manga and my boyfriend has recently gotten me into more anime’s. I’ve loved a lot of different things that he’s been into. I’m in the middle of One Piece (I’ve 600 episodes in like 3 months though so I need a break). But as for “romance” ones or other ones I’ve liked are: Violet Evergarden, Farming Life in Another World (dumb, but really cute), That Time I Got Reincarnated by a Slime (cute but not a romance), Spy Family (kind of a romance? I’m only halfway through season 2), Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian (cute, but high school). We both recently tried to watch My Annoying Senpai and I love about half of it, but it felt creepy and uncomfortable to watch for most of it. We watched nearly 6 episodes and just couldn’t continue. I’ve seen it suggested so many times which is why we decided to try it. We’re hoping to get some suggestions that we can watch so that I can get my romance fix when I need a break from watching One Piece or other ones he loves to watch.   Edit: Adult as in adult characters in a romance. I just get really tired of watching high schoolers in high school scenarios falling in love. They’re still cute to watch sometimes, but I definitely want to watch some that are a little older and more mature falling in love as well.  Edit pt 2: I am fine with creepy in a horror context, but absolutely not in a “this relationship should be illegal” context… That’s how My Annoying Senpai felt for me and him.

"Quality anime series to watch together with a 6 years old daughter So, my daughter is 6. We've just watched Little Witch Academia, and it was a blast, she loved it. I would've shown her TTGL, but I think she's too young for that yet. So, I'd like you to recommend something similar to LWA.  What I would like to see:  – No movies. Yeah, I know about Ghibli, and it's quite easy to find good anime movies for kids without Reddit's help.  – No overly long stuff like One Piece, Naruro, etc. 1-2-3 standart seasons is ok.  – An overarching plot. The slice of life episodic stuff is good, but having a good story to follow is more fun.  – Action is fine, but no bloody/brutal violence. Death is okay of it's not overdone. I mean, the ""Lion King"" level is fine.  – No sexual stuff. Dating, kissing and marrying is good, but perv jokes are not. I mean, I love them, but it's not something I want a kid to see in this age.  – No religious/anti-religious stuff. It's a serious subject, not something I want a 6 y.o. to have in her cartoons.  – Female characters. Well, the MC may be male, but the main ensemble should have at least some girls.  – Humour, expressive faces and slapstick are encouraged.  – The age doesn't matter as long as it looks good enough.  Some series (non-anime uncluded) aside from LWA  that my daughter liked before:  – Pokemon (loved it, but dropped since it was too long)  – Miraculous Ladybug (liked it, but dropped since it was too long)  – My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (loved it)  – Avatar: The Last Airbender (totally loved, watched whole)",anime,1cgomn8

Are there action anime where side characters power scale to the mc and are actually useful against the main antagonists Something that has the opposite of the dragonball effect where only goku matters. Where multiple combatants are fleshed out and can stand on their own. I want something where it's not just screen time but the other characters are on par with the mc. Not like one piece where zoro and sanji get their own cool fights but don't hold a candle to luffy.  Think sports anime power scaling where everyone has crazy talents but for actual physical fights. The closest thing I've seen (well actually read) was rurouni kenshin in the latter half when the rival antagonists (and sanosuke) joined up to help against shishio.  And if there's nothing like this then just name a series with really good power scaling  EDIT: Someone pointed out Fullmetal ALchemist Brotherhood. Something exactly like that.  EDIT 2: demon slayer fits the bill too but I've seen (and read) that already too.  EDIT 3: Not looking for a weak mc that is surrounded by op characters.

"Really and I mean really well written animes Looking for really really well written animes. Like amazing plot, great characters, and no bs.   I’ve seen steins gate, link click, parasyte, aot, vivy, erased, 86, and madoka magica. I think they all had amazing plots. Link click and aot had the best characters. Steins gate, parasyte, vivy, and aot had the best character development.   By no bs, I mean that there aren’t scenes that make you feel like this could have all been avoided with common sense. Like in the first episode of spirit chronicles. >!the girl gets mad at the mc for kidnapping her friend and the mc tries to clarify that she asked him to take her back to her father. Except the mc says “she asked me to” then pauses for a century and in turn the girl responds “why would she ask you to kidnap her?” And he says “lemme finish” then says the SAME DAMN THING and this leads him to get taken to the castle to get beaten and even if he wasn’t trying to pause, JUST TALK OVER HER FOR FUCKS SAKE.!< like I wanted to kms while watching this scene and this everywhere. In madoka magica >!a similar situation occurs where the mc’s friend gets in a big misunderstanding due to the mc NOT FINISHING HER FUCKING STATEMENT.!< yes madoka magica had a good plot but there was some of this shit so it doesn’t rank as highly as the other ones for me. Other things that count as bs are characters not applying basic reasoning and common sense that children are capable of, unnecessary fan service (unless it’s of men. If it’s a shower scene I get it or it’s trying to portray a character a certain way. Fan service around every 1-2 episodes is excessive) and generally stuff that would turn you off from a show or stuff that makes you think this scene really wasn’t written with a functioning brain.   I rate steins gate, link click, parasyte, aot, and vivy 9-10/10, 86 as 8/10, madoka magica and erased 7/10 and am looking for 8-10/10s.

"Recommend me ANY show as long as it doesn't have these things in it After watching a ton of anime, there's a lot of things that I feel like I'm getting tired of. I'm not implying that any of these things are tropes or make it a bad show, I'm just personally bored of seeing it.  So if anyone likes, I'd love if you could recommend an anime that doesn't include any of these things:  - No shows where the main story is traveling to different parts of the world and solving their problems - No shows set in the future or a fantasy world - No shows where everyone likes the MC for no reason other than them being the MC - No shows longer than 30 episodes - No shows without a central story that is being pursued in each episode (no comedy or slice of life) - No battle/card game/competition based shows - No highschool romance (other romance is fine) - No shows with a stoic main character who never shows any emotion - No shows with a cliche main character who does all the generic anime tropes (getting embarrassed from walking into girls bathroom, having super pervy throughs randomly, being the butt of every joke) - And finally, no shows that are ongoing or never got fully adapted. There's nothing more frustrating than getting to the end of a show and realizing there was so much more LN that never got adapted, or you have to wait another 3 years for the next season.  This is a super weirdly specific list, so it's totally understandable if nothing fits this list haha, but just thought I'd ask since most of the recs I get fall under this category.  (This will also prove my theory that nobody actually reads the body of these requests before immediately recommending One Piece or JJBA)",anime,1e00pah
"Anime titles that doesn't directly related to it's story. I want to know more anime titles that seem strange or confusing because they don't really match the story? Maybe the title is totally random, or it hints at something that isn't very important?  I'm so worked up why ""Rascal does not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai"" has that title but I read here on Reddit that it has little to do with the actual plot. I became fascinated by this realization and it reminded me not to take things literally.  Now I got curious what else have this kind of *interesting* titles. Please also include those that are very *ironic* like ""Happy Sugar Life"" where >!in the end!< there's no happy, no sugar and no life.",anime,1cxn4ay
"Looking for a Drama or Slice of Life anime focused on real people with real issues Looking for more anime that have down to earth stories and tones. It can have some supernatural or fantasy, but I'm not looking for something super out there like an Isekai at this time.    Something like March Comes in Like a Lion, Your Lie in April, Monster, or even Anohana is fine.  Thanks guys!",anime,1ctetm2
"Fantasy anime that isn't isekai? I've been looking for some good fantasy anime, but haven't been able to find anything that exactly fits my tastes right now.  **Some things I like/dislike:**  I'm not really a fan of the isekai genre, but I *do* like ""main character discovers there's a magical side to the 'normal' reality they're used to"" (think Rin from Blue Exorcist learning demons are real type deal). For setting, I prefer past or present over future.  I also like magic that has a specific system, like types of magic or various types of spellcasters.  I prefer adult protagonists, but I'm desperate enough it's not a complete dealbreaker.  I'm open to things that are flexible with my criteria, though! Trying to find some fun stuff to watch.  Lastly, I'm fine with romance but it's not really *the* make or break thing for me.  My only hard no is adult/minor relationships. It's not for me.  **Some anime I've liked in the past and why, if it helps:**  \-Magi (Labyrinth/Kingdom of Magic): Excellent world building and character development. Even minor, background characters caught my attention. I liked the unique take on past folklore with it adapting 1,001 Nights but not sticking so closely to the source material it felt the same.  \-Fate/Zero: Similar to Magi, I really liked the adaptation of past folklore.  \-Blue Exorcist: The worldbuilding did it for me with this one. I loved the integration of various religions/schools of thought into a neat world system.  \-Vanitas no Carte: Vampires are really cool, and this one was emotionally compelling and offered fresh takes with some vampires having unique abilities. The animation style is also gorgeous.  \-Tiger and Bunny: Incredibly compelling story line and unique cast of characters. I liked the storyline they had going on with NEXT oppression.  \-Moriarty the Patriot: Again, loved the unique spin on stories that have already been told. Adult main cast is a plus. I liked the complicated takes on morality and class divides.  Thank you so much for anyone who has suggestions!  Edit to add: I REALLY liked the character type of Yunan from Magi and would love to see a show with another character like him. It's a bit hard to describe unless you've seen Magi, but think of sort of silly, kind mentor figures who are very powerful and know a lot about the world.  Also edited to correct incorrect information about an anime I watched a while ago.",anime,1gp1o5c

Anime where a normal guy trains and gets stronger So I'm looking for any anime that's basically a training montage across a few seasons.

"Looking for scary anime to watch tonight with one critical scene to avoid My daughter (adult) and Iove watching anime and are looking to watch some scary anime.  We've watched loads of all genres but have been nervous about just watching any show because there's one thing we avoid at all cost in any media.  It cannot have any hanging scenes.  None. Which is a challenge at times when watching shows of any media TBH.  I always search parents guide on IMDb, does the dog die and common sense reviews on order to filter as much as possible but even that isn't 100% perfect.   If it's only one episode and we know about it we can skip or fast forward, we do that when we watch detective Conan.  So hopefully you all can recommend supernatural, horror or yokai anime that are scary that have no hanging scenes at all.  No ecchi or super excessive fan service either please.

What we've watched so far was monster, shadows House, many others that are yokai but not really scary (noragami, jjk, kakuriyo, undead murder farce, etc).",anime,1ggnnj1

Personally for me it’s Bungou Stray Dogs because of the diversity and complexity in the characters, the unpredictable and wonderful plot, it’s unique interplay of comedy and tragedy, the rejection of archetypes, the wide range of themes it conveys and deals with, and the overall enjoyment (I mean who doesn’t like crazy detective stuff with magical abilities?- it’s got everything) :)",anime,1dhvr3w

"Ordinary slice of life So I've been watching quite a few slice of anime animes/mangas recently, and I've noticed that a lot of them have a gimmick. Like either one of the MCs is a reward winning genius artist/musician/scientist/etc who'll do super wacky things. Or usually the girl is the most popular, beautiful, girl in school who's working as a part time model.   I'm looking for a slice of life anime or manga where everyone is just a regular person.   What I mean is like :  Insomniacs after School - From what I remember, they were both pretty average.  Pastel - Manga where super ordinary guy meets a pretty girl who's somewhat popular, but no guys glare at him in jealously when they're obviously close.

"Anime with a cool female cast(/mc)? Most of the shows I watch are very male centered. Sometimes there are cool female characters included, but they’re basically always a minority and get pushed aside for the main male characters. A lot of anime with a mainly female cast is very clearly targeted basically only to men, and while there isn’t necessarily anything wrong with that it’s just usually not the type of writing that appeals to me.  A few days ago me and my brother started watching Akiba Maid War and it’s actually really cool. It may not be that deep, but it’s entertaining, and I realised it has what I have been wanting to see: girls doing cool shit. They have their own goals, develop and have their arcs, and while they’re appealing it feels like they’re actual characters instead of just existing to maybe be the best selling waifu of the season. Made me wonder if there is more stuff like this out there that I am just unaware of. Another one I really like is Black Lagoon. The women in that show are just cool as hell.  Anybody know any similar anime? Would be nice if most of the cast consisted of women, but them just being very central would be fine too.  Some of my favorite anime include Bungou Stray Dogs, Haikyuu, Demon Slayer, FMAB, HxH, and Vanitas no Karte, so something with a vibe in that direction would be nice. In the end as long as the writing is good I’m not too picky about genres etc, even kiddy stuff goes if the writing has quality   Edit: woah I’m actually getting so many good recommendations. Replying to everyone would make me feel really obnoxious, but I am so thankful for these. I had kind of given up on the hope of finding more good female centred series due to being exposed to so much,, trash really, so I’m so happy to now how so many things to check out. I’m noting these on a list, so even if I don’t reply to you specifically, your recommendation is very much appreciated!",anime,1dsurek

"Any anime with a washed up or untalented older/middle aged protagonist? I just finished watching Kaiju No.8 and  even though I didn't find it to be all that great, I loved the focus on a middle aged protagonist who wasn't all that great still trying to find value in themselves in life, or still trying to achieve their dreams.   I've been having a rough time finding good anime to get into lately. I feel like I've been burned out on the young 16-20 something prodigy coming to save all the older guys cause he was destined for it kind of shit. I think I had my fill for those kinds of stories.  I want to see some grown ass loser find his way to still make an impression through all the chaos.   I don't really care if the theme is realistic or not. I just don't want the average shounen prodigy protagonist. Just some average joe who found a way in the mix somehow and naturally builds himself up to be relevant amongst the cast (or not).

"Spy x Family but with Actual Romance All the anime couples I've seen are so awkward and terrified of one another.  After 36 seasons the cumination of their will they/won't they is something like the guy saying ""I think you look nice today"" and the girl acting as though no one, ever, has ever said anything so kind to her in her life.  Then they smile quietly at each other and credits roll.  Super unsatisfying.  I'm really enjoying Spy x Family right now (anime) but I'm to understand that 26 books later (I like hyperbole) there's still no actual romance and we're supposed to be okay with it because they're both bunglers.  Well, I've had enough, people!  I want an anime where the characters are cute and they can have a slow burn but they eventualy quite clearly and unequivocally say they love each other and kiss and it's clear they're a couple!!  Notes:  1. An anime, please, not a manga.  I rarely get time to read anymore and I consume most of my media with my wife! 2. I don't want anime porn.  Let's not go black-or-white here!  Surely there's a middle ground between 142 episodes of awkward bumbling and immediate sex with a multi-penised monster, isn't there? 3. I don't think I want a straight-up romance with no other storyline.  It would be great for it to be a nonromance anime but have a romance in it that actually pays off.  ...I'm just not a romance anime kind of guy, I'm afraid, and I don't think my wife is romance anime kind of gal.  We need fantasy, adventure, sci-fi, horror, or some other genre that happens to have the romance in it!  Like Kenshin, but he actually acts like he loves Kaoru.

Today I wanted to discuss a specific genre of anime called shock humor as it’s basically when an anime does things that are meant to be outrageous or offensive, but it turns out to be utterly hilarious instead of mean.

It can get bonus points if cute girls suffering from really bad fate too.  already watched madoka, yuuki yuuna, shiki, parasyte, higurashi no naku koro ni psycho pass, serial experiments lain and evangelion.   not necessarily looking for something like those animes but rather what I described (main character going insane and making unethical decisions under extreme situations and suffering and going insane)",anime,1g5w3nj
"Anime with not so hardworking/lazy protagonist Hello!  Need some anime recommendation where the protagonist is not a ""hardworking"" type that has to always work their ass off to get where they need to be. Not like Naruto (before Shippuden mostly) or Haikyu where the protagonist isn't really ""gifted"" and just needs to grind their ass off to get to the top, I mean the exact opposite of that.

Looking for romance as main focus, preferably with little action or superpowers and whatnot. Don't mind ecchi or harem, though they tend to be a bit worse story wise. Also it'd be cool if there were more affection other than a kiss or a confession in the last episode. Drama is no issue either.

An anime or manga about a world where everything is slightly “off”?

"Isekai, whether anime or manga, wherein the protagonist was satisfied with their old life, and is not happy to have been reincarnated? Most isekai tend to have their protagonist realize that they have been reincarnated, practically jump for joy, and then eagerly run off to begin their new adventures in a wonderous fantasy world, meeting all sorts of quirky new friends and enemies along the way. They never seem to struggle with cultural clash in their new world, nor are they ever saddened by the fact that *they will never see their old family or friends again*.  I'm looking for isekai with meaningfully reluctant protagonists, who, for any number of reasons, have significant reservations about their reincarnation, rather than being immediately accepting and happy about it. Possible reasons for this may include:  1. They come from Japan, an extremely developed, peaceful, and safe nation from the 21st century, and are having trouble coping with the brutal realities of a medievalesque setting.  2. They deeply loved their family and friends, and they are now mournful over the fact that they will never see any of them again.  3. They considered themselves to have been quite successful and/or fulfilled in life, and view it as wildly unfair that they have now lost everything they worked to have in life.  I understand that isekai is all about escapism, and thus this would more or less defeat the point of the genre, but I think that this could be a fairly interesting concept, and I'm hoping that *someone* out there has explored it.  EDIT: I'm getting so many replies that I don't think I could really respond each individual one without my comments becoming repetitive, but, as a whole, thank you for any and all recommendations or suggestions!

"Are there any normal-ish female action main characters (doesn’t have to be protag just main cast member) who fight mainly via bruiser-style punching?

Nami, Nobara, Maki (JJK one), Maka, Tsubaki, Robin, Madoka, Mikasa, etc. Yet I’ve noticed there’s virtually no overlap between the two groups. The female characters might sometimes punch someone but it’s rare. Most female action show characters fall into one or multiple of the following categories:  - Weapon users, like Maka or Nobara  - Mainly uses acrobatic fighting styles that involve mostly kicks, like Boa Hancock (not a main character but still)  - Uses a power / gadgets / intelligence to fight, like Nami or Robin  - Non-fighters who avoid combat, are weak / cowardly, etc.  The only female characters I can think of who fight using their fists, like Bisky, aren’t main cast members. I’m also sure dragon ball has a few but that’s already on my watch list.

"What’s your favorite anime that changes genres? Basically I am referring to shows that change their genre at some point as picture an anime series that starts off as an ordinary slice of life based show, BUT then very slowly the same show turns into a sci fi based show as the show transforms into something not only different in tone, but manages to make it work.     I don’t know what the trope is called for such a series, but to me, it’s a very interesting way to catch the viewer by surprise because if done right, it can make a show a lot more fascinating to watch again due to the genre shift, so yeah just wanted to discuss such shows in here, if it’s acceptable.",anime,1cuh36v

But recently they have shown an interest in anime after catching the newest season of Slime Tensei while I was watching it. Then I put on Mashle to kind of play in the background since I've already read the manga and they ended up binging and finishing it even after I left. Now they want to know what to watch next and I don't want to scare them off or bore them from anime. What do you guys think would be good for beginners based on the previous ones? And ofc stuff with minimal fanservice.",anime,1gjydxg
"Most Upsettingly Violent Anime? I'm sure this has already been asked a billion and a half times, but my morbid curiosity compelled me to find some f'd up and sickly gory anime. I love - Attack on Titan - but it's more fully fleshed in its presentation despite the terror you see on screen and has a more melodrama approach and I feel more feelings than just ""ew violence"".  I'm not sure if it gets love but - Blood C - made me queasy AF and I haven't found one piece of Anime media to match how f'd up and sick I felt. The way it's made is completely indifferent to all the violence that's shown, even if some of the characters are silly the reactions and voice acting really feels ""raw and real"" if something as chaotic as this happened in real life. I always tell myself ""never again"" but still revisit it on occasion and it still revolts and offends like no other anime. Cheers in advance!",anime,1gdig2b

"What anime has clearly defined superpower rules and abuse of technicalities? My favorite example is Death Note, where you have clear Death Note rules which users test and work around like having other people write down names of pieces of Death Note paper, or discovering new rules about delayed killing and killing methods.  Another example is dragonball, where they have an entire system where they discuss what the wishes should be, about using the first to teleport someone, then the second to revive them at a now safer place. Or even finding the dragonballs, where they detect power levels to determine where people with dragonballs are going or have been, combining with the dragonball radar, and knowing which people can detect stuff and who can't.",anime,1e9p620

It doesn't need to be a sports anime, but I just want an anime where the characters are constantly trying to get better like in Haikyuu, Shokugeki no Soma, Blue Lock, Demon Slayers, where they practice a lot, get better, and practice even more.   The only one I could kinda think of was K-on, but in k-on they don't have this drive and fire to win, like the animes I mentioned, k-on is more of a chill slice-of-life.

There was a day when she would be checked of whats her capability, and she was seen as worst, so her parents decide to sacrifice her, but she flees. I forgot much about it, but there is an episode where she was exploring a town, and all the town guards liked her as a child, like they helped her get something like a pass, and also helped her when the adventurer's camp outside the city was raided.   Her village was in ruins, and her village had a special delicacy, maybe a fruit, which bought her memories about how she would've killed, ad how she fleed the town, something along those lines",anime,1g4ww7e

"Looking for anime with extremely lively cast (must have more than 12 eps) I'm looking for animes that have well developed characters across the board. You can have side-side characters obviously, as is natural and necessary for any story. However all main characters and main-side characters should be fairly developed and serve an actual role in the story rather than being cared about for just 1 real scene, before you forget about them forever. If their role is comedy, you can include it if they're damn good at it.  I'm looking for a cast (between like 5-10 people for example. That number is semi-flexible) that feels like a family with how close they are(even if not initially) and how natural their interactions feel.(if there's a good romance in there then all the better).   If it's a romance anime with a smaller cast then I'd like it to have at least ,maybe a likeable best-friend/siblings of the male and female MCs respectively. If only one of them has friends it kinda ticks me off cuz it gives ""perfect boy/girl shortchanging themselves by dating the loser boy/girl"" vibes ,and I hate that. I actually want to be able to see in the male/female love interest what their partner sees in them. If one person in the ship is extremely dominant,smart,pretty etc. and the other is  half-useless then I'm not seeing that at all.   The 7 best examples(of what I'm looking for) from things I've already watched: (in no particular order)  Kaguya Love is War (seriously these guys are sooo good together. One of my favorites romances as well. I also like that there's POVs/narration for male and FeMC which makes them both deeper, instead of just Kaguya getting the POVs. Heck even Ishigami and Chika get frequent internal monologues)   Avatar TLA (everyone is competent and serves at least a somewhat major role in every arc. The power dynamics are also fairly balanced and no one feels like wasted space in fights)  Fruits basket (family politics + romance all done extremely well. Crazy likeable and/or interesting side characters)   Tokyo revengers (intense cool factor to the central cast and strong friendships while not feeling forced. Also has romance)  Saiki K (these guys are too comedic together fr. I wish the 2nd season onwards had a dub. Comedy anime kinda needs it in my eyes since some of the jokes technically need localisation to land harder)  Konosuba: (absolute clowns man)   Toaru Series: (half the main-side characters literally get their own spinoffs and become MC level deep because they literally are the MCs in said spinoffs)   **Please indicate if the anime you suggest has an English dub or not. Depending on my mood I sometimes settle for sub, but I still prefer dubs.**   Ps: No Harems",anime,1gt2lva
Romance Anime where the MC and the Girl hates each other at first then falls in love with each other later on? Whats a good one that you can suggest? hatred to love type of anime,anime,1gnlc1q
"Anime where at least one important moment happens outside of Japan? I know, really specific, but it would be also important if the place would actually exist in our world. So no Sword Art Online or Isekai.  The only to thing that came to my mind:  JoJo's Bizarre Adventure  Monster",anime,1gmys43
"seeking an anime that's intensely cringey yes i know this question's been asked many times before but i come to you with a more specific purpose. i am seeking animes which are not cringey in the sense of having lots of boobies or terrible romance animes. but instead animes which are corny and cringey for other reasons. bonus points for: animes that are corny cringey or outright stupid but taking themselves very seriously, terrible dialogue, terrible voice acting. your recommendations are appreciated.",anime,1gjl0k8
Anime with best dragon representation? I’m looking for anime with really good or interesting takes on dragons. A couple i can think of off the top of my head are Shenron and Igneel/Achnologia. I saw the one dragon represented early on in Frieren but the dragon was seemingly unintelligent and had no screen presence. It was only on-screen for a few seconds and its existence was much more for the characters than itself. I also remember seeing dragons in season 1 of Ancient Magus Bride but those were relatively unmemorable. Sorry if what I’m seeking is unclear but i’m really looking for a serious and interesting portrayal of dragons in a decent anime. Thanks in advance!,anime,1gamaq1
"I need anime’s that aren’t violent, or pervy I love anime but it’s really hard to find shows that aren’t  1.) sexualizing minors 2.) constantly depicting sexual assault or harassment  3.) very violent and gory  I’m looking for fun, happy anime’s that aren’t serious.

"What are you guys favorite romantic anime that subvert common tropes of the genre? Just wanted to have a simple discussion on the genre as I sometimes hear from people in English speaking countries that say that every romantic anime always has a jealous girl character in the lead, and then it suddenly got me wondering if there was a romantic anime series where the clingy archetype was subverted in some way.     To put it simply, I don’t mind romantic anime series that feature a clingy jealous girl as one of the major characters as I am cool with those kind of shows, but I was just curious if there were shows that changed the archetype a bit instead as it’s hard to explain, but I wanted to explore some romantic anime that did things a bit differently.",anime,1fo20bi

"Anime where the mc doesn't ignore girls but also does be weird about them The trope where the mc gets embarrassed when seeing a woman pisses me off.

"Does anyone know what the name for this anime movie was? I watched the movie 6 years ago so the details are a bit foggy.  It was an action/romance anime movie where certain individuals could obtain magical powers. The main character's brother or friend intends to kill him and steal his girlfriend. Midway through the movie, the protagonist loses his powers. His mother helps him regain them through training, using a ring that slowly drains her life because she lost her powers many years ago. She dies in the process, I think. In the end, the protagonist defeats the villain, but time reverses, causing his girlfriend to forget him.  Edit:Not sure if this post is nsfw coz people for sure die in the movie.   Edit 2: Mc has special abilities and goes to a school with his friend and girlfriend. His mother used to be the top person with abilities but she lost her powers. Someone is trying to kill the mc but he survives. MC's friend's sister also joins the school. Mc loses his abilities but his mother teaches him again by using a ring that kills her, she dies. Mc fights and kills the bad guy, but time reverses or something idk but his girlfriend forgets him. In the end credits I think the mc finds his girlfriend and it's hinted that she starts to remeber him  Edit 3: It was a modern anime. I watched it in like 2016 or 17. I don't remember if the powers had names. It took place in modern time. Their abilities weren't shunned, like some people could use abilities  and some couldn't, but there wasn't any dissemination. I would say it was both fantasy and scifi. The main characters hair was black or brownish possibly. I don't think he had any scars or anything, and they didn't have any accessories like hats or glasses.",anime,1ejvc7u

They don't really like magic, they're into sci-fi, action, or funny animes. We watched anime together before, but I would love to have more recommendations if possible!

OK... to start, I normally don't even like anime but I something about Apothecary Diaries struck a cord with me and I watched all 24 episodes in one day.

It stayed with me since and coincidentally I watched some animes that reminded me of it a lot.  It was Ranking of Kings, The Weakest Tamer, Baby and Me, and Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Basically the premise is like One Punch Man in that instead of focusing on a virtually unstoppable protagonist, the premise is about a normal person who goes on a quest to slay the most powerful being as said being is so powerful he can destroy the world if he wants to.     It’s kind of like the concept of the Disgaea games as those games are about making the most powerful characters, and then it got me wondering what would happen if there was an anime series about a super powerful character that brags about being powerful enough to conquer planets, yet someone is brave enough to oppose him. It’s  kind of like what would happen if Saitama was a bad guy that was using his powers for pure evil.",anime,1hizszn

"Anime/Manga with dominant women/woman? + submissive men/man I want to start by saying that yes, I know this question is asked into oblivion in this subreddit, to the point that you might want to just throw the hentai book at me. However, I have seen some of those posts, I think my criteria/interests have slight differences for what exactly I'm searching for.   To start with, the female characters I am looking for would be dominant, leading and contradictory from how traditional heterorelationships are usually perceived (saving him like a heroine for example is something that might fit that story that I'm searching for). Dominant as in personality + intimacy (to not sound vulgar..) in the relationship. The story should not wind up with the main goal making the male character eventually ""taking control"". I know it's tough finding such stories, but if possible, fanservice/male gaze at minimum. Preference would be the woman/women character/s being older/taller, but obviously not a must, I'm just making myself cringe here, unapologetically. This isn't restricted to mcs either.   Three animes I saw from previous posts but I personally exclude from this are Future Diary (great horror/thriller though), Please don't-Nagatoro (she's just bullying him..), and Dangers in my heart (they're ""switches"" to me honestly).",anime,1ewfdor

"I'm looking for a very specific anime I realize that this is a bit of an odd request however, since I am a big fan of architecture and especially urban planning, I wanted to know if you knew of an anime in which the city is also featured.  I mean an anime in which a lot of weight is given to cityscapes or in which the peculiar structure or conformation of the city has a weight in the plot or simply an anime in which the city is very well represented graphically.  I would tend to prefer it to be a romantic anime however, anything but overly demented works is fine.

Am not interested in that...  Death Note had some moments where Light and L genuinely failed or blundered, Code Geass had moments where Lelouch's arrogance also proved to fuck him many times.   Kaiji is a prime example of the show I am looking for...Kaiji loses many times but even when he plans, it's never guaranteed whether or not he would succeed or not and many times fails at the worst possible moment, This makes him more human...He is not that smart but when he is smart...he is freaking smart.",anime,1hbbqcb

"Parent-friendly completed animes? I’m on a journey to induct my parents into anime, and it’s going somewhat well.   Started off horribly with Demon Slayer - I love it but they couldn’t stand Dub Zenitsu. They didn’t even make it to Mugen Train.  I thought AOT would go better because it’s way more “serious” - and it did by a mile. Just finished it, only OVAs to go, and besides general complaints which the entire fandom has had at points, they loved it.  They’ve also both watched some of Death Note dubbed which they liked.  They’re pretty conservative, so it’s hard to find things to watch. Of course any nudity or sex is an instant no. LGBTQ themes make for such an awkward watch cause I have to laugh along and pretend I hate it.   That basically crosses off all isekai and “child-ish” shonen. Any fanservice is a no.   I’ve been trying to put together a list of things to suggest but need some help. Here’s what I’ve got so far.  Shows I have never watched: - Steins;Gate - Full Metal Alchemist - Monster  Shows I have watched: - Fate Stay Night (-> UBW -> HF)  I’m iffy about FSN because there are a few explicit scenes, but they do mainly deal with serious themes so it should be fine.   HxH also seems like a good idea, but they hate starting incomplete things. I’ve also given One Piece a thought lmao. Never started it but it could be a good long-term investment.   Also considered Vinland Saga and Cowboy Bebop but I can’t tell if they’re actually complete and don’t want to spoil myself lmao.  Appreciate the help in advance :)  Edit: A lot of people have been suggesting Ghibli, and while it’s not an objectively bad idea I’m more looking for daily investment.

"Looking for a good anime based on my favourite anime so far? **Some of my favourite anime:**  * One Piece * Steins Gate * Your Lie in April * Attack on Titan * Kuroko no Basket(Haikyuu was good too)  **Some anime that i dropped:**  * Demon Slayer(dropped at ep. 20) * Jujutsu Kaisen(dropped at ep. 10) * Re:Zero(dropped it around season 2) * Frieren(dropped at ep. 17) * Fruits Basket(dropped at ep. 10) * Monster(dropped at around ep. 30)     **Good anime but not my favourites:**  * Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood * AnoHana * Angel Beats * Hunter x Hunter * Fate Zero and Fate Stay Night * Naruto * Charlotte  One more thing: I hate anime where you kinda know that everything will be fine. I don't know if this is what people call a ""feel-good"" anime but most of the time I have found them to be extremely boring.",anime,1dml387
"What’s a super unpopular horror/psychological anime that messes with your head that you like? I’m talking about stuff that’s less popular than lain. I know lain is relatively popular, but a surprising amount of people don’t know it. So I would like something that barely any people know, but it would still be a really interesting watch. Thanks in advance!",anime,1dm8x21
"Fantasy animes where they're just wandering? Thinking something like ""Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina"" or even ""Frieren"". Those 2 are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head that fit what I'm looking for. Lastly I prefer if it's either a solo protag or two people, i.e I really like the beginning of Frieren when it was just Frieren and Fern.  And ""wandering"" can be broad they can have a set journey in mind but, I'd like if each episode they were at a new location or within 2 episodes at least.",anime,1d6g8ca
"What did I miss from 2022? Catching up. In my younger years, I was watching anime almost nonstop, but sort of drifted off. Now I’m catching up to the seasons I missed (alongside watching shows I believe are interesting regardless of years), and have now almost finished the last show I had planned for the 2021 seasons. Which gets me started on 2022, therefore:   **(TL;DR) Which of the 2022 anime shows (continuing or new) should I add to the list below?**   **To watch**   - Jojo: ~~Star~~ Stone Ocean (thank you for the correction!) - Hakozume: Koban Joshi no Gyakushuu - Summer Time Render - Aoashi - Dance Dance Danseur - Birdie Wing - Gunjou no Fanfare - Meitantei Conan: Zero no Nichijou - Lycoris Recoil - Made in Abyss season 2 - Warau Arsnotoria Sun—! - Chainsaw Man - Boku no Hero Academia season 6 - Bocchi the Rock - Fumetsu no Anata e season 2 - Golden Kamuy season 4 - Kokyu no Karasu  **Already watched from 2022**  - Kimetsu no Yaiba: Yuukaku-hen - Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season Part 2 - Ousama Ranking  - Vanitas no Carte 2nd Cour - Spy x Family (both cours) - Deaimon  - Blue Lock - Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen  **Favourite genres**  - Slice of Life  - Fantasy  - Adventure  - Sports  **Please don’t recommend** any self insert / overpowered Isekai shows, romance oriented or satire / heavy comedy shows, as they are genres I heavily struggle with and rarely enjoy save for a fair few.   Thank you in advance!   P.S. [link]( to my anime list if it’s needed / relevant.   Edit:   Adding the below to the “To Watch” list:   - Cyberpunk Edgerunners   - Gundam Witch From Mercury  - Made in Abyss film   - Kotarou wa Hitorigurashi  Whatever isn’t scratched off will be getting the 25% test:   - Tokyo Revengers   - Ya Boy Kongming!  ~~- My Dress-Up Darling~~  - Link Click   - Rust Eater Bisco  ~~- Tomodachi Game~~  - Akiba Maid Wars  ~~- Call of the Night~~  - Kaguya-Sama  - Lycoris Recoil  Edit 2:   Thank you all for your help, I believe that I’m now ready to continue the catch up journey.   **Edit 3 and Updates for the trial anime:**   - Dropped Bisco after episode 5. The world and action remain interesting and fun, but I don’t like the characters or care about the story enough to want to stay for 7 more eps.   - Watched the first season of Link Click and I don’t believe that I’ll be watching the second one. Xiaoshi is an incredibly frustrating character to follow at times, there aren’t enough explanations about the abilities, or the photo jumping and some of the rules seemingly getting broken on a whim is not a good thing. I do like that they adapted real life stories in some episodes though and the visuals.   - Dropped Kaguya-sama after episode 3. As expected the anime title and description didn’t lie when it said *what* this will be about and [I’m not a fan of these genres]( whatsoever. The comedy was nonexistent to me as well, which the commenter who recommended it said will make the stay worthwhile. Overall, not for me.   - Finished Ya Boy Kongming and after a boring first episode, I’m surprised that it made such a great comeback. I enjoyed the music for the most past part (>! Despite the rap feeling out of place, not a big fan of it in general honestly, and Still Alive Today getting old so quickly!<), the characters and the journey.   - Dropped Tokyo Revengers after episode 6. It was so cringeworthy watching children act like adults, really didn’t like the minuscule consequences to the >!time travel!< aspect when it should have been the complete opposite and didn’t care about the characters to want to go any further either.   - Put Akiba on hold after episode 7. It was great in episodes 1-4, but 5-7 for some reason flipped that enjoyment over its head. The weird thing here is that nothing actually changed much in the show’s progression or flow to warrant such change in enjoyment. I don’t want to continue now, but maybe someday, I might come back to finish it off.   - Dropped Lycoris Recoil after episode 3. The visuals and action remained consistently good, but the episodes felt like a chore to watch. Add the usual“mean girls” trope alongside the no-kill philosophy and my interest just plummeted.   And with that, I’m done with all the trial anime and can start with the original list above. Thank you all for your help and will hopefully be making another thread for the 2023 anime.",anime,1d1243k
"It's been a really long time since I watched a good anime thats recent. Recommend something. It's been so long since Ive seen a really good anime please give me an anime under these types  For example even tho those animes are not my top 10 even but I like them and watched them like last year   Genre: mystery plus/or powers  Examples:  * Summer time rendering  * 91 days  * Odd Taxi * Demon slayer   I want a recent anime that came out last 2 years max and it's actually good   I like mystery and I like action or tournament of like example Boku no hero or like action if demon slayer . Along those lines  My top 5 if that helps ( in order)  1- One Piece  2- Monster  3- Fullmetal Alchemist   4- Hunter X Hunter  5- Detective Conan + Katekyo Hitman Reborn ( nostalgia love them too much lol)  I watched the popular ones like chainsaw man it was mid at best , aot was amazing got weird ending, jujutsu is just overrated.  Hopefully there are new anime last 8 seasons like 2 years that are good that I didn't notice for example I watched summertime not knowing at all how good it was and it was on going at that time .

"Just finished all three seasons of ""My teen romantic comedy snafu. "" This never felt like a comedy or a romance anime to me mainly a drama and a mighty good ne at that . Though there was one joke that made me completely lost it when hiki said, "" He must be american "" This show is now a favourite and one i plan to rewatch in a few months to catch things i missed on my first viewing .  What are some shows that are the total opposite to snafu ? While i enjoyed it alot hiki was alot to handle and he was a very unique MC, and was someone i could relate to strongly but now i'm left with tonal whiplash. So what's a somewhat good anime with solid romance/comedy  that is wholesome and has a happy ending ?     There can be some character drama throughout that's what makes things interesting but it needs to have a light hearted feeling mostly.     Eamples of what i am thinking are :  &#x200B;  1.

"Help me find an anime i used to love Theres an anime i used to watch around 2014-15, it was targeted towards 8-14 year olds (roughly) and was about fighting monsters (think pokemon/yugioh), the main character was looking for his dad, who went missing when he was a child and is believed to be in this alternate magical world where all the monsters originally come from,but that no human had ever visited. His dad also used to work for a shadow organisation dedicated to studying and training the monsters, which the MC then also worked with while trying to find his dad. It had a late 90's to mid 00's animation style (closest i can find is something like the first season of code geass).

I hate the traditional shonen style male protagonist (Sora from no game no life and Kirito from Sword Art Online to name a couple) So I would really prefer a more female centered story. If there is going to be a male character, he needs to not be annoying and every girl in the anime needs to not be in love with him. I love magical girl style of shows or anything that involves slightly revealing costumes and cool battle scenes. I love sci-fi type settings or any type of demon girls (bonus points if there is a succubus). I would absolutely love something resembling Rosario + Vampire or Highschool DXD but just without the male protagonist. Please no slice-of-life and keep the harem to a minimum (Unless it's a harem of all girls or you can testify that the male lead is not an annoying prick).

"Seeking the Mysterious VHS Anime Tape: Girl Falling with Torn Pants & Bare Butt from the Year 2000 **Does anyone know of an anime VHS tape from back in the day with a cover showing a girl falling, her pants tearing, and her bare butt exposed?** I swear I saw it at the video store as a kid around the year 2000 and spent way too much time wondering what \*exactly\* it was about (purely for research purposes, of course).  I do recall this copy of Outlaw Star being on the same shelf, if that helps.   [  I do not think it was an ""Adult Anime Movie"" as it was within arm's reach for a 5 year old to grab. However, I do think it would have some ecchi moments, particularly because the cover art featured a butt, which I found funny as a kid.  I will include an AI reference image of what I think it looked like, I can’t say it was exactly this pose, it could definitely be different in some ways.   [  **I can try to share more details from what I recall, though I might be misremembering some things:**  \- The environment was dark.  \- The girl was the only character on the cover.  \- The clothing on her bum was torn off.  \- I believe her hair was black.  \- I think she was falling off a cliff toward a pit of spikes or something similar.  \- I think she was wearing a bodysuit.  \- Also, I saw this VHS tape in a Video Rental store(Called Movie World in Henderson Tennessee) around the year 2000, likely 2002 when I was around 5-6.",anime,1hgszao
"Strength vs magic type animes? I just finished Wistoria: Wand and Sword and it was the greatest name I've seen in awhile. I ADORE the whole ""This entire world is built on magic and the MC just happens to be super strong physically and is incapable of using magic"" trope(?). Another example being Mashle: Magic and Muscles.   Both are set in some magic school, but thats a loose requirement.   I'd prefer something a bit more serious than Mashle, more like Wistoria but I know this is a bit specfic so I'm a little desprate for any genre with this premise.   Please and thank you!!!  Edit: as I'm reading some suggestions, a character who defies the laws of the word is basically what I'm looking for. The Wrong way to use healing magic, as someone suggested, has the same appeal to me. An MC that is using the ""wrong"" type of strength, according to their world.

"Animes that begin very sad/tragic but slowly evolves to happiness. You get the usual idea, a very or usually happy start where the MC and the other characters have stupid fun and basically, it's just a good time for everyone and especially for the viewer. Sort of like a fanservice. But then, that was just a warmup or breather for what's about to come when the story gets deeper or more intense. And then we're hit with the bittersweet or sad ending, and leave us with a good story.  You know, I'm tired of this shit. I'm not saying that the idea is getting old, I Just can't take the sad shit anymore. To get to the point, I want an anime OR if there's one that's basically the opposite of the idea above. It starts off sad or tragic, you get the idea, and it gives off the idea that it might as well just end off bad, but it actually gets better, and the anime is left on a good note!

"Self sacrifice for a huge power up. One of my favorite anime tropes is when a character effectively ends their own life for a huge power up to beat a much stronger opponent. I like the resolve of a character knowing that what they are going to do will kill them and martyring themself anyway. It’s even better if the character actually does die, in all my examples they sort of ass-pulled a way for the character to survive. IMO the animes would have been better if the character actually died. Except maybe HxH because Gon can’t die without finding his father. Some examples I’ve already watched are:   -Might opening the 8th gate in Naruto Shippuden,   -The Gon vs. Pitou fight where Gon uses all the power he will ever have to beat Pitou  - the end of Kaberneri of the Iron fortress when Icoma injects himself with blood to go save Mumei.   -Choji taking the red pill in Naruto.

I wonder if they even exist, I know sci-fi anime exist obviously, it's Japan after all.

"Calm anime that has deep/emotional elements I want to feel like a part of me was taken while watching it, and I’d love it if it’s sad or emotional at times. They don’t have to be sad exactly, just something that will leave me pondering about it. I don’t really care for fights much, also the less fan service the better.

"Suggest me some anime please! Leaving my top 4 here, along with some info! Anime that I like, ranked:  1. Attack on titan 2. Kaiju no. 8 3. Promised Neverland 4. Tomodachi game  You get the idea. I tend to like anime where there's a big secret that you get to find out. Strange, unsettling characters are a plus, like the titans, the mom, the tomodachi game host, etc. Crazy plot twists are always appreciated, as well as an unpredictable ending. I like people behaving in strange ways which are somehow still true to their character.  Basically, I love fully fleshed out worlds where you can really feel immersed in that world while watching, with lots of twists and turns and interesting characters!  If any of this rang any bells please let me know!!!",anime,1fbkvr6

"Looking for a decently long anime that is carried by its character development I’ve recently been loving anime where characters grow in a certain skill (say a sport or profession) throughout the show, and it centres on the character getting better and better at this skill. I’d prefer if the show didn’t only focus on them developing their skill, but also showed their personal life and relationships with other characters. I’d prefer if the anime was 40+ episodes.  For example, Cross Game was an anime that I absolutely loved. It shows the MC Kitamura Ko getting better at baseball, but also heavily shows his personal life and friendships with other characters.  Another example would be Glass Mask (2005), where the MC Kitajima Maya gets better as an actress but her personal life is just as big as the acting part of the show.  I absolutely LOVED Chihayafuru, this show was incredible. Chihaya Ayase gets into the sport of Karuta and meets her old friends and there’s a love triangle subplot. It’s such a great show.   I can’t think of any other shows that were like these, and I absolutely adored these shows. An example of what people might think but is not what I want are shows like Haikyuu and Kuroko no Basket, as they don’t really delve into the MCs personal lives and are strictly just sport shows. If anyone can think of anime’s like these three, I’d greatly appeciate it! It can be any genre, or any profession, it doesn’t really matter though I’d prefer if there was not too much action.",anime,1dmtq19

"Are there any battle shonen where the bad guys are NOT overconfident all the time? Hey everyone !  I always had a soft spot for battle shonen, I've read/seen a lot of them (not all mind you), but there's a trope I really can't stand anymore, it's the overconfident bad guy who believes he's immortal and can't get beaten by the MC only to then be beaten by the MC.   For some manga/anime it's every single fight that goes like this   >*Bad guy : laughs meancingly*   Bad guy : Hahahaha the likes of you can't ever hurt me, there's nothing you can do to win this fight   *MC : does a thing*   Bad guy : See? Even your most powerful attack can't touch me   *Heartbeat sound effect*   Bad guy : Naniii? When did you acquire such power? Aaaaah I'm beaten   *MC : goes off to beat the next bad guy who also think he's unkillable*  Seriously, it gets old fast. Are there any manga/anime where the bad guys actually aren't overconfident? Where they realize the threat that the MC pose, that they are fighting for their life, that they should be cautious, try everything to win instead of underestimating the MC and ending up paying the price?   I don't mind if a few baddies are dumb, but for most battle shonen the majority of baddies fall under this trope.   Any counter examples?",anime,1hc394d

"About guys rejecting girls in Anime Recently I've been watching a lot of Anime either romance or with no romance but that still have a confession scene.  Most of the times the girl confess and gets rejected, what bothers me the most about it is how they make the girl entitled to the man feeling and often it ends up with the girl crying (which is understandable if she really liked the guy) but the friends who often accompany the girl starts to insult and hate on the guy for rejecting her as if being not interested romantically in her is wrong and he have no right to reject her and he's considered insensitive for rejecting her simply because he doesn't like her, acting as if his emotions are entitled to that girl in specific and he must accept her feelings, when he doesn't he immediately gets portrayed the bad guy because he didn't like her back.   It feels like Anime where they make the girl regret not accepting the other guy feelings for her and make her come back because she realized she was wrong when she shouldn't feel regret for not accepting the feelings of someone she wasn't interested with, she can feel bad but regret it and then go back to him to accept his feelings feel like she was pressured by the guilt trip to accept his feelings.  It just feels weird and I've seen that ""guy is the asshole for rejecting the girl"" a lot either as a side plot or the main focus and never a ""Oh, I understand, you are a person with feelings after all and I shouldn't make you the villain just because you are a person with emotions"" as if the girl the guy is rejecting to is expected to say yes and when he doesn't he's the asshole and insensitive.  I just hate how regardless of gender the person who is receiving a confession is always the bad guy for rejecting it. I already read explanations about why girls are made to regret rejecting someone in Anime when they shouldn't regret it so now I'm curious to know why this is what happens to guys when rejecting someone.  What exactly caused this/what's the reason behind this decision because I genuinely can't understand it.  (Forgot to specify the anime I'm watching are old Anime I watched or just scenes I remembered but I don't remember what Anime is it, I did say I was watching them recently and it is true but those scenes are really short and do nothing for the show, they are just there because yes.

"Any romance Anime or Manga that has both the leads be outgoing and ""attractive""? Recently I think I got a bit of a bore from romance because I feel like most of which I've seen have one lead be the ""outgoing"" one and the other be the more ""shy"" one, or one being talkative and the other not.  Which I get, it is a fun source of dynamics or such, I ain't complaining but I think I read too much of the same thing.  So I think I want something that involves the two or more leads having distinct and active personalities, or the two having an attractive factor that makes me look at both of them like ""damn you're hot"", not in a ""cool"" way like some protagonists but more in a ""they're pretty fun"" way, like with both characters having captivating personalities.

Hype-AF anime like DBZ/Naruto with emotional moments and hype fight scenes... But for girls. I don't know if there's a specific name for this genre but I want some girl-centric hype anime to watch with my daughter (10 yrs). We've watched the entirety of Dragonball and are moving onto DBZ which she's also loving.  However I know DBZ is just men punching each other for 250~ episodes and wouldn't be surprised if she gets bored at some point. So it would be nice to have something else to watch in the interim and something more catered to her tastes as a girl than just watching what I loved as a kid.  Bonus points if you include which version to watch if there is a particularly good/bad sub/dub etc.   Re-watching DBZ with the funimation dub (with japanese music) has really shown me how amateur the Ocean dub was that I saw a kid especially with all the cut content I've never seen.,anime,1d0g6d4

I kinda love them but i am out of suggestions so far. Darker than Black or Berserk (the manga :D ) are great examples of what i am looking for. I love the serious element on the series. i love Bleach for example but i want less colors and comic-relief scenes.      Thank you guys, have a nice weekend ahead.     P.S I am not depressed :D",anime,1cuwex8
"Is Berserk 1997 worth a watch? I've heard about how good Berserk is (specially the manga, but Im not a manga reader) só inwas always curious about. I've been wanting/hoping for the last few years that they would announce a new proper anime adaptation but it doesn't look like that Will happen any time Soon (if at all). I've heard that Berserk 1997 focus more on the second manga arc, will i be able to understand whats going on by watching the anime? Anything i should watch before/after to better the experience? Thanks to everyone that read this.",anime,1cm0oru
"An anime that you think looks nice Im not sure how to describe this, i just want an anime that looks good, the genre and contents doesnt matter.  some examples of animes that in my mind look nice:   samurai champloo,   frieren,   the ranking of kings,   afro samurai,   the elusive samurai,   jobless reincarnation,   anything miyazaki,   anything trigger,   anything adapted from fujimoto,  some examples of animes that in my mind dont look nice:   log horizon,   charlotte,   overlord,   sao,   dr. stone,   attack on titan,  if you like any of the shows in the second list i mean no offence, this is entirely vibes based. please just comment the animes that you yourself found particularly visualy pleasing",anime,1hqsbnh

Are there any similar ones to these:  * Saiki K, * Grand Blue Dreaming * Oresuki * Konosuba * Cautious Hero * Eminence in Shadow * Love Flops * No Game No Life * Kaguya-sama * Teasing Master Takagi-san * Tomo-chan is a Girl * Saga of Tanya the Evil (Not technically a comedy, but Being X terrorizing Tanya, and the dumb decisions of some countries made me laugh more than it should've)  Edit: After reading through all of your comments, watching a few episodes of the shows, and careful consideration, I decided to rewatch Grand Blue Dreaming, thank you for your help.",anime,1hl3fh2
"Anime where you discover hidden truths, like Attack on Titan, Shadow House, and Promised Neverlands Anime where you discover hidden truths, like Attack on Titan, Shadow House, and Promise Neverland?  I've been looking for more animes like that  Made in Abyss is on my watch list.  I'd prefer a dub, I heard of shinseki yori (from a new world) but i can only find it subtitles.  I read Tokyo ghoul somewhere, and I watched it but it didn't fit the bill of finding a dark hidden secret for me...  And I watched wonder egg, but it didn't really hit me with the dark secrets to uncover like the 3 mentioned in the title had...I can't think of the right word, but the best I can come up with is their was a more mysterious flow to the other shows, where they were just discovering twist after twist until we found the real reason for their existence and what's going on  Any other recommendations?",anime,1h650h1

I don't really care about the genre, it just need to have really good world building and story. And one more thing, the anime should not be 100+ episodes.

The teens and tweens (11-16 mostly) love it, but I don't know very much about anime at all! What are some shows (on Crunchyroll please) that are appropriate for this age range? They tend to like magic and wholesomeness in a school setting. So far they've watched some of Haikyu!!! and a couple episodes about some human who goes to demon school or something like that.  Also, are there any Christmas/winter holiday animes (and what is the plural of anime)? I'm trying to plan our December club meeting and would love to show something like that!

"Anime like Ranma 1/2? I’ve seen some people ask this, but most of the answers I’ve seen I feel are either really dated, or don’t have the same balance of action, comedy, and romance that Ranma does. I was wondering if anyone could recommend a story similar to Ranma, that was released somewhat recently, and animated closer to the 2024 reboot than the original.   Some common recs were  Inuyasha, which I think takes a while for the romance  Urusei Yatsura, where I think the main character is really hard to watch. However, I do like how the plot introduces the romance pretty quickly kind of like Ranma 1/2 does!  Kenichi the mightiest disciple, which is kind of old and Kenichi is also kind of tough to watch  Could anyone please recommend anything like Ranma that has the same balance of comedy and romance with some action mixed in?

"Looking for Anime Recommendations with Stronger Female Leads I'm currently watching *My Hero Academia* Season 3, and I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed. While I get that the male characters are powerful, it feels like a real disservice that the female characters' abilities are so underplayed.  Characters like Ochako, Momo, Froppy, Itsuka, and Jiro have incredible abilities and sharp strategic minds, but they're severely underutilized. The way these characters are written, with more emphasis on their appearances and assets or stereotypical roles, is very very frustrating, especially when we know their potential. In a show that celebrates heroes and individuality, it is disappointing to see the imbalance in how both male and female characters are portrayed.  Needless to say, I was purely disheartening to notice gender bias in such a popular anime—though maybe I’m wrong. Can anyone recommend anime where female characters are just as badass, or at the very least where all characters, regardless of gender, get fair representation and screen time? Is that too much to ask?",anime,1fwflxx

"Looking for an anime that does a good job balancing drama with comedy? It seems like a lot of animes I watch lean really heavily on one side or the other. They're either completely comedy and hard to take seriously (Konosuba as an example), or they're completely serious and there's hardly any lighthearted moments (like Steins;Gate).  Don't get me wrong, I love both shows and genres but I prefer stuff that's somewhere in between. I'm thinking of shows like Re:Zero and Darling in the Franxx. Both are undoubtedly serious shows, with a fair amount of drama, but they have some almost juevenile humor and lighthearted moments sprinkled in that help lighten the mood. I love this kinda stuff, so recommend me some other animes to watch that balance this line between drama and comedy... thanks!",anime,1ezka5a

"Anime where the characters act more adult like? Idk if just cuz I have gotten older or what, but shows where the mc's are literal kids (HxH) just seem so odd to me. I have tried to get into HxH but I can't and i am like 40 eps in.   Even tho Yuji is like mid teens or something, he is drawn and acts like an immature 20ish year old and obviously Gojo is a dumbass but he and Geto and nanami are all adults.   Other anime I like is Stein's Gate, Psycho Pass, Death Note, Hajime no Ippo, AOT, Code Geass, Cowboy Bebop.   I don't know if its just hte animation, but even if the people in these shows are mid teens, the theme of the show or the way they act makes them seem like adults dealing with adult type topics. All of these characters also have a pretty realistic adult view of life. Can someone recc some good anime that is kind of like that.   Fav character in anime is def Gojo, Spike and Guts. Cocky and nonchalent but strong, or just plain fucking strong for guts. Thanks guys",anime,1ehvcqq

"A genuine underdog protagonist. I really hate when manga/anime are advertised as having some kind of underpowered protagonist, and everyone treats them as one, only for them to actually be OP, and have the rest of the manga be nothing but power fantasy ""i told you so"" moments.  I want a protagonist who is genuinely outmatched in most situations, and has to use all of their wits, skill, and assets at their disposal to come out on top. The anime doesnt necessarily have to be all action though. I like character focused fantasy stories. I want a protagonist who actually loses sometimes, and reacts to situations like an actual person would.  Some examples I like:  * JJBA - an obvious example * Megalo Box - while different from the typical action anime, it has exactly what i am looking for in terms of fights * Konosuba - while not an action anime at all, the way all of the characters gimmics work makes for quite fun fights, imo",anime,1e1066a

"Any anime similar to mushishi? Basically I recommended mushishi to my girlfriend and she loved it but to my surprise she said she loves this genre of anime.  What exactly she means by this genre I’m not sure but I’m looking for an anime that I haven’t watched yet as well so that we can enjoy the next one together.  I assume what she means is mystery solving. Either that, or perhaps not even the solving part but exploration of a mysterious world. Mushishi is very pleasing visually so that probably played a factor also.   I actually never watch this type of anime so I’m stumped when it comes to thinking of what might be similar. If I may add a personal request, if you could refrain from anime’s that I would label as “mindfuck anime” that would be very much appreciated, to me those anime usually just come off as a pretentious jumble of nonsense.   At first I thought of Ghost in the Shell because it’s similar in how each episode they solve a different mystery, but I showed a bit to her before and she wasn’t too interested. I think it’s all the robots and also the inclination to have politics in an anime that made it less appealing. Something more chill and full of mystery/exploration would probably hit the right spot.   Much appreciated!!!",anime,1gg2vmi

"Be proud of your favorite shows and don’t let anyone make you feel ashamed. Never be ashamed of having mainstream shows in your top 10/5/whatever. You know what?

I’ve been watching anime for 14+ years (I’m 22 now) and that doesn’t make me any better. I have seen a shit ton of shows and Naruto and Inuyasha is in my top 10. That show hits different and doesn’t automatically make me less than anyone else. It doesn’t make me better than anyone else because I had internet access at 8 years old and was surrounded by older people who watched anime.   If one of your favorite shows is only for “beginners”, that’s okay. Be proud of what you like.

"I made a list of Anime everyone should watch. Each with a short description and sorted by genre. *I will keep this updated as I continue to watch more anime*  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Bold items are HIGHLY recommended, they're my personal favorites. Italics are good starter anime.  Adult/Mature:  * **Berserk (1997)**: Lone swordsman badass battles his way through life. Shakespeare-ish storyline.  * **Monster**: Cat and mouse thriller/drama. Anti-Christ themes. Psychopath killer.  * **Cowboy Bebop**: Space western. A group of bounty hunters just trying to get by. AMAZING artwork and music. Watching the dubbed version is a MUST.  * Neon Genesis Evangelion: Action mecha. Don't want to spoil too much here. Depression themed. Very famous anime. Watching the movie, ""The End of Evangelion"" is a MUST after you complete the show.  * Steins;Gate: Time traveling done right. Thriller. Starts off light hearted, turns dark. The dub is pretty good.  * Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Magical Girl genre that went to hell.  * Made in Abyss: Uneasy feels throughout. A deep abyss in the middle of a city that people explore.  * *Samurai Champloo*: Nujabes soundtrack! ""Cowboy Bebop"" vibes. A story of three strangers who come together on a journey across Japan. Dub is preferable.   * Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Space opera. If Star Wars was more political and an anime. Democracy vs. monarchy. Extremely dialogue heavy.   * *Vinland Saga*: Takes place in the early 11th century towards the end of the Viking Age. Deals with the realities of war, slavery, and political chaos that defined Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Incredible background stills. Great voice acting.   * Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor: Life or death gambling games that rich people use to entertain themselves. The main character tries to outsmart them, erase his dept, and stay alive.  Peaceful/Relaxing:  * **Mushishi**: Wandering doctor cures people from 'diseases' caused by entities that very few can see. Not easy to binge. Episodic and relaxing.   * **March Comes in Like a Lion**: A young shogi prodigy, who lives alone, struggles with life as a professional. A family 'adopts' him to help him out of his reclusive shell. Lots of feels.  * K-on: Not a big fan of the cute girls doing cute things genre, but this show just makes you feel happy. Wholesome. Girls in a music club. Watch ""Non Non Biyori"" if you're a fan of this style of anime.  * *Spice & Wolf*: Romance between a wolf girl and a traveling salesman. The story is based around Medieval economics. Dub is preferable.  * A Place Further Than The Universe: A story of a girl who wants to experience life to the fullest. With the help of a friend, she's inspired to travel with her to Antarctica. As a viewer, it inspired me to travel as well.  * *Space Brothers*: After witnessing a UFO one night, two young brothers vow to go to space. In adulthood, the younger brother is on his way to becoming the first Japanese man on the moon while the older brother is struggling with reality. The story involves the older brother's effort to catch up with his younger brother, and to fulfill the promise they made together when they were young. Character driven plot. Lots of comedy. Heartwarming. VERY realistic. Attention to detail.  Sports:  * **Ping Pong the Animation**: Unique art style and amazing music. Mindsets involved with 1v1 competition. Deeper themes that don't revolve around the sport of Ping Pong.   * **Haikyuu**: Volleyball. A kid who can jump high joins his high school team. I got goosebumps during the action scenes. Great animation during the matches. Realistic. In my opinion, the PEAK of shounen sports anime as a genre. Guilty pleasure.  * Kuroko's Basketball: Not realistic. The incarnation of anime basketball. All the players have unique traits.  * Slam Dunk: My favorite main character. From the same mangaka who created ""Vagabond"". Goofy MC, who's a great athlete, learns basketball. Mostly a comedy. The manga is top-tier and my preferred version.   * Initial D: Classic. Japanese street/mountain racing. 10/10 music.  * Welcome to the Ballroom: A student learns ballroom dancing. Very interesting, and I learned a lot about competitive dancing as well. This show fixed my posture.   * One Outs: ""Death Note"" baseball. Gambling themed. An amazing pitcher who is a gambling addict. Lots of mind games.  * Run With The Wind: Long distance running. A troubled teen is recruited to join a newly formed running club. Comfy college setting. Seinen. Great cast of characters and atmosphere.  * *Hajime no Ippo*: A hardworking student picks up the sport of boxing. With a lot of natural talent, hard work, and mentorship, he fights his way towards the top. Lots of funny moments.   Shounen Adventure:  * **One Piece**: Classic. An eccentric kid wants to become king of the pirates and find One Piece, the greatest treasure in the world. Incredible main cast. The author constantly builds upon the plot despite its length. 100s of episodes.  * **Hunter x Hunter**: An outdoorsy kid wants to become a hunter and search for his dad, who left him at birth to become a hunter. Not traditional hunters, they're more like awesome fighters with societal benefits. The show, to me, was beyond expectations.  * *Naruto*: Classic. A troublesome kid wants to become the best ninja in his village. Excellent characters. Lots of lore related to the world. Iconic power system. 100s of episodes. ""Naruto: Shippuden"" is it's sequel. 100s of episodes as well. I recommend skipping the fillers for both.  * *Dragonball/Dragonball Z*: Classics. The main character is on a quest to find all 7 dragon balls! Both Dragonball and Dragonball Z can be watched separately. Some prefer one over the other. Dragonball has more traditional martial arts and silly gags while DBZ is more masculine and supernatural. The original Dragonball manga built the foundation for modern shounen. 100s of episodes. Dub is preferable.  * Yu Yu Hakusho: From the creator of ""Hunter x Hunter"". At one point, it had higher ratings in Japan compared to DBZ during its airtime. Hard to describe. A badass student fights his way through life with his fists. Supernatural setting. Great villains. The best OP to ever exist. Dub is preferable.  * *Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood*: Classic. Two brothers, who are prodigies at using magic (alchemy), fail miserably in reviving their mother. Consequently, they lose most of their bodies. The story is a journey of getting their bodies back. Dub is preferable.  * *My Hero Academia*: A boy born without superpowers, in a world where they have become commonplace, dreams of becoming a hero himself. A future classic.  * *Demon Slayer*: After his family is murdered by demons, a young man finds that his younger sister is the sole survivor and has turned into a demon herself. Vowing vengeance, while bringing his sister along, he learns swordsmanship in an effort to defeat demons and turn his sister back into a human. Incredible production value, with a cool aesthetic to boot.  * *Jujutsu Kaisen*: A student bears the task of housing the most dangerous demon of all time in his body. With this hindrance, he fights to save as many people as he can from monsters known as curses. Darker than most shounen. Fast-paced. Lots of action. Likable MC.    Comedy:  * **Gintama**: Aliens have taken over Japan and outlawed samurais. With our main character out of work, he'll take any job at this point. One of the few shows, in any media, to make me laugh out loud. It's mostly episodic, but it has a few arcs that rival anything else in the medium. Hilarious cast of characters and lots of references to other anime. Excellent chemistry between the voice actors. 100s of episodes.  * *One Punch Man*: A self described 'hero for fun' is bored of how strong he is. Parody of superhero shows. Self explanatory.    * The Disastrous Life of Saiki K: Parody. A kid who has overpowering psychic powers is burdened by his overpowering psychic powers. Each episode is made up of roughly four 5 minute scenes. Dub is pretty good.   * Nichijou: A day in the life of your not-so-average school girls. AMAZING animation. Slapstick gags and skits. Each episode is made up of roughly four 5 minute scenes. Guilty pleasure.  * Daily Lives of High School Boys: Relatable sketches. Slightly raunchy. Playing off the all-too-common “schoolgirls and everyday life” genre. The meta humor it features is a real high point. Each episode is made up of roughly four 5 minute scenes.  * *Spy x Family*: Father is a spy, mother is an assassin, and the daughter can read minds. Super cute, super wholesome, super funny. My pick for the anime of 2022.  Over-the-top Fun:  * *Gurren Lagenn*: Many consider it a modern classic. Full of spirit. Epic battle scenes and storyline. An outstanding mecha.  * **Kill la Kill**: Action action action, *some* fan service, and comedy. ""Gurren Lagenn"" vibes. I got hype watching this. Unique art style.  Excellent animation, OP/ED's, and OST.  * Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Classic. Hard to describe. But it has amazing art and OP/ED's. Covered in American influence. Us vs. them themed. After watching, you'll understand SO many meme/anime references.  Movies:  * *Essentially every Studio Ghibli film*: My favorites are: Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. The Dubs are all HIGHLY recommended.   * **Perfect Blue**: Rated R+. The lead member of a J-pop idol group tries to make it solo as an actress. Deals with the realities of ""Hollywood"". Very relevant despite its age. Excellent directing.  * The Garden of Words: From the director of ""5 Centimeters Per Second"". Romance. Visually it's an 11/10 and for that reason alone, I recommend it.   * Ghost in the Shell (1995): Cyberpunk sci-fi thriller. Incredible visuals. Cyborg cops battle an anonymous super-hacker who takes control of people's computerized brains and forces them to do his bidding. What makes us human?  * *A Silent Voice*: Looks at teen bullying from a soberingly hard-hitting perspective that's uncommon for the animated medium. Lots of feels.  * *Your Name*: Slife-of-life/rom-com between two students who swap bodies. Lots of feels.  Misc.:  * **Bakuman**: From the creators of ""Death Note"". Two students try to make it as manga artists. One outlines the story, and the other draws. Their goal is to get an anime adaption. I learned SO much about the anime/manga industry. Some romance sprinkled in. Wholesome. Criminally underappreciated.  * Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!: Similar to ""Bakuman"", but it's a story of three friends making an anime together. With the main character's focus being image boards and concept designs. Unique art style, and incredible scenery with a keen attention to detail. You can feel the warmth that was put into this show. This anime is a love letter to anime.  * Mob Psycho 100: From the man who made ""One Punch Man"". The art is more consistent with ONE's source material compared to Murata's OPM adaption. More of a storyline compared to OPM. Many consider it better. A shy kid with overpowered psychic abilities tries to live a normal life.  * *Attack on Titan*: Classic. Humans are trapped within walls. Outside the walls are huge titans that want to eat them. Where did the titans come from? How did the humans end up in this situation? Find out on the next episode of Attack on Titan.  * *Death Note*: Classic. Cat and mouse thriller. A smart student finds a book. Any name written in the book kills the individual. God complex.  * *Trigun*: Cyberpunk western. A very likable main character with a mysterious past. Shounen turned seinen. Dub is preferable.",anime,cou8pi
"I've seen over 500 anime, here's what I consider to be must-watches Making this mainly because it would've been really helpful when I started out. I've been watching since I was 16, so just under 10 years of pretty consistently watching anime. This won't include every good anime I've seen, and I definitely haven't seen every good anime. And not all of these are shows that I've liked, but still believe are worth watching or trying at the least. I've broken up this list into 3 categories:  1. What I believe to be must-watches for anyone remotely interesting in anime, whether it's quality or because it's a core part of the medium. 2. What I believe are must-tries, whether it's too long or may not be for everyone, it still has to be tried even if you end up putting it down. 3. What I recommend, but not everyone might like.  |Must Watches| |:-| |Monster - A classic adaptation of a story from one of the best manga writers Naoki Urasawa| |Neon Genesis Evangelion - Definitely not for everyone, but still an essential watch for it's influence and existentialist themes| |Full Metal Alchemist:Brotherhood - While the earlier FMA is underrated, FMA:B is a near-perfect classic| |Ping Pong the Animation - Probably the best ""sports"" anime, regardless of its initially offputting animation style| |Cowboy Bebop - If you hadn't seen this show already, you've definitely heard about it. Just as good as everyone says it is, while not every episode is masterpiece status - there are a good handful of episodes that make the whole show worth the watch.| |The Tatami Galaxy - Especially recommended if you're in college, a great show about how you should make the most of the life you've got.| |Ghost in the Shell:Stand Alone Complex - Including the movie, this show is a classic that delves into psychological and existential themes as it gauges what makes someone human.| |Mob Psycho - What I believe to be the latest ""classic"" show, a great show backed by a well developed cast of characters, fantastic animations, and a crazy storyline you'd only find in anime.| |FLCL - Wonky short series that everyone should watch, if for nothing else than just the industry elite who worked on this| |Serial Experiments Lain - A look at how the digital era has influenced our lives, relevant today despite being made 25 years ago.| |Code Geass - While some episodes have aged poorly, and the show isn't consistently a 10/10, the final episode alone makes it worth the watch.| |Baccano! - The cast of characters, solid animation, and cohesive story despite taking on multiple points of views makes this a must watch in my opinion.| |Gurren Lagann - The antithesis of Evangelion, and a show that should be recommended to anyone who has suffered from depression.| |Steins;Gate - Surprisingly not as recommended as it was when I first started watching anime, Steins;Gate is a show that actually does time travel right. The characters are endearing and the main character's development makes this show a classic.| |Nichijou - I don't like a ton of comedy anime, but Nichijou is charming while having extremely out of pocket humor from nowhere.| |HunterxHunter (2011) - One of the best shounen ever, with a well-done power system and several arcs that on their own are better than most shows together.| |Psycho-Pass (Season 1) - While following seasons aren't terrible, Psycho-Pass season 1 is a show I'd recommend to people who aren't even fans of anime.| |Attack on Titan - Doubt a lot of people haven't seen, or at least tried, this show - but had to be included regardless.| |Death Parade - Fairly short show at 12 episodes, and a shoe-in for any list of ""underrated anime you need to watch""| |One Punch Man (Season 1) - Story is silly and has no stakes, main character has no development, but the animation alone makes this worth a watch. Season 2, not so much.| |Pluto - Also an adaptation from Naoki Urasawa, Pluto is another examination at what makes someone human.| |Devilman: Crybaby - Just about very show by Masaaki Yuasa is worth a watch, and this adaptation of the classic manga was really popular when it came out - but not something I see too many people talk about anymore.| |Vinland Saga - Unfinished, but assuming it keeps up the same quality and from what I've heard from the manga readers, this will probably be joining the classics when it finishes.| |Jujutsu Kaisen - Overrated? Maybe. Talked about to death. Definitely. A Must Watch? Absolutely| |Samurai Champloo - Not too dissimilar to Cowboy Bebop, just in setting. Still a classic.| |Welcome to the NHK! - A must watch for people who watch anime, a healthy reminder to avoid being a shut-in and how important it is to socialize.| |Death Note - Upon rewatch, a lot of this comes across as cringy and over-the-top. Still a must watch, even if it isn't perfect and if the final third of the show is nowhere close to as good as the rest of it.| |Fate/Zero - Probably the best battle royale show, and definitely the best of the Fate series. Ufotable at their best.| |Made in Abyss - Also unfinished, also will probably be a classic when (if) it does finish.| |Re:Zero - Unfinished as well, but what I believe to be the best isekai.| |Frieren - After a solid first season, this is an extremely good show with a lot of detail into the worldbuilding and character development.| |Madoka Magica - Similar to Death Note, I don't think this is one of the best shows ever, but I think what it did for the ""cute girls doing cute things"" genre warrants it a spot, and the show itself is very good even if I think Shaft has done better since.|  |Must Try| |:-| |Legend of the Galactic Heroes - I think this is one of the best shows ever, but it is extremely long and takes a while to get into. I think it's worth a try, but may not be for everyone.| |3-Gatsu no Lion - Season 1 of this series splits its focus between explaining Shogi and the main character. It's far stronger when focusing on the latter, and the characters the MC plays against. Season 2 is one of the best seasons of any show I've seen because of it.| |Berserk (90s) - Pretty choppy animation, but the story itself shows why Golden Age has been adapted like 3 times.| |Monogatari Series - Probably Shaft's best work, and one of the prettiest shows out there. It's a non-stop yap-sesh as Araragi battles monsters that form from high school girl's emotions, and is definitely worth trying. Only not a must-watch because it has a lot of episodes, and sometimes the dialogue is too much.| |JoJo's Bizarre Adventures - A show with one amazing season after another, each featuring a new cast of characters. Only downside is that first season.| |Paranoia Agent - Satoshi Kon's only anime series (I believe), a surreal crime thriller that demonstrates why Kon was one of the best the medium had to offer.| |Hajime no Ippo - Extremely stereotypical zero to hero show, but man some of the fights make the slow start worth it.| |Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu - A great show that animates one of Japan's ways of storytelling, and along with it comes some great stories.| |Mushishi - A very slow episodic series where each episode is a new person suffering from yokai or some illness. Pretty tough to get through if you watch each season after another like I did, but still a good enough show to recommend to anyone.| |Hellsing Ultimate - Only show like it, each episode gets crazier than the last. But I don't think it's good enough to qualify being a must-watch.| |Soul Eater - Great shounen with a very unique style, but that last arc was a pretty big letdown.| |Spice and Wolf - A slow burn romance between a man and a wolf that spends 90% of the runtime explaining economics. I think it's an endearing show, but not necessarily a masterpiece.| |Durarara!! - Same people who did Baccano, just not as cohesive or consistently great. Similar storytelling method, taking on multiple point of views, and a wider cast of characters that makes it worth trying nonetheless.| |Kill la Kill - Another one of those ""this can only be done in anime"" type shows, which can be a fun show if you turn your brain off and can get past looking at high school girls in skimpy outfits.| |Black Lagoon - Not my favorite show, but in the same vein as Cowboy Bebop where each episode is a a new scenario tackling a new theme.| |One Piece - Couldn't get into it, but also not a show I can pretend doesn't exist.|  |Shows I recommend, others may not like| |:-| |Dead Dead Demons Dededede Destruction - A great adaptation of Inion Asano's latest manga, examining a group of young adults entering into the adult world while a UFO is collapsing above them. | |Run with the Wind - One of the best sports anime, definitely recommend if you've done sports or any type of team activities in your life.| |Parasyte - A really well done ""zero-to-hero"" story, with a backdrop of world-ending aliens invading humanity.| |Mononoke - Not to be confused with Princess Mononoke, this is a visually stunning show anyone who likes anime should try out.| |Kaiba - Another Yuasa show, who rarely misses. A great space odyssey that'll have some episodes stay with you years after.| |Toradora! - Pretty typical romance anime, but this one stuck with me for whatever reason.| |Usagi Drop - Heartwarming slice of life story of a father and daughter, just don't read or look into the manga.| |Hibike Euphonium - Besides the music and animation, which are great, the story itself can draw a lot of parallels if you were ever in a band, or even sports.| |Violet Evergarden - I don't like this as much as some people, but it's worth a recommendation nonetheless. I wish more anime tried to distinguish itself like this one.| |Hyouka - Another high school show that's surprisingly good, solving mysteries with a developing romance as the backdrop.| |Sakamichi no Apollon - Great coming of age while in a band story, has one of the catchiest OPs.| |Space Dandy - If Cowboy Bebop didn't take itself seriously, some of these episodes are fantastic. | |Fate/stay night: UBW - Not quite as good as Zero, but definitely still worth a watch.| |Ergo Proxy - Another 00's show that examines humanity through the relationships between humanity and robots. Great show if you're looking for a more serious anime.| |Megalo Box - Personally my favorite from the boxing animes, the second season examines the fallout from sacrificing everything and it all the better for it.| |Grand Blue - Another rare anime I found actually funny, looking forward to the second season soon.|",anime,1jpvgb5
Is code geass worth watching? I’ve seen the characters and kinda like em’  Wanna know if it’s worth watching,anime,jfak5h
"Your lie in April is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen Let me preface by saying I have never bawled my eyes out watching anything in my life before this. However, this show just made my heart tick. I can’t even explain in words how it made feel, from the music, the characters, the plot. It draws you into their world, you can’t help but love each and every character there.  I would need over a thousand words to justify what I just went through watching this, it’s an emotional roller coaster that had me in tears throughout.  For a small detail of the plot without spoilers, it follows an ex-pianist prodigy finding his foothold in life alongside another classical musician making their presence known to all. Be warned however, the ending is absolutely heart-wrenching and had me watching through tears.  Do yourself a favour, give it a watch, you’ll be delighted with what you receive.  10/10    Apparently I need another 600 characters in order to post this, so I’ll list my takeaways from this show. It makes me wish I knew how to play the piano. The sounds that come out of that and the technical skill is amazing. Classical music has taken my fancy for once. I’m not the type to enjoy classical, however I found myself falling to sleep with it in my ears, and it feels as though it is painting a picture with each chord played. Also it’s funny as you are listening through trying to figure out if the pianist in the scene is actually doing an insanely good job, or is grating to the ears because as someone who is not experienced with this type of music it is quite amusing the reactions the characters give when I think the exact opposite.  If anyone has any similar anime as well please let me know in the comments, I’d love to watch more from a similar genre if there is any.  じゃあ！",anime,ki7571
"After years of always wanting it, I have a projector set up at 100 inches screen size, a 4TB external hdd to store anime, oh and a gf too who wants to see ""whats so good about that stuff you watch"" As such, I'm accepting any and all reccomendations!  &#x200B;  Edit: Fuck me these are a lot of comments lol, thank you everyone I will read everything.",anime,hu93rk
"An anime that won't let you sleep when you start it I need an anime that is so good that i don't want to sleep and instead watch the anime completely in the night.  Best example and my fav anime: Attack on Titan  More good examples: Death Note, Demon Slayer, The Seven Deadly Sins, Code Geass, Jujutsu Kaisen, HxH  Pls upvote so more people can suggest anime here so that we can gather an huge amount of anime here ✌🏻  Thanks to everyone that suggest something here! 👍🏻",anime,mjgjvp
"The Disastrous Life of Saiki K is PHENOMENAL God-tier comedy anime. Hilarious, fast-paced, and witty are understatements to describe this. The pacing is so good that you won't have time to spare to get bored-- it doesn't really have an encompassing plot but I suggest to watch each episode chronologically because there are always new characters added, and you'll have to follow how Saiki tries to hide his powers. The humor varies from slapstick to deadpan, sarcastic, situational, and it never ever gets tiring despite the unique structure. The occasional absurdity never gets old and I can say it's really well-written.    The characters are their each kind of funny, comical, and embodies the exaggerated version of cliche that makes it hilarious. At first the MC may seem cold and lifeless but it gets heart-warming along the way, with how he deals with situations and with the people around him. The MC gets to spend time with each character that really shows his relationships which makes it more interesting.    This is my happy pill anime tbh and one of my few 10s. If you wanna really laugh out loud and feel good, I highly recommend this!",anime,grk5tc
"Should I watch Kaguya-Sama: love is war? I enjoy comedy, romance and slice of life animes,(lots of other genres too, but I think Kaguya-sama is this one) but only watched the first episode of Kaguya-sama. I hear a lot of good things about the anime and a lot of memes from it, but I'm starting a new job and won't have a whole lot of free time to watch 6+ episodes before making a firm judgement (usually what I did)   I'd rather not spend time trying to find new shows when I have others releasing I already enjoy. But part of me feels like I should watch kaguya-sama, so I'm here to ask if it's worth the watch!   Thanks in advance for your help",anime,h96d6r
"To everyone who convinced me to watching Haikyuu despite me finding the sport itself boring: thank you! To everyone who’s dubious about watching Haikyuu whether or not you know about volleyball: PLEASE WATCH IT! I made a post 5 days ago asking if it was worth the watch even though I find watching volleyball tournaments irl boring. I’ve been on my 3rd day of binge-watching, and I am **ABSOLUTELY** loving it. Watching Haikyuu definitely gave me much respect to the sport itself, and I don’t think I could ever watch one irl without ever appreciating it. I can’t get enough of Haikyuu, I think I’m gonna rewatch right after S4 or read the manga itself. Thank you so much! If you could suggest other sports anime with the same vibe as Haikyuu, I would gladly appreciate it!",anime,gv6w4j
"Your top 3 anime. Tell me your top 3 , I need to decide what to watch next.  My current top 3 are code geass , gintama , and Aot.",anime,ifvw2j
"I recently caught up to Gintama, and I think you should make it your 2021 goal to at least start it. Here's why I think that. I know we've all seen Gintama floating around on the internet so often. People saying ""watch Gintama!"" and posting funny clips of the show all over reddit. I want to take a slightly different approach as to why I loved the show so much. Most of the time you hear, ""it's really funny! best comedy!"" with the additional ""the serious moments are so good!"" but I want to share my thoughts on why both aspects of it are so good, and why they work so well together. This post will not contain any major or specific spoilers.  So to start things off, **how is the comedy in Gintama**? I will warn you ahead of time, Gintama is not afraid to be vulgar. If you're turned off by jokes about private parts and poop, it's not the central focus of the humor but there is a lot of inappropriate humor. There is also a ton of pop culture references, by which I mean one episode may reference about 20 different things. Sometimes there will be entire mini-arcs (3 episodes) dedicated to one parody, something like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or Dragon Quest. There is also a ton of meta humor. They are not afraid to break the fourth wall, talk about the production of the show, voice actors, filler episodes, etc.  **Do you need to understand all the references to enjoy it?** I would say it certainly helps if you have a somewhat strong grasp on Japanese culture, popular game and anime franchises, etc, but it's not *mandatory*. I've seen people go back and forth on this point, and while having a comprehensive knowledge of everything in Japanese media and growing up in Japan will definitely help the enjoyment, I found that with my limited knowledge it was still very fun. Even if I didn't get a reference it was still a silly moment for me, regardless if I knew who they were talking about or not. Plus, if you really want to, you can look up the references later to have an ""a ha!"" moment and learn more about the pop culture scene.  **All of the characters are unique and enjoyable!** Everyone has their own personality and their own dynamic with each other. You have the lazy yet (usually) dependable Gintoki, the straight man Shinpachi who's the butt of a lot of jokes, the vulgar overconfident Kagura, the leader of the rebels who is serious to a fault even in ridiculous situations Katsura, I could go on and on. Every character has their own vibe, their own appeal, their own dynamic with other characters, and their own running gags. Every time you see one of them on screen you know what to expect and it always delivers in a satisfying way, to the point where sometimes you'll see two characters interact and you're like, ""oh man how will they interact?"" It's really fun!  **So, comedy aside, what is the plot of the show?** The show takes place in Edo, specifically Kabukichō which is an entertainment and red-light district of Shinjuku in real Japan. There are host and hostess clubs, shops, nightclubs, restaurants, casinos, you name it. Aliens known as Amanto attacked Japan and took over, starting the sword ban. Samurai are far and few between and those who remain get by however they can. Enter the main character, Gintoki. A samurai who fought in the war against the invading Amanto, he still carries a wooden sword around and runs a business called Odd Jobs where he'll take on any task, from finding a kitten to stopping an invasion.  It's a very simple premise but it builds up and pays off in great ways. The more serious aspects of the plot come from leftovers of the war, rebels that defy the current government, the police force (Shinsengumi) trying to keep order, and some darker shadows behind the scenes, the truth of the Amanto, and the teacher that raised Gintoki and a few other of the main characters. It leads to some really serious and oftentimes depressing moments in the series.  **So, how good are the serious portions?** The action portions of the show are a little scarce early on. There's definitely a heavier focus on the comedy. At episode 58 you get your first taste of the true action and plot of the series (yes, I know, that's quite a ways in). From there, there are more mini arcs of about 3-6 episodes each that cover some much more serious topics and push the main plot along and introduce new characters and concepts. There's some really hard hitting backstories for some of the characters as well, often in ways you wouldn't expect. It makes each character feel a bit more real. The choreography, music, and voice acting are all top notch.  **How do the comedy and more serious topics blend?** This is the main point of my post that I want to make, and I thank you for reading this far. The serious moments really let you see the characters in a more serious light (duh), while the comedy segments let you see them in moments of peace. They're allowed to laugh, have fun, do stupid shit, but when shit hits the fan it often feels like they need to power through it to see those peaceful moments again. The show doesn't make a big point of this, but it's definitely the factor that pulled me in. You wanna see our goofy main trio get past this terrifying moment and be able to joke around again. You want to see the side characters persevere and overcome the odds so they can see tomorrow and laugh along with the rest of the cast. You get invested in the characters during the funny moments, so the serious moments have a stronger impact.  The action and serious scenes are also littered with silly moments or one-liners that make the fights or moments feel more natural. Like Gintoki will drop a one-liner or do something dumb during a serious moment and it's like ""yeah that seems about right."" He'll make fun of an opponent's name, complain about getting hurt, yelling at the bad guy for overreacting, make dirty distractions to get away, etc. But it always comes back to a satisfying conclusion. The comedy and the action flow seamlessly. A perfect example would be [this moment]( where he fails to make a serious entrance. There's also [this story]( about a dog who was abandoned by his owner. I feel those are my two favorite examples of blending serious with comedy.  Later in the series, especially the last few arcs, the comedy takes a backseat for a much more serious plot. It really makes the stakes feel high and every character feels like a part of this world. It's super well done and I won't say more than that.  **Have you been convinced to check out Gintama?** It's definitely a long series to get into, but it's absolutely worth it. Try sticking to one episode a day or every few days and you'll always have something to look forward to. Just make sure to **skip the first two episodes** because they were made as a celebration of the manga getting an anime adaptation, and it expects you to know all the characters (and also just isn't that great). Episode 3 is the proper ""episode 1"" of the series and begins with the characters meeting for the first time.  Don't think of it as some colossal hurdle to complete, focus on the journey not the destination. Enjoy your ride through the crazy, hilarious, fun, and heartbreaking world of Gintama and I hope you all end up enjoying it! There's definitely a reason that everyone who's seen it regards it so well and now I can confidently say I do too. I'm really excited for the final movie!  **Edit:** I also want to add that all of Gintama (aside from specials and OVAs) is on Crunchyroll!",anime,kn7hcv
"Please don't sleep on RE:LIFE!!! This is a quick one, people, all of you looking for a romance anime, PLEASE watch RE:LIFE!! I went into it expecting a mediocre romance to pass the time, but saying that it surprised me is an understatement. The character development, mature writing with no cringy moments, overall tone of the show, and the conclusion... This has to be one of the best romance's I've ever watched. It has only 17 episodes (13 first season, and 4 ep special). And it couldn't be more perfect, it wasn't dragged out nor it was too short... I won't spoil anything, but I can confidently say that I don't get easily affected by this kind of media be it movies, anime, games etc... but this one blew me away... Maybe I hyped it up too much, it isn't a 10/10 flawless show, but it's at least in my opinion one of the best romances I've ever watched, it kept me at the edge of my seat last 5 or so episodes. The show focuses on around 7 characters, and the growth of each character is on another level, and it does't feel forced at all. There are no ""sex"" scenes and lewd moments that have somehow become the staple of romance anime. It tackles struggles of adulthood as well as struggles of highschoolers, it manages to blend every aspect of the show perfectly. Plus this show has a very original and interesting premise which is reliving your high school days. The show progressively gets better witch each episode concluding with the last episode which is the best episode. Overall I couldn't recommend this show enough since it's near masterpiece level in my opinion but it doesn't get nearly as much credit as it deserves.  &#x200B;  EDIT: So  due to many recommendations in the comments, I went ahead and speed run-ed last 30 or so chapters of the manga, and that epilogue chapter... man... I'm lost for words, this truly is a masterpiece. So now that I've read it, I still recommend watching anime first, then reading manga to not be annoyed with the stuff the anime cut out... Definitely recommend reading and watching, but manga has a more complete concluision.",anime,nksni1
Anime you consider 10/10 I love anime but I would only give a few of the many shows and movies i've watched a 10/10.  My 10s are -  Perfect Blue  Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul  I have tons of 8s and 9s but to me these are the best of the best. What do you consider 10/10? I've been looking for more anime to give me the same special feeling I got when watching these.,anime,mprdlv

I just finished Bunny Girl Senpai and it's the first Shojo I actually enjoyed. I cried and laughed and I'd really like to experience this type of emotional rollercoaster again cuz it was really nice. I also watched the movie and cried watching it too 😅. So if you know a similar anime plz do share it !,anime,imrevy
"Here's a short list of my go-to anime recommendations. What are yours? # Preface  (Scroll down if you just wanna see the recs)  I've been watching anime on and off for almost a decade now and have only recently started giving anime suggestions on this sub. While doing so, I noticed that I tend to give many of the same recommendations over and over again, so I decided to compile all my favorites in one place. Doing so has two main purposes:  **Goal 1: To share anime that I full heartedly recommend for any anime viewer.**  I've grouped my recommendations into a few vague categories based on general similarities and vibes. This is by no means meant to be an exhaustive list. I've intentionally culled this list to only include my personal top recommendations, which will naturally be a reflection of my individual tastes. There are many shows I still enjoyed that are not listed here, and their omission is not meant to be a slight against your faves.  There also a few categories that are noticeably missing because I don't tend to enjoy them: romances, tear jerkers, isekai, and sci-fi. I also tend to avoid anything with lots of fan service. This doesn't mean there aren't good shows in these categories. In fact, if you have any must watches in these genres that may convince me to give them a shot, please do share. Which brings me to my second goal.  **Goal 2: Getting recommendations from you.**  I'm always on the lookout for new shows to watch, so if reading through this list brings to mind an anime you think I may enjoy, please do share. That being said, I've watched my fair share of anime, so if a popular show is missing from this list, there's a good chance I've already watched it / given it a chance. Hence, I'd prefer slightly less watched shows, but I'll take anything you have to offer.  Now, without further ado, here are my most common recommendations.  # Just gimme some good shounens  * [Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood]( * [Demon Slayer]( * [Hunter x Hunter (2011)]( * [One Punch Man]( * [My Hero Academia](  # Something a little more gritty  * [Attack on Titan]( * [Vinland Saga]( * [Dororo]( * [Zankyou no Terror]( * [Death Parade](  # Bro this shit kinda fucked tho  * [Banana Fish]( * [Devilman: Crybaby]( * [Made in Abyss]( * [Berserk (1997)]( * [The Promised Neverland](  # In this house, we stan good characterization  * [Run with the Wind]( * [Mob Psycho 100]( * [Ping Pong the Animation]( * [Chihayafuru]( * [Kuragehime](  # Drama, life, and everything nice  * [March Comes in Like a Lion]( * [Sakamichi no Apollon]( * [Violet Evergarden]( * [Natsume Yuujinchou]( * [Mushishi](  # Light hearted fun for all  * [A Place Further Than the Universe]( * [Barakamon]( * [Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun]( * [The Disastrous Life of Saiki-K]( * [Ouran High School Host Club](  # Anyone up for movie night?  * [Wolf Children]( * [Sword of the Stranger]( * [Spirited Away]( * [Princess Mononoke]( * [The Night is Short, Walk on Girl](  # My guilty pleasure*: shit with swords  * [Akatsuki no Yona]( * [Arslan Senki]( * [Kingdom]( * [Samurai Champloo](  *Edit: since this causing some confusion, I don’t mean the shows themselves are guilty pleasures. I just really enjoy historical anime with cool sword fights for no other reason than I think swords are sick lol, which is why I call this genre my “guilty pleasure.”  Hopefully, you can find a few new shows to watch from this list. If not, I hope you can at least feel validated that one more Reddit stranger approves of your taste. And as mentioned before, if you have any recommendations, please do share. Cheers!",anime,j2cdyu
Should I get into Hunter x Hunter? I just finished the Black clover manga and the next thing on the list is HxH should I go for it?  Edit: Alright guys I'm convinced. Starting tomorow.

"What show is this from? (please, it's been a 3-year search) I posted this on r/anime and someone sent me to you so please, if you can, do your magic!  First time posting here so I apologize if I've done this wrong!  I started watching this anime out of boredom and procrastination a couple of years ago but accidentally closed my tab and was never able to find it again. The show is basically about a group of people who have to fight versions of themselves from a different timeline/universe. I think it begins with a boy following either a cat or his disappeared friend/sister and finds something important to the plot (possibly a portal). I know this isn't a lot to go off of, hence my trouble tracking it down. This is my last resort. If you know what it is please let me know!  edit: someone from the other thread knew what it was! The anime is called Gunslinger Stratos. Can't say it's any work of art but it's always bothered me that I lost it with only a little bit left until the end. It's alright if you need to watch something easy while you're working and not really paying attention but not as a next big hit binge lol",anime,mp5uno
Anime which has no fanservice but is good for my dad to watch cuz I'm 14 and don't want him to see anime tiddies.... Yet I showed him Steins gate and he loved it now he is watching Trigun but I also need something else to show him so any recommendations? Please,anime,nihny3
"Give me an anime where you watch it and go like ""Woah, the writers must've been so smart to think of that!"" kind of like Death Note or Dr. stone in a way. You know kind of when the MC is way less stronger than the bad guy and he's losing in a fight but he comes up with some 200 iq trick he thought beforehand before the fight that lets him defeat his opponent.   Also when the writers know a lot about certain subjects (such as science or history) it generally makes the anime much more enjoyable for me.  I have a few criteria though  2011 and above (however if there is an older series you insist on recommending because of how good it is then go ahead)  No stupid or overdramatic MC   No mech (Code geass gets a pass though)  Also here are some anime I have watched that fit the description imo  Code Geass  Attack on titan  Jojo's bizarre adventure  Death note  Hunter x Hunter  Dr Stone  The promised neverland  Steins;Gate",anime,j3ujl0

"Violet Evergarden is amazing {Violet Evergarden} is a story about a weaponized girl’s journey to learning and discovering the meaning behind the last words said by her major “I love you”.   God this show is so good. First off, this is the only anime that I have watch that have the animation and art work at a level of a Shinkai movie throughout the whole entire series, from the grand background shots to the Tiniest hand movement every single scene is stunning and well done to the most minor details. Honestly after this show, I can’t say any other anime show have good animation any more.   The bgm in this show fits perfectly with the theme and just makes the emotional scenes that much better.  the emotional build up throughout the entire series is insanely well executed. The anime never really say how violet have changed, but rather tell us the viewers how her feeling progress through subtle signs like hand movements, and her actions.   And HOLY SHIT episode 10...... episode 10 is the best executed anime episode in any anime I have seen imo. I swear the amount of tears I shed for that single episode can fill a whole bath tub.  Please, do your self a favorite and give this show a shot. Wether you are a blood thirsty shoneon action genre guy or a romance genre dude, you will find aspect of this show that connects with you emotionally.  Tip: The pacing is rather slow for this show and I advice at least watch 5 episode before you make up your mind wether you are going to drop it or not.  Tip 2 inspired by u/KJ_but_LT : don’t binge the whole series, take in around 2-3 episode each day. Since this show have a unique story every single episode with different characters, it’s best to watch 2 or 3 of those mini stories and just appreciate their value. This might help for people out there that can’t take slow shows.   Edit 1: just to be clear, even thought this is a Netflix “original” series, Netflix was not behind a single scene within the anime. They simply sign the contract saying that they will air the anime. All the credit should be given to Kyoto animations for the amazing series.  Edit 2: Kyoto animation also created a whole new alphabet, drew a map, designed all the clothing in the series to fit the geographic regions on the map they drew and they even animated most of the characters who are in the back ground just to make this show realistic. And they certainly achieved that.  Edit 3: forgot to mention that every single character in this anime have a different face. I mean literally every single character.",anime,glp2qi
"Odd Taxi is the hidden gem that deserves to be...uhh...unhidden ~~Zootopia 2~~ Odd Taxi is a hidden gem that deserves to be known. It truly deserves the praise, and I’m glad Gigguk did a video on it because I wouldn’t have watched it otherwise.  If you liked Tatami Galaxy, Durarara, Beastars, or Erased, you will enjoy Odd Taxi. Do not be put off by the art or use of animal characters - they have a purpose. Everything in this show has a purpose. You will never see something that does not become relevant at some point in the story.   It deals with mature themes through brilliant writing and has some of the most witty dialogue I’ve ever heard (read). With a no-nonsense, to-the-point 41-year-old protagonist, you won’t be getting any of that goofy UwU stuff. A good example of this is when he’s speaking to a younger individual  who pretends to not know what a cassette tape is. The MC’s response: “cut the generation gap crap.”   The cast is very diverse. Aside from the grumpy taxi driver, you have two failing comedians, a validation seeking college student, a coldhearted idol, a foolish criminal, a nice guy doctor, a corrupt cop, and many other interesting characters who all have a specific role in the story.   The soundtrack is extremely unique. It’s not the catchy kind but rather the kind that fits the scenes perfectly and keeps you immersed in their world. At times, it might even get your heart rate up. Also, the op is a banger in case you haven’t already listened to it.   This is one of those anime that doesn’t make any sense until the end, so make sure you’re paying close attention, and avoid spoilers at all costs! It is heavily reliant on execution. I mean, what would you expect from a series centred around a taxi driver?   Happy watching, fellow people of culture",anime,ogb8qn
"Dear mods, on behalf of the community, I respectfully ask that you lower the minimum word count for WT! posts to 250 (please read description) Before you remove this, please leave it up for a day and hear what the community has to say. I recently noticed a change to this subreddit (forgive me, I’m not the most active person so I’m a bit late on this). There is now a 500-word minimum requirement for WT! posts. This is too much. Please take the time to carefully read my explanation below. I understand that there were many pointless posts, recommendations without any useful information, if any at all. But a 500-word minimum is not the answer.   Most of my university essays are 1000-1500 words, and that’s at the university level. 500 is half an essay. Many people who are part of this subreddit can’t comfortably write that many words without putting in pointless filler, if they can at all. What about the younger anime fans? I rarely had to write 500 words until I started high school. What about those with less education? Or those who are studying engineering or science or something else? I have countless friends in STEM and they’re brilliant people but they can’t write worth crap. This rule is too strict.   Now, when I want to kick back and browse what could be a good subreddit, I have to read/write an essay? I’ve always been taught to be concise. That doesn’t mean 20 words. It means providing the essential details. For those who want to write more, they are welcome to. The answer is quality over quantity, not the other way around. The students who write 2000 words on 1000-word minimum essays don’t do any better than the rest of us. If anything, it annoys the professors (and their peers).   Few people have the patience to read that much, let alone write. Heck, I’ve struggled to get this many words into the post, and I have a lot to say. In fact, this is now the third time I will be posting because apparently the first two times I didn’t reach the minimum.   My rant continues below in the next paragraph but I am writing this because I have nothing else to say and I know that nobody wants to drown in my ramble. Ideally, this complaint could have been 250 and saved us all a lot of time. Nevermind, this is now my FOURTH time reposting. I’ve decided to finally copy paste this into a word processor to see where I’m at. 60 words to go! Again, the rant continues below. This is filler. I am looking forward to posting my 300-word WT! post for Kids on the Slope if this rule is changed. If not, I will no longer be posting on this subreddit. My word processor says that I am over the minimum but the automod says that is not the case, so here is an extra sentence to hopefully push me over the threshold and I can finally get back to anime instead of writing this post. You know what, I’m going to put another sentence here just to be safe. I hope you haven’t wasted time reading this far. This is equivalent to filler episodes in anime. Don’t watch them. If you are still reading though, I hope you have a nice day.   So, respectfully, mod(s), I ask, on behalf of the community, that you lower the minimum word count from 500 to 250. Already, that is at least one good-sized paragraph. They are always welcome to write more, but this way our less adept writers aren’t faced with stress when they’re trying to relax and browse this subreddit or quietly make a suggestion to the community. Subreddits with strict rules do not last long. We are unhappy with this new rule and we ask that you make the necessary change so that this subreddit can be happy once again.",anime,i1m34s

"Haikyu!! Is a masterpiece and Im not even a fan of sports anime. Haikyu!! (Or Haikyuu!!) is probably one of the coolest animes I've ever watched. I'm really not into sports animes but this one is so much more than that. It's about a high school boy who really short who loves volleyball and their clubs journey in tournaments and inm life. It's definitely a shonen but it's also so wholesome! I've rewatched it twice and each time I love it even more. If you haven't seen it, you definitely need to put it on your list!",anime,hk85p5
"Had no idea Violet Evergarden was so good. I'm only on episode 3 and it's already blowing my mind. The animation, the OST and it's movie like flow. It doesn't feel like an anime. I had first heard of Violet Evergarden after the horrible arson  attack at Kyoto Animation but only started watching it now, and it's heartbreaking seeing all these beautiful scenes knowing that some of the staff is no longer with us. It only adds to the bittersweetness that I already feel from the story.  Anyway, I just had to rant about it for a bit so now I'm gonna go right back into it.  Edit: Just got done watching episode 10 and you guys weren't lying. I was expecting what would happen in general but the ending caught me off guard. Once it started I couldn't turn off the waterworks. Incredible.",anime,gulqst
"My dad and I spend time together by watching AOT, but we're almost done with it and I'm looking for more series he might like that we can watch together as father-daughter bonding time He's a busy guy, so we don't do many things together. Watching movies has always been our thing, but since Covid happened we can't really do that. My brother convinced him to try watching Attack on Titan and it's unintentionally become our bonding time, and I want to keep it going for as long as possible!  He hasn't watched any anime at all except AOT and I think he really enjoys the story + action + mystery aspects.  I don't think he cares much about characters unless they have distinct personalities/are integral to the plot, like Hange (my fave) or Levi (his fave).  He was recommended Sword Art Online, so I think we'll start that next.  I don't know how much he'll like it because it's definitely different from AOT.  I'm just looking for suggestions.    What would a 55-year-old, old-fashioned Pops who's only seen one anime like to watch? (WAIT I FORGOT, He also watched Parasyte but didn't finish it. I think he lost interest)  We've only watched dub because he doesn't like reading the subtitles, so please recommend good dub anime!   (Also, please don't recommend anything with a shit ton of fan-service cause, uh, it'd be hella awkward to watch panty/boob shots/sexual stuff together. We watched Deadpool 1 in theaters and that was definitely an experience lmao I've never seen him so scared 😂)  Edit: Woah, I just woke up and I didn't expect so many recommendation for us. Thanks you!  I'm currently reading through every comment and am going to write all them down so we have a list!  Another edit:   Wow, thanks for all the recommendations!  I got a lot of comments saying he'd like Vinland Saga, Monster, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Shamploo, as well as a lot of others like Jujutsu Kaisen and movies like Akira. We certainly have a lot to watch when we ultimately catch up to S4 of AOT.  Thank you all again!",anime,mjv6ar
"Dr. Stone is a gem of a series and here’s why Potential Spoiler Warning beforehand.    Type: TV Series Episodes: 24 Status: Finished Airing Premiered: Summer 2019 Producers: TOHO animation, Shueisha LicensorsFunimation, Crunchyroll StudiosTMS Entertainment Genres: Adventure, Sci-Fi, Shounen Duration: 24 min. per ep. Rating: PG-13   “Even if you kill me, even if you kill anyone, even if you reset science… There’s always an idiot who will try anything and the shiny monkeys will inevitably create a technological civilization.” -Senku   Dr. Stone is a science fiction anime about the recreation of the world. What’s interesting about the series is that the science that’s going into Senku’s methods are entirely factual. Since everyone in the world has been turned to stone and since Senku wants to restart the world, it’s only natural for him to need a way to reverse the petrification. The world of Dr. Stone takes place as a post-apocalyptic setting 3,700 years into the future. The anime retains elements of the isekai genre but being set in the same world keeps it from being such. One of the most exciting parts about a post-apocalyptic setting is that there are no laws. Because of this, we see Senku taking the moral high ground of restoring the world and Tsukasa murdering the stone structures to prevent the world from being restored. A true battle of wits vs. muscle and science vs. strength.   Be warned, if you are expecting a show about reconstructing the 21st century within twenty-four episodes, you will be disappointed. In the first episode, Senku tells us his goals. I initially assumed this would be an action-adventure. Rather, this is an entertaining character-focused comedy about science. I understand why this direction frustrated a lot of people, unfortunately, it led to people picking apart the writing strawman criticisms. This series successfully uses what's known as an ‘unreliable narrator’ because the one telling the story can't be entirely trusted; this gives the series unpredictability, anything can happen. It’s exhilarating. It blows my mind that people have said the writing is shallow, without redeeming value, and lacking focus. I’m not going to pretend like this anime is perfect, but it’s way better than some would lead you to believe.   The main characters are so likable—not just for their personalities and chemistry—because they’re driven by their own personal goals. The writers make sure to give each member of the science squad a considerate amount of development. For some of them, it's only a few minutes shoved in-between arcs, but their development is visible throughout the rest of the show. I’ve said all I needed to say about Senku—he’s the heart of the show. His personality is rather subdued; he even admits that he prefers not to show much emotion, but the show always subtly clues us into how he's truly feeling. Kohaku is a spirited girl who takes no shit. Chrome is another avid science fan, but he's more relatable because he isn’t a super genius. Taiju and Yuzuihara are pleasant enough for the short time they’re in the show.  The humor is really overexaggerated but well-executed. It relies entirely on your interest in the characters and the comedic timing. Thankfully the editing in Dr. Stone is top-notch. Every part of the audiovisual production works in unison. The BGM, openings, and endings were all superb. This is the best soundtrack I’ve heard in a while. Each background song is deftly synced up with scene transitions and set pieces. Jokes land with boisterous sound effects. Absurd facial expressions pop-up on the screen, lined-up perfectly with the joke’s punchline. I understand why people have criticized the comedy for being ‘simplistic,’ to put it nicely. The jokes mainly rely on the character chemistry and, fantastic directing aside, I think they have hilarious chemistry. Other than the stellar character artwork (warning: some of the female faces are borderline Lovecraftian horrors), the backgrounds are consistently beautiful. The voice acting in both the English and Japanese dub is fantastic as well. The world building of the show for me is top-notch and is slow to build without being rushed.   Even for me who’s not very good at chemistry, the science behind every innovation Senku develops amazes me and drives me to learn more about what he’s making just for the knowledge. Genuinely inventing the technological world from the ground up is such an unique concept that no other anime for me has really been able to live up too.  Very unusual character design. Senku's character design is easily to remember. Also I love his personal trait too. He likes to tease everyone with science. What a badass character yet so unique. But even he likes to tease everyone, he is indirectly teaching us about science. I can say this is very innovative way to teach science for kids!  From what I have seen, I can safely say that I have been craving a show like this for a while. an isekai show without someone horribly overpowered for no reason and no real villains. This show satisfies my ich for strong characters and clashing ideals from the protagonist and antagonist that will lead to a deeper level of character growth and mold a meaningful story.    A second season is also predicted for the coming January so now would be the best time to pick up this one of a kind series!",anime,i1yrb2

"Please consider watching the anime film WOLF CHILDREN! Wolf Children depicts the struggles and joys of a mother raising her two children who have the ability to turn into WOLVES (*Yeah, you heard me right).* Therefore, as much as how the mother loves her children, it is clear that she would face challenges caring for them like no other moms would!  Viewers will be able to relate to the family as they gradually see different approaches the mother took, and the dilemmas she faced *(Which can be hilarious at time)* in an attempt to better care for her wolf children due to their wild nature. However, as the movie progresses, it is evident that her children will not be able to able to integrate and blend in with society. With little choice, the mother decided to bring her children along and moved to the countryside, hoping that the change in environment will be beneficial to her children.  Due to their wolf-human nature, the mother hopes that her children will be able to decide for themselves what kind of life they truly wish to lead in future.  As time passes by, the two children gradually grew and have better understanding of themselves. This is where I believe the climax of the movie takes place, as you are able to relate to the striking contrasts in both of the children's decisions which are shaped by their experiences as they grew up in the countryside. The mother initially was worried for them and wanted her children to stay by her side, but she eventually, selflessly, lets them go as she have promised to let them find their own path. The fact that the Wolf children are empowered to live their lives the way they want really warms me up.  Salute the mother as she have worked very very hard for her children!. From the beginning till the end of the film. The struggles she faced as mentioned...the transition to rural life...all for her children. I will give her mother of the decade award.  All of this leads to a conclusive ending, at least for me, in which every character have a 'happy ending' and have matured a lot since the beginning of the movie. There is some fantasy to this movie because the children have the ability to turn into wolves as mentioned, but that's about it. It is still an awesome slice of life movie that one will be able to relate to, especially when you think from the main characters' point of perspective!  If you enjoy slice of life anime, then WOLF CHILDREN is FOR YOU! Furthermore, it has a running time of only 2 hours, which I am sure is not too much time  for the majority of Redditors here! Feel free to correct me if I am wrong, but I believe this anime film deserves more recognition!  And this concludes my review! Do give this anime film a shot! Share it with others if you enjoyed it as well! Thank you for reading!",anime,lpqvrg

"I've never seen a show that portrays the effects of abuse as well as Fruits Basket (2019) On the surface, Fruits Basket is a cutesy shojo anime about a girl who meets the Soma family. Members of the Soma family are affected by a strange curse which causes them to turn into cute  zodiac animals whenever they're hugged by someone of the opposite sex.   At first, that doesn't seem that bad, right? The atmosphere of the show is comforting and wholesome. The art is bright and colorful, the characters are expressive and vivid, and everything is sunshine and rainbows. Our protagonist, Tohru, is a ray of sunshine who is always kind and thinks of others before herself. Most of the time, we see things through her eyes, so we don't know the truth about the Somas.  Lurking underneath the pretty colors and goofy shenanigans is a dark secret: the Soma family 'curse' is much more than it seems on the surface. I won't provide any spoilers, but I will say that there is some \*seriously\* dark content to this show. Manipulation, trauma, and physical and psychological abuse are deeply rooted in the story. Don't expect a Madoka Magica genre switch or gruesome horror. Instead, this show is a slow burn. As the story unfolds, we see more and more of the twisted underside of the Soma family.   The effects of this abuse are gut-wrenching. Pretty much every member of the Soma family has a tragic or painful past. Their funny personality traits aren't just quirks the writer added for laughs. Why do the two male leads hate each other and constantly get into fights? Why does one Soma have a violent 'dark' side that comes out when he's upset? Why does another Soma constantly apologize for everything? These qualities didn't come out of nowhere. They're there for a reason. They are the manifestations of years of abuse.   This show has one of the best villains I've ever seen. They're not a badass hell bent on taking over the world. They simply want to have complete control over the twelve members of the Soma family. Control over who they are allowed to love, how they are allowed to act, and where they are allowed to go.   The stakes are much lower in this show than in many others. The world isn't at stake. It's just the lives of the members of the Soma family. However, because the stakes are lower, we get much more personal. There's tremendous character growth. We truly feel the pain inflicted by the villain and witness how much it has been engrained in the lives of the Soma family.   I started this show looking for a wholesome, cute romance. Now, I'm so much more moved by the stories of these characters and I'm rooting for them to break the curse. I definitely recommend this show if you're interested in character drama and development.",anime,l0nndn
"Watch rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai ASAP! Dude this show was amazing and the movie made it even better! Im usually into dark and action anime but its nice to take a break every now and then to watch some sol/romance animes. This one had me interested from start to finish and after finishing the movie, i felt the same vibes i felt after finish clannad after story and your lie in april. It made me want to fall in love HAHA and reminded me to cherish every moment so all in all definitely worth the watch guys!",anime,hhbudp

"Every part of JoJo's bizzare adventure OR , why you should watch JoJo's bizzare adventure. So from your recommendations I finally gave JoJo's a shot and fuck it was amazing.   Jojo's has total 5 parts , Part 1 having 9 episode, part 2 with 17 episodes , part 3 the biggest part having 48 episodes and part 4 and 5 having 39-39 episodes each.  Part 1 is the weakest , having a great protagonist with a basic story and amazing antagonist , many people could not endure these 9 episodes and drop the anime but this part also has its importance and the most pure protagonist. One must see this part   Part 2 is for me a fun ride , with great story , better protagonist and with more humorous elements this part totally outdid part 1 amd has literally the immortal protagonist.  Battles in part 2 are amazing, strategic and highly entertaining , you never feel bored and is highly manly.  Part 3: Stardust crusaders is considered the best because of the introduction of stands this was the only thing JoJo's was missing . With the most edgy protagonist and the best side characters this part's best part is it's cast . The battles are even more strategic now . Our heroes go from Japan to Egypt In 50 days to beat an evil entity. Those who skips parts start from this very part , but part 1 and 2 plays very Important role in the story so please dont skip any part. This part contributed a lot to the meme community and many watches this part to understand the memes.   Part 4: Now the anime's tone is shifted from manly shonen to slice of life murder mystery . Protagonist is a kid whom we can relate to , the cast is a bit more friendly and this part has the best villain in the anime . Whenever he is on screen you won't feel bored for a moment . There is so much that you want to know about the antagonist and crave to see him on the screen. This part is the best (imo) with the best villain , great cast, great openings (chase is great, fuck off haters) and one of the best ending.  Part 5: This part isn't about a single protagonist it's about a gang and every member from the gang has their significance , backstory and contribution to the story.  This is a sudden shift from part 4, this part is beyond amazing with the best ost .  Not to mention this part has so many plot holes.  This is the most bizzare part in the saga for example we have a guy drinking piss, sex pistols, guy killing himself with banana, talking turtle and strippers fighting strippers.    To sum up ,jjba is an anime you should totally watch every part has different protagonist and different plot that are somehow connected . This particular anime contributes the most to meme community.  Don't skip parts every part has its own ups and downs and believe me , if you are hesitating if you should watch this or not give it a try and you will fall in love with this bizzare anime.  The battles are amazing and strategic and after move you will think""damn that is possible why didn't I think of that"" .     It total has 8 parts (part 8 is still going on)   Total 5 parts are animated and part 6(stone ocean) and part 7(steel ball run) are even better , if you complete all 5 parts , I know you could not stop yourself from reading those  (I am sorry if my english is a bit poor , I am not a native English speaker)  Thanx for reading this long ass post",anime,j9mxe2
"Just finished Steins;Gate and it was phenomenal, but now I cant seem to find any other anime I can enjoy I've binged Steins;Gate for 2 days, and after finishing it, it really left a hole in my heart. Ive tried rewatching to fill the emptiness but given how the show is constructed, it doesnt feel the same anymore after the first watch. Im really hoping to find something similar to steins;gate.

"I Miss HxH I like HxH’s take on a unique setting (not isekai) while still applying very human problems to each character. Gon and Killua’s relationship is endlessly heartwarming, but I still enjoy the shounen aspect of the anime. I like this kind of contrast that focuses both on action/adventure and character development/relationships without feeling cheesy. Dororo does this as well with Hyakkimaru and Dororo; their growth just feels pleasant to watch.",anime,l11jzg

"If you haven't already seen Your Lie In April, it's must-watch. Your Lie in April, also known as Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, is in my eyes a masterpiece. The story's follows prodigy pianist Kousei Arima, who was so good he was often called the 'Human Metronome,' known for not missing a note, and playing like a machine. However, after the passing of his mother, Saki Arima, he's unable to hear the sound of his own piano, since the shock and pain left him scarred.   ""Two years later, Kousei still avoids the piano, leaving behind his admirers and rivals, and lives a colorless life alongside his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari. However, everything changes when he meets a beautiful violinist, Kaori Miyazono, who stirs up his world and sets him on a journey to face music again.""  &#x200B;  This anime was one that got me thoroughly invested in Classical Music, too.

"Watch ""Your Name."", it's one hell of a ride on emotion rollercoaster I just watched ""Your Name."" and it blew me off my feet. Personally I believe it has got to be one of the best anime movies out there with ""The Wind Rises"". It's plot is simple enough, yet the way it's presented keeps your mind on edge throughout the whole 107 minutes, supported by amazing animation and a great soundtrack.  I can't stress enough just how much it's worth a watch.",anime,ggpo5a
"An Anime to help me feel loved and validated again. I have to get a bit personal for this one. I was in a mentally abusive relationship with my girlfriend for a year, the entire time she would gaslight me and tell me how my opinions were wrong and harmful to her cause she didn’t like them and eventually broke up with me and got my own support system to turn against me and leave me. It’s been a really traumatic experience for me causing PTSD and having to go to therapy.  I’m begging that there is an anime out there that can help me feel validated in any way.   I’ve always watched The Rising of the Shield Hero and that has helped me a lot and was wondering if there was anything else out there for me, I know this was a super long post but if you have any suggestions please let me know.

"Animes that would make a emotionless human cry I am allways seeing the recomendations you give for ""sad anime"" or ""anime that will make you cry"" but I cannot cry on those even if I try. Out of the ""sad animes"" I've seen these:  Clannad and After Story  Violet Evergarden  Your Name  Silent Voice  Plastic Memories  5cm per second  Angel Beats  Your Lie in April  Anohana  Assassination Classroom  Charlotte  Death Parade  Garden of Words  Golden Time  I wanna eat your pancreas  Shuumatsu  Sangtsu no Lion  Bunny Girl Senpai  Orange  FMAB  White Album 2  Erased  Etc...  None of these made me even close to crying, I know the moments were I am supposed to cry (sometimes) but I just cant, the closest I've been to crying was the steins gate 0 finale when >!okarin recovered his personality after being depressed af!< but still is sort of a hype crying instead of a sad crying.  What sad animes am I missing?  Edit:   if you dont know any more animes that would make me ""sad cry"" then you can give me some that would make me ""hype cry""  Edit2:   Adding Animes I am being remembered Ive seen  Edit3:   For people with the same problem as me, here are some of the most frequently commented recommendations besides seeing a therapist:  Tokyo Magnitude 8.0  Grave of the Fireflies  Devilman Crybaby  Parasyte  One Piece  Maquia  177013  Made in Abyss  Banana Fish  Kiznaiver  Mushishi  Nana  A place further than the universe  Now and then, here and there  Rainbow  HunterXHunter  Highschool DxD  Jojo  In this corner of the world  Kanon  Zenkyou no Terror  Fruits Basket  Colorfull  Madoka Magica  Vinland Saga",anime,giwrae
"To people who are asking for anime suggestions I’m like a lot of people on this sub, constantly looking for anime suggestions.  But something hit me yesterday.   You don’t have to have people suggest you anime all the time, some times, it’s best to just click on that anime in your watch list and give it a shot. Not including its genre, rating, or even comments about it.  This thought hit me after I had the chance to watch {flavor of youth}. I’ve never heard about this movie until I saw it on Netflix, the rating is not great on mal but I gave it a shot anyways   And I loved the hell out of it. The setting and the stories just really hits me hard. There was a point where I ugly cried simply over the noodle scene, just because I haven’t had a bowl of traditional Chinese noodles in so long.   Every anime hits someone differently. And there will be one anime that you will relate to out there.   Just sit down, and watch some anime  Edit: I guess I should be a little more specific. This post is meant for people who ask for suggestions but never actually watch anything. Instead of trying to guess what you want to watch. Just sit down and watch something.",anime,gxrvwa

"Shows to watch together with my 15-year-old son preferably dubbed My son loves anime. I love my son...  Since many of you have mentioned his age, this post is not about what he's mature enough to watch, he watches whatever he wants on his own. But it's nice to find shows to watch together that appeal to both of our taste (I don't like a lot of violence and the fan service is cringy for me) and that's where we are coming up short!  Looking for cute, sweet or fantasy shows that don't have a lot of fan service or violence and are preferably dubbed.   So far we've watched k-on, uri on ice, dragon maid,  bloom into you, your lie in april and all of the ghibli movies a million times, probably a couple more but you get the picture. We watched Naruto and pokemon when he was younger but that definitely appealed to him more than me.   Really appreciate all of your responses! ❤️❤️",anime,kz9ggg
"""Adult"" anime? No, not that kind of adult anime. I'm talking about slice of life focusing on adults instead of the usual high schoolers.

Anything that isn't too childish or relies on fanservice is good enough for me :)  Edit: sorry for not being clear guys, I dont consider anime like Promised Neverland a short anime since it's not finished after 13 episodes, I'm talking about series that are done by that point  Edit 2: My first reddit awards!

"I'm in a really dark place mentally & immunocompromised in South Dakota. I would appreciate some anime recommendations to help get through this. I'm sorry to ask like this, but I'm immunocompromised in the world's Covid-19 hotspot. I haven't left my house for anything except doctors appointments since March. I'm starting to get into a really dark place mentally. My husband is helping me, but I don't want to place more of a burden on him than what I already have. So I want to distract myself as much as I can.  Here is my anime list I put together just now.  The only genre I dislike is horror/gore. I don't necessarily need any 'soothing healing' anime, just a good story. I just caught up with Haikyuu for example.  Thanks for any recommendations.    Edit:  Wow! I just woke up, as I wrote this going to bed. Thank you all so much for the recommendations! I am overwhelmed by how many I got & how amazing you all are! I have so many I am ready to watch now.

"I am not typically a fan of action, but Vinland Saga is one of the best animes I've seen Especially when we only look at newer animes.  I have always found that the action genre is either heavily lacking in character department or is just too childish, having unnecessary humour sprinkled throughout the show, but Vinland Saga is nothing like that. The characters are very deep and interesting, there is a lot of attention to plot details, and the show gets interesting from the very first episode. Believe me when I tell you there is a lot of deeper meaning in this show (I mean it's based on a critically acclaimed manga). Furthermore, it's a story about Vikings, so I appreciate how the action scenes consist of more than just bright colourful explosions.  That's not to mention the animation being stunning. It's not too flat (a common problem with contemporary anime), with facial expressions and character designs being superb, and an insane amount of detail in the background.  Some background on me, I dropped Attack on Titan after 7 episodes for being too boring. This TV show is definitely one to check out since it has broad appeal and gets interesting fast.",anime,haj40l
"Underrated/Must-Watch Anime Rarely Mentioned This is my first post since being active on this account again and I've seen that a lot of people ask for certain anime of a specific taste but they can never be satisfied or quite hit the mark on what they want so that's where I come in.  I wanted to introduce some nice taste-breakers and unique storylines/characters of anime that are not mentioned that much on this subreddit because it pains my heart that some of these people have not watched the following anime:  **I WILL SKIP ALL SYNOPSES DUE TO THE BOT PROVIDING THE MyAnimeList LINKS!!**  {Dororo}  \- This anime mainly focuses on the story of what it means to be human and what exactly the concept of ""revenge"" entails. Is revenge justified? How much will you pay for the price of salvation and to get back what you lost? Very, very, very good anime with lots of action and will make you question your resolve in life.  &#x200B;  {Darker than Black}  \- Holy shit the number of times I see people recommending dark action-anime with an extremely subtle romance subplot and I don't see this anime being mentioned could actually bring tears to my eyes lmfao. This anime is slightly old and shows clear signs of a 2000's-style animation but the story progresses slowly until around the middle of the first season and pieces of the puzzle are put together and the suspense will leave you binging this entire series. Like other deep anime, this series tackles a very sci-fi and trippy setting and juggles themes like sacrifice, motive, purpose, and cost. What is the cost of your humanity? **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE WATCH THIS ANIME**  &#x200B;  {Katanagatari}  -This anime is also another extremely underrated one due to the fact that the voice actors are not that popular and each episode is 45 minutes. However, as the “-gatari” suggests, this story of a ronin and a strategist will captivate you and tie you into its fascinating setting and art style in an instant. Katanagatari deals a lot with morally gray characters as well as the rise and fall of clans and dynasties as depicted throughout the show. Some darker concepts are loss, sacrifice, frustration, guilt, and family which play a huge role throughout the story but the MAIN theme is definitely PURPOSE. The main character’s motive and purpose to journey is constantly questioned and makes the story that much more fun to follow. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ANIME.   {Kekkai Sensen}  \- This is an extremely action-packed anime that not only provides a very intriguing backstory on the protagonist but appropriately delves into the stories behind the supporting characters. Themes like love, purpose, family, dignity, and compassion are juggled throughout this anime as our seemingly ""weak"" protagonist struggles to adapt to his newfound power and life in a city of hell. **The action scenes are also animated mainly by Yuki Hayashi and Yutaka Nakamura so you know they're absolutely insane.**  &#x200B;  {Daily Lives of High School Boys}  \- This anime is extremely funny and has humor on the same level as Grand Blue and close to Gintama. There are so many different side characters with such unique and amusing personalities that the interactions between them will make your sides hurt. It mainly focuses on the main trio of boys whose schemes and skits are just so out of the ordinary and absurd that you can't help laughing.  &#x200B;  {Charlotte}  \- I don't really see this being mentioned all that often but this anime is definitely the best definition of a ""DECENT ANIME."" It's nothing too special: just a bunch of high schoolers in a club with special abilities who go and make sure other people don't misuse their powers but the story takes a slightly dark turn around the middle and the story picks up so quickly. There is a slight romance subplot and some action but the drama is really what makes it stand out.  That's just a few of the anime because I don't wanna swamp you guys with a shitload of anime but if you start with these, you'll see yourself identifying good elements in other underrated anime and will be able to enjoy other lesser-mentioned anime.",anime,jxfn8n

"This year my already diagnosed mental illness took a hit with 2020. Anime helped me cope in the past. I want to get back into it. Recommendations for a goal of an anime per week? Also the same for manga. I'm sorry, but I'm nervous writing this post. Please forgive me if it doesn't communicate well.   This year, like so many, my mental health took a massive hit. I am immunocompromised and also take medicine that lowers my immune system. I have not been able to leave my home except for medical appointments since March. I live in the US in a state where my governor is VERY anti-mask as well, so it's been hard to even go on a walk outside somedays.   However, in the past one way I have always coped with some rough times with mental health going poorly - along with regular therapy & medicine - is to become very invested in anime. Gintama literally saved me from a severe mental breakdown.  In 2020, I wasn't able to focus on Anime and stepped away from it. With everything going on, it was too hard to focus on. However, I want to make a goal of watching at least 1 anime (average 12 ep.) a week. I feel that this would help 'ground' me and calm me down as it has in the past. It helps me focus on a story rather than worry about everything else currently.   I am also interested in doing the same for manga to where I want to read a completed one every month (if it is long) or start an ongoing one.   My anime list is below. I use Anilist rather than MAL. Sorry if that is inconvenient.  My favorites are Chihayafuru, Gintama, Dr. Stone, Fruits Basket, Haikyuu, & Attack on Titan.  I would greatly appreciate it.    Edit: I forgot to add what manga I have read on the Anilist profile. I will try to do that after dinner & time with my husband.  Edit #2: I also don't mind longer anime at all! I just want to average a 12 ep/week of whatever.  Edit #3: Oh wow! I am so overwhelmed & happy! I spent the night with my husband away from my phone & then just woke up and saw all the amazing replies! Thank you all so, so much! I want to put together a calendar now and start my ""New Year's Resolution"" of anime. I cannot thank you all enough. You are all awesome!""",anime,ko2vg0

"One episode a day... Gintama I get it, you probably see a Gintama post on here a lot, every weeb and their mother knows what Gintama is. But that’s not going to stop me from writing this to you. Because you have to watch Gintama  I haven’t even finished the show, I’m only on episode 129, but I’ve fallen in love.  This is more than a comedy spoof show. So much more. Yes, there’s crude humor, and yes, there’s a million Japanese references I probably don’t understand (or have to rewind every so often to read the subtitle notes). But it’s all part of the Gintama charm.   The comedy itself is top notch. You might be thinking to yourself “poop jokes aren’t funny, I’m too sophisticated for that.” And you’re wrong. Plus the comedy in this show is much much deeper. The character conversations, spontaneous jokes, and the overall delivery is great. It just forces you to laugh, in an enjoyable way.   And while the show is episodic in a sense, it really never feels that way, more like a continuous journey (to pay rent). But honestly, whether it’s a one episode story, 2-5 episodes, or more; the amount of emotions packed into each really is unbelievable. They make you feel happy, sad, proud, and sometimes just confused. I swear I always think, to myself that the next arc can’t be better, can’t show me any more of a character, and can’t live up to all I’ve read about. And I’m wrong 110% of the time. Every arc, no matter how small, makes me smile by the end, and glad I watched it.   Did I mention that every OP and ED is an absolute banger??! I have yet to ever skip any even once, rare for a show with so many episodes. (OP 1 & 5 have been my favorites so far). The OST itself is also awesome too, if you’re a fan of that kind of stuff.   While I still have a long way to go to finish this show, I can’t wait to continue to learn more about the characters and their pasts, and what’s in store for them moving forward. By the way, there is an overall plot to this, check out r/Gintama FAQs (idk how to link sorry), that’s what inspired me to start this show, it’s so passionate and detailed, you can tell they love the show. And I couldn’t help but buy in after reading it.   400 episodes seems like a lot, but if you watch one per day, you’ll be nearly done by end of year. And trust me, once you watch one, you’ll find it hard to stop. I’ll be done long before then I hope. Make this your late New Years resolution, you won’t regret it  Enjoy everyone!!",anime,l2crzl

"6 years ago I recommended Natsume yuujinchou, I'm here again. I am currently listening to the [OST]( of [Natsume Yuujinchou, or Natsume's Book of Friends]( if you prefer that name. It made me remember that around 6 years ago I posted a recommendation on here. So today, I thought I would once again recommend you, what I consider to be one of the best anime I have ever watched.   Natsume Yuujinchou is about a boy, Takashi Natsume, who can see youkai and is seen as creepy by his surroundings for being able to do so. His circumstance has made him excluded from society and a loving family throughout his entire life. Takashi is being harassed by youkai because they want to get their name back, which his grandmother, Reiko Natsume collected during her life and put them in her *Book of Friends*. Throughout the show you will get to know Takashi more and more, and understand what he has been through and see him grow as an individual, creating new bonds with both humans and youkai. You will also meet a lot of youkai, with each having their own story and very often if not always, bittersweet endings that will make you come back for more.   It has been ~6-7 years since I first watched Natsume Yuujinchou, but the soundtrack is something that I will always come back to. It is phenomenal and it incredibly relaxing to listen to, and in the anime it creates a soothing atmosphere, it is simple, but incredible. The openings and endings are also great in itself, and I personally enjoyed every single one of them, especially the endings are just amazing, it fits so well after the youkai have gotten their name back.   Natsume Yuujinchou is episodic, which might not be for everyone, but I would still recommend that you give it a try. Because every episode (or a few) will make up a story and have an ending with the youkai getting their name back. It sounds simple, but for me, every episode was more enjoyable and had a more satisfying ending than some of the many 12-24 episode seasons I have previously seen. With more complex characters and plot than some anime can create in multiple seasons, Natsume Yuujinchou does it in 20 minutes.   There are currently 6 seasons of Natsume Yuujinchou, and you can watch them on Crunchyroll if you so decide to. It is however under the name Natsume Yujin-cho and the rest will go under Natsume Yujin-cho 4,5,6.   I don't have much more to say, hopefully some will give it a try, see you in another 6 years :)",anime,jzry05

"Welcome to the NHK is CRIMINALLY underrated Welcome to the NHK! was a show i watched a little over 2 months ago and i'm still obsessed with it.  the story revolves around a group of people facing everyday problems, which brings us to the main character, tatsuhiro satou. he is a college dropout and a NEET, deemed a ""hikikimori"", a social outcast who sits inside all day unless completely necessary (buying food). he also is somewhat of a conspiracy theorist having picked up this trait from an old influencer, thinking the government has made him the way he has been.   a strange girl meets him one day and says she can fix his ""hikikimori ways"" and promises that she can save his life, wanting to appear as a guardian angel that has come to save him.   the show handles horribly deep and mostly relatable subjects for everyone now stuck in quarantine or just feel like they have nothing going for them in their lives. it handles the themes of social anxiety, feelings of demotivation and uselessness, depression, the feeling of wasting your life, the pressure of society, secrets from the government being hidden from society, societies social hierarchy, suicide, and a lot more. it truly feels like an eye-opener to me even though i'm not even in college yet, though it will be soon. it applies so many underlying messages like the meaning of life, and what people find the true meaning of it is, which is usually that it is meaningless.  the show is only even more powerful with its so amazing and moving OSTs, the osts are played exactly where they should be really setting the tone. either if it's empty, sad, upbeat, or empowering, i feel the OSTs really make this show so much more including and strong to the viewer.   it was an eye opener to me and many others that  really felt like a wake-up call, to look around you and benefit from what life has to offer while you can. this anime has easily become my favorites of all time and i feel like anyone can take away at least one life lesson and really apply it to themselves   it is a psychological drama with dark themes as stated before (depression, suicide, even a bit of pedophilia, anxiety, and even drug usage in the manga/LN) but also is pretty funny at times. the character interactions feel so smooth and they always seem to feel so real to the characters, you feel so engaged whenever they are doing something, almost like you are watching it first-handedly. it did come out a while ago so it animation isn't top notch but it's easy to get used to.   i never hear it talked about anymore despite how relatable to many it has been and how it has left viewers both motivated to make the best out of their life while they have the chance to while also giving the viewer a bit of bittersweet depression. some of the scenes are honestly so hard to watch just because of how much people relate to them, which i think is why it is such a powerful show. tackling the many things in life that most of the human population can relate to and emphasizing it to the point where it is screaming out to you basically.  i never thought an anime could change my perspective on life as much as this show did, but hopefully it can for you if you give it a chance.",anime,hqlrqg

"In wake of the tragedy, some KyoAni shows to watch An arsonist set fire to Kyoto Animation's Studio 1 today, with at least 23 presumed dead. In wake of the tragedy, I'd like to share some of my favorite KyoAni series.  [Full Metal Panic? Fummofu]( - A spinoff-series of Full Metal Panic, focused on comedy. If you haven't seen the original series it's preferable to watch it first, but to sum up, Sousuke Sagara is a mercenary who was raised on the battlefield that's sent to protect Kaname Chidori, a girl who holds the key to unlocking super-advanced technology. In Fumoffu, the focus is on their daily life and misadventures as you can take the child soldier out of the battlefield, but you can't take the battlefield out of the child solider. ([Clip](  [Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu]( / [Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu]( - The series follows an ordinary boy named Kyon and his misadventures around a girl (Haruhi) who has interest in the supernatural, but doesn't realize all of the supernatural phenomena she causes. The cast includes time travelers, ESPers, and artificial alien lifeforms trying to live a simple school life while monitoring the unaware goddess. The movie especially is a masterpiece, but will require watching the series first to appreciate. I do recommend sticking with it and watching the entirety of the Endless Eight arc, as it sets a good mindset for the movie. ([clip from series](  There's often a bit of confusion on the best watch order- I recommend just watching it in whatever order it's presented to you in, it's good either way.  [Lucky Star]( - May be one of the shows along with [K-On!]( (another KyoAni series) that really kicked off the CGDCT boom. A show about nothing- the first episode is just a discussion on how to eat a pastry. But it has a lot of social commentary, is self-aware, and is full of anime references especially of but not limited to other KyoAni productions. Enjoyable just for the meta-ness alone. (e.g. [Haruhi-themed cafe]( [Fumoffu karaoke](  There's plenty of others I could mention, but I'm getting too emotional to write much more. Even if you've seen all of these, [explore their works]( I can't say I've ever seen a bad KyoAni show. If you like what you find, consider buying the DVD/Bluray or official merchandise to support them in their time of need. Sentai Filmworks has also set up a GoFundMe to support them, for any who wish to contribute that way.  Feel free to use this thread to recommend any other Kyoto Animation series you'd like to share or talk about.  **Update**: Thank you mods, for the sticky. It's good to see so many fans sharing their support for KyoAni and recommending their favorite shows.  As /r/Animesuggest is all about helping, I'd like to ask the conversations here be kept to positive things, and not for example on who would do this or why. /r/anime has a [megathread on the incident itself]( with much more information.  Kyoto Animation will never die.",anime,ceqwhb

Noragami is just such a beautiful, poignant, and bittersweet look at how we navigate the relationships and families we find ourselves in.

"If you are an anime fan, you have to watch 'Violet Evergarden'. I am talking about the juggernaut, **Violet Evergarden.**  Violet Evergarden defines the beauty of anime. This anime has almost everything which makes it a masterpiece. Probably many of you have seen it already, but if you haven't, you should definitely check it out.   We come across several emotional anime like YLIA, Fruits Basket, Clannad, Anohana, Assassination Classroom, etc, but Violet Evergarden is probably the most unique one. Because it has an ability which other anime don't have. That ability is to make you emotional in only one episode. Other emotional anime generally describes an event or incident over a number of episodes and then suddenly the feeling of desolation hits hard. It helps in building up the emotions. That's what happened in YLIA, Anohana, Assassination Classroom, Clannad, etc. But you get the same thing in every single episode of Violet Evergarden. The series has only 13 episodes, but when you reach the end, it feels like you've seen a huge series, because several small stories are shown in the anime. Mark my words, each and every episode is just awesome.  Now in short, to describe the plot, I will only say that Violet Evergarden is all about the meaning of three words: **""I love you""**. This show deals with love of all kinds: romance, family, siblings, parents, friends, etc. If you think that this is crappy, then sorry to say, but you've lost your humanity. The story of this anime is set in an alternate 19th century when telephones had not been invented yet and people had to send letters to communicate with others who are far away. Many people did not know how to write. This resulted in the creation of the job of young girls who were called ""Auto Memory Dolls"". They would travel anywhere for their clients to write letters for them. Violet Evergarden is one such doll and the anime shows her journey from being an emotionless 'tool of war' to someone who treasured each and every emotion connected to her.   I am so grateful to Kyoto Animations for the animation. I've seen many anime, but Violet Evergarden has the best animation so far. It covers even the minutest details and the movements of the characters are enough to show what they want to say. The soundtrack is one of the best in the modern era of anime. The background music throughout the series makes this show a really gorgeous one. The characters are very important and bear a unique relationship with Violet. And last but not the least, the visuals and the beautiful world shown in the series is one of the reasons why I watched it. Taking all these things into consideration, I don't think someone can hate this series. Infact, it's a show you never want to end.  Also, the series has two sequels(movies) which are even better than the series.   If you have not watched this anime yet, I beg you please do so. It's an earnest request! Please! It's a relic and a once in a lifetime show!   Edit: Sorry for the title. I just typed it out of hype perhaps. But trust me, this anime is worth a watch.",anime,qix64w

Honestly I watched almost all the longer series at that pace and after reading all the comments i feel like i am a weirdo and at the same time i feel like its a great achievement lol.

"NETFLIX ANIME: “A Whisker Away” is a MUST WATCH (Romance/Fantasy/Slice of Life/ comedy) So I just finished watching Netflix’s new anime movie called “A Whisker Away”... IT WAS SO GOOD  the movie is about a girl who has a crush on a guy at her school. He always ignores her, so she turns into a cat in order to be able to get his attention (to put it simply so you can watch it with the full experience. In reality, it’s way more complicated).  I know, weird.   This movie is so so heart-warming and will make your emotions go from super happy to really sad... if u like that kind of rollercoaster, I suggest this movie!!   • Every character has depth and you can easily fall in love with all of them.   • The animation and art style is flawless. I love how simple and aesthetically pleasing it is to the eye  • The movie feels like a journey and you’re constantly on ur heels- it’s like when ur reading a book and you can’t stop reading the next page  Overall, if you like Romance, heart break, and heartwarming stories, I 100% suggest this movie. You won’t regret it. 💓💓💓  EDIT: this movie is clearly not for everyone, and that’s ok. I just wanted to share my review so that people who might really enjoy it can watch it. This movie is definetely not Ghibli or Makoto Shinkai level, but it’s a good movie that deserves praise. That’s all :) 👍",anime,hbu6r5
"Watch “My little Monster”if you want an under appreciated romcom Like bunny girl senpai, the title is totally misleading but if you want a wholesome anime that has both romance and comedy then its worth a watch. It’s basically about a delinquent who got in a fight on the first day of school and got suspended and hasn’t come to school since. The girl is told to deliver him the hw he has missed to his house by their teacher. And then it kicks off from there. Plenty of humour and its funny how she is aiming for top of the class when the delinquent (Haru) actually came first in the entrance exams but wasn’t there for the opening speech.  The actual anime is from 2013 and is 13ep long. The art and voice actors are pretty good not going to lie.",anime,gh1rbk

"If you like steampunk, espionage, and cute girls, you need to watch Princess Principal, the most overlooked anime of all time! Rewatching Princess Principal recently, and my god how does this anime not have a lot of attention???  First time posting, but I gotta say this. Honestly one of the most overlooked anime in recent years, Princess Principal sets the bar high for story telling and character development. And with the movie Crown Handler streaming on HIDIVE last week, now is the best time to watch it. For those of you who don’t know what it’s about, here’s a brief summary:   In the Early 20th Century, the working class of London revolts against the ruling party, leading the country of Britain to split into two; the Commonwealth and Kingdom of Albion, the latter being a successful country utilizing the power of Cavorite, a strange material recently discovered. Between these two nations, a bitter secret war for supremacy brews as the rival nation’s spies compete for dominance. This is where we see a Commonwealth spy team consisting of femme fatales operate missions and infiltrate the Kingdom. These women are:  Ange: A spy who uses a ball of Cavorite to float and control objects!  Chise: A samurai who excels at the blade.  Princess: The next in line to the Kingdom of Albion’s throne.  Dorothy: A gorgeous woman who uses her sex appeal to her advantage   Beatrice: A young girl who can change her voice as well as mimic others via a device on her throat!  With an amazing soundtrack as well as breathtaking visuals, what’s not to love?   If you’re a fan of steampunk, action, and drama, then this is definitely the anime for you. Please, do yourself a favor and watch it! The series as well as the movie is streaming on HIDIVE! I know this sounds like a shameless advertisement for the service, but it’s definitely worth it to watch the most underrated and visually stunning anime that is currently out there.   EDIT: Please join /r/princessprincipal if you’re further interested! There’s even a discord!",anime,nq90ue

If you have watched that, you know how badass sukuna is. I want to see more of that. Maybe this is rare, I don't know.

My dad is pretty critical of it and doesn’t really like the idea of me watching it. What are some good shows with little to no fanservice, solid themes, and without too much dark content?  Edit: So my dad goes a little over-the-top in his analysis of the spiritual aspects of tv shows and movies and thinks parts of anime are “evil”. It’s hard to watch it around him. He think the devil is trying to infiltrate pop culture and children through the media we watch. He’s not some crazy person just a great Christian guy who overanalyzes stuff sometimes.

"Anime: (College?) Aged boy falls in love with girl, some accident occurs, boy continually relives their last day together but has to give up something new every day.. finally ends when he is required to give up his (pet or..) cat? Hello! I had a flashback to an anime I saw on a flight once.. I believe based in Japan, a (college aged?) Student who has fallen in love with another student, ends up repeating his last day alive with her to keep the memory alive, but every new day has to give up something precious, suddenly ending with giving up his (pet or..) cat? In the end he refuses to do so, even though the film leads you to believe he will relive one more day, but you see he is absent and live goes on.  Any ideas?

"Interested in a twisted story and some premium Mindfuck? Then watch ""Kara no Kyoukai: The Garden of Sinners"". Do you ever feel like your average every day anime is too easy to follow? Well, I don't, but I still love me a show that challenges my attention and a little bit of my intelligence. Something that makes me go ""what the hell just happened?"" And believe me, while watching Kara no Kyoukai that sentence slipped my lips many times.   **Title:** Kara no Kyoukai: The Garden of Sinners  **Studio:** Ufotable  **Genre:** Mystery, Action, Thriller, Supernatural  **Release:** 2007 - 2008  **Length:** Seven Movies, duration varies from 45 minutes to 2 hours + one 30 minutes special  **MAL link:**   **Synopsis:** September 1998. The news are filled with a string of suicides, that have occurred over the past weeks. These seem unrelated at first, but when investigated on closer by a detective agency that specializes in supernatural cases, the similarities between these deaths become strikingly obvious. Touko Aozaki, Magus and head of the agency, sends out Shiki Ryougi and Mikiya Kokutou to find out the truth behind the case.    But before I start praising these Movies, I want to talk about who should NOT watch this.   **You likely won't enjoy the show if...**  ...you want some mindless fun. You'll need to pay a lot of attention to what is happening when watching this.   ...pretentiously deep dialogue puts you off. There's a lot of thoughtful stuff, but a lot is also kinda fake deep.  ...need everything explained. The concepts of the world are often expanded for the sake of the story without explanation.   ...are disturbed by graphic depiction of violence, rape and things like that. Kara no Kyoukai is very explicit when it comes to the disturbing stuff.   But now **What makes it so good?**   **The Atmosphere**  It starts dark and it stays dark. The atmosphere is very consistent and compelling throughout the story. Everything seems mysterious and shady, which is supported by art and sound. Mostly calm, sometimes dangerous, always immersive.  **The Mystery**  The slow pace of the movies works very much in favor of the story, which mostly revolves around different murder cases, related to some form of supernatural phenomenon. It has you constantly guessing what drives the person commiting these crimes and how it will all turn out in the end. There's a great deal of psychology involved and it's always presented in a fascinating way. The climax is almost always a fight and with ufotable animating it, you can imagine how goregeous they look.  **The Storytelling**  This is probably the strongest point. The story is arranged in a non-linear way, which is used to deepen the mystery around the characters and their backgrounds. This way, there's always a twist waiting and a surprise lurking. The story will catch you off guard over and over as again and mess with your mind. Events from previous movies will tie into the plot of others to make the whole story more and more interesting and complex. The peak of this is the fith Movie, where I had to pause multiple times and recap everything I had seen and learned in my mind to understand it. Malicious masterful mindfuck.  **The Antagonists**  Kara no Kyoukai is filled with a wide variety of villains. Interesting, scary, strong, smart... They're always different, but never boring or dull. They have motivations established which make them compelling and a driving factor in the mystery. And every time the climax arrives and everything involving them clears up, their arc is resolved in a satisfying way.  Lastly **The Soundtrack**  Do I need to say more than that it's done by Yuki Kajiyura? I can't stress enough how much the music adds to the atmosphere of every scene. Whether it's mysterious, suspenseful or emotional, the soundtrack always fits the tone perfectly.   **conclusion**  Are you in for an intense ride, filled with mystery, mindfuck and emotion? Kara no Kyoukai will give you what you're looking for.  ^also ^if ^you ^liked ^them ^check ^out ^my ^recommendation ^about ^Denpa ^teki ^na ^kanojo ^since ^it's ^quite ^similar",anime,i18rxl

Turns out she's a monster/dangerous being with powers who like did bad stuff and lost her memories of that and everyone around her is a paid actor and they are filing her for like a TV show or movie or something. I'm legit going crazy trying to find this, I don't even know if it was real at this point. Please help  THANK YOU SO MUCH GUYS it was blood c, y'all are my saviors so sorry for forgetting to flag for spoilers. I just re-watched it and my description of it here was a little off haha",anime,ii43o8
"I made a guide/list of anime for newcomers to this world. Often times, I've been asked by my friends for recommendations. Sometimes they're interested themselves and sometimes they're kept at the end of a loaded revolver (mostly by me) to try anime.    I made a small list of anime for them to check out. I kept in mind that they're newcomers and would probably be a little repulsed by fan service and would get confused by the cultural differences. I also avoided anime that are very long since they just want to check it out. The longest anime I added was Black Clover since it's pretty new and still ongoing. I'm new to this world myself, so I chose the ones that I've  watched and I know I missed alotttt of actual gems but I didn't want to add any shows that I haven't watched myself (steins; gate is my next watch I promise)   So, tell me your thoughts?  Link: [Guide](  Edit: So I've looked at the comments and realised I need to change a few things:  1)Watch FMAB asap and add it to the list   2)Add categories like Mystery, Drama, Ecchi, Sci-Fi and Sports  3)Shift Hyouka and Charlotte to Mystery and add actual thrillers like Code Geass to Thriller   Thank you everyone for your suggestions, I'll make sure to update with the changes.  If anyone has any other suggestions, leave a comment or write me a message and I'll be sure to reply. Unless I've answered it before.  Also, I was thinking of making some other list/chart as well. If anyone wants to collaborate, hit me up and we can brainstorm ideas.",anime,gp4nmn
"Erased, what an emotional thrill ride Was on funi looking for a new anime to watch and found erased. I gave the overview a quick look over and was hooked at recluse. Right up my alley. When revival was put into effect, I was more than intrigued as I'm a fan of steins gate, chaos head. When Satoru went all the way back to his childhood I knew it as about to get really good. Coz, who wouldn't want to go back to their childhood with what they know now?   The parts with Kayo really hit close to home for me and I was hoping for a happy turn out for her because Noone deserves that kind of childhood although not all of us were rescued from one. I really love how Satoru was able to open up and make new friends. His character development Imo was pretty good and I rather enjoyed the change in his character. The part where the killer revealed himself to Satoru was really good but I knew it was Mr Yashiro from the hints with candy, he gave Satoru and the mom home when he followed Aya from cram school. Th part of him being trapped in the car and awoke in a coma was really sad for me esp when it was revealed he lost his memories I thought oh no. When Satoru revealed to Mr Yashiro he did in fact remember everything then proceeding to wheel himself off the roof..I won't lie..I held my breath and gasped. I really thought Satoru was gone. Again, when Mr Yashiro let go of the chair. Ugh, my heart can't take anymore. I was captivated with Erased, the feels, the suspense, the characters, the plot. Everything about it was amazing for me and I'm glad I took the chance to give it a go. I too, am left with a need, a void to fill after finishing Erased. I'll watch the live adaption on Netflix and see if it satisfies my need for this anime.",anime,gkuayn
"Anime for 12 year old boy without fan service Hi! My brother is really wanting to watch anime. Unfortunately my parents (more specifically, my mom) have the view that majority of it is inappropriate for his age. I'm hoping to find some anime that doesn't have any fan service but still would be interesting for him, as fan service is the main thing i'm worried about my mom getting mad at him for.  My brother doesn't mind what genre it is and likes to watch it in sub. Swearing isn't an issue and minor gore should be fine.  Edit: List of anime he has seen My Hero Academia,   Little Witch Academia,  Aggretsuko,  Snow White with the Red Hair,  K-On,  Cardcaptor Sakura,   Bananya,  Sailor Moon,  After School Dice Club,  Kinos Journey    Also, thank you guys for all the suggestions thus far!!

"Cowboy Bebop is a must watch! I know it’s already well known and most of you have seen it but for those who haven’t, Cowboy Bebop is an incredible must watch. It’s got a great cast of characters from different backgrounds. It’s episodic with a gripping plot running alongside. Not to mention,the OST SLAPS and the 90s art style is a breather from the copy and paste character designs nowadays. Lastly, it has the BEST dub I’ve heard thus far- the voice actors did an amazing job relaying tones and nuances (especially with Spike). I just finished it and I feel empty - the show doesn’t lie when it says “you’ll be carrying that weight.”",anime,gyw9zo

"My (slightly salty) Guide to Romance Anime We have all been there... You finish watching an absolute masterpiece of a romance anime and the gaping void in your soul gets ever wider. You scour anime forums and trawl through MAL hoping, praying you come across the next romance anime that will fill that void. You watch romcom trash after trash only to see no romance develop and the same old tropes get played over and over again, until eventually, you find that one anime that temporarily fills the void again. Well folks look no further, here is a very finite list of romance anime that will feed that ever growing void!   I have never shared my thoughts before but after seeing the same old garbage recommendations people make for romance anime time and time again, I thought it was time to share my incredibly biased (but correct) opinion ;)  The following anime provide actual romance progression (something that is more than a possible confession at ep 25...) and a change from the normal tropes you see in every god damn romcom. Bar some, I have tried to list some anime that don't get recommended as often.  If you have already seen all these anime then maybe recommend me something instead :D, and if you think I have bad taste then you're obviously wrong.      School Romance:  Tsuki Ga Kirei - Probably the most relatable elementary school romance I've seen. 100% will also give you diabetes.  Kids on the Slope - Fantastic highschool romance with emphasis on drama and music (you like jazz?). I rarely see this absolute gem recommended which saddens me. I can't recommend this more!  Beastars - Don't judge a book by its cover. It may look like furry bait, but it isn't and it has superb romance and drama. While it is CG, its CG is by Studio Orange so it actually looks quite good. Even if you don't like the CG, the quality of the writing makes up for it 10 fold.   Clannad/Clannad: After Story - Very slow burn romance. I wasn't much of a fan of the first season (due to its slow pacing and tropes I have seen a million times), but my lord the second season is a masterpiece and will have you crying unless you have a heart of stone. The second season is also set after school. This is the only anime I've seen that covers the entirety of a romance between a couple - school life, post school life, jobs, living together, family, etc etc.  Tsurezure Children - a collection of mini romance stories. Leans more on the comedy side and can be adorable at times.  &#x200B;  Post School Romance:  Golden Time: Wanna watch the MC absolutely DESTROY the friendzone? Then go no further. Set in college and is a good mixture of comedy and drama. It has its issues at times (\*cough\* ghost Banri \*cough\*) but something about the charm and progression of this show made up for its issues.  Nana - want something a bit more mature? Then Nana is for you. This anime is a long watch (50eps) but is well worth your time. This anime (along side Tsuki ga Kirei) is one of the more realistic romances I've watched. It follows a band so be prepared for a dash of music too!  &#x200B;  Movies (If you haven't already seen these then sort out your priorities...):  Koe no Katachi  Kimi no Na wa  Byousoku 5 Centimeter  &#x200B;  If your after a romance that is spicy, and i mean Ghost Pepper spicy, then may i recommend these:  Kuzu no Honkai  Domestic Girlfriend  &#x200B;  There are a few more I want to mention but to save this from dragging out any further I'll leave it here.",anime,goh7hw
"anime that help you cope with grief (especially with the cause of suicide) Hello! Thought I might start this topic on here, since there are a few series, movies and games that helped me coping with my situation.  EDIT: I am a little bit overwhelmed by the amount of comments this post got, but I am slowly going to go through the recommendations and will add them to this list!  **TW: suicide, hanging, alcohol, death**, I hope it's alright to describe my experience in a few sentences, if not just let me know and I will remove it ASAP.  **my experience**: last year I had to experience the death of my grandpa through hanging. that hit me especially hard due to the fact he was pretty much my father, because I didnt have contact to my real father my entire life. also finding him made me develop posttraumatic stress disorder which makes my everyday life even more complicated. this year, my mom who has had schizophrenia, died because she kept drinking so much alcohol that her organs stopped working entirely. I assume my grandpa's mental health was strongly connected to my mom's mental and physical state, while my mom's state got especially worse after my grandpa, her father, died. I know this all sounds kind of made up because it's too many events occuring at once, but I just feel so awful.  which is why I thought about starting this thread in order to find media, especially anime, that might help with coping. they don't exactly have to overlap with the theme of suicide, but I feel that it helps quite a bit with feeling ""understood"" considering the very specific kind of emotions like e.g. guilt that it sadly evokes.  here is what I found during the last year, that helped me with **grief**, **trauma** and as a **suicide survivor**:  \> **Neon Genesis Evangelion** (1995)  While NGE might be an obvious and also very popular example, to me who watched it for the first time in 2020, it was extremely helpful. a lot of the characters experience trauma and grief connected to the death of their loved ones. overall the anime helped me finding a new perspective and gave me the overall message that despite how bad things might be, I would still be able to turn my life into a ""better"" direction.  \> **Given** (2019)  Most people would connect Given to the BL genre, but to me it was more about the grief of dealing with your loved one's suicide than it was about its BL aspects. When I started watching Given I absolutely did not expect it to deal with topics such as grief, trauma or suicide at all, so I was positively suprised that it actually made me help processing what I experienced. the lyrics hit me real hard. the anime left me with a rather hopeful, positive view that despite of what happened, things would still get better.  \> **Wonder Egg Priority** (2021)  I know a lot of people criticize WEP especially for how it ended, and I was a little bit disappointed by that as well. But considering there aren't TOO many (or at least not many I know about) anime that deal with the topic of a beloved person's suicide, I still keep this series in my mind very positively. I personally think that even despite its flaws, you might be able to get your own conclusion or maybe a useful message while watching these girls trying to get their loved ones back.  \> **A place further than the universe** (2018)  I do not think grief was the main theme but it was still very realistic catching a character's feelings about her mom's death.  \> **Persona 5** (game)  For Persona 5 I don't really recommend the anime adaptation except you've finished the game and want to see more of Akechi.  In the game, one character's situation seems to be pretty much similar to mine, especially with the guilt caused by suicide. there is another character whose friend attempted suicide and another one whose mother has died. these aspects were pretty relatable to me, yet they remained hopeful.  also the game is really good at handing you the message of being able to choose your own fate, meaning that, at least many times, you are not completely lost even if the situation might seem that way.  \> **ReLIFE** (2016)  The anime is also about trying to give people who feel that they have failed in life a new perspective. One of the characters shows symptoms of trauma about a loved one's suicide.  \---------------------------------------------------------------------  **additions**:  \> **Fruits Basket** (2001/2019)  I only watched the first season of the remake so far, but as *fedebi* (thanks again!) said, it deals a lot with self-acceptance and self-forgiving. In my opinion the protagonist's hopeful attitude also does a good job with keeping a positive view in life. It also carries a good message of trying to keep your lost loved ones in good memories as she reminisces a lot about her mom.  \> **My roommate is a cat** (2019)  As *SynthismS* (thanks for suggesting!) put it, the anime is about coping with your parent's death (not suicide related), which makes the protagonist become depressed and a bit of a shut-in as a result of this experience. Over the series he slowly starts to come out of his shell and find moments of happiness again with the help of his supportive friends and a cat that he adopts and slowly learns to come to terms with his grief.  \> **AnoHana** (2011)  AnoHana also being a very popular example, portrays a friends group that tries to come to terms with the death of one of their beloved childhood friends. The protagonist often sees her ""ghost"" as he keeps thinking about her even years after her death. I personally watched this one way back in 2011, before I've made my own experience with death. But I think what makes this anime so popular might be the fact that it leaves a huge impression that just stays - especially for its last episode. Thanks to *akai\_squishy* for suggesting!  \> **To your Eternity** (2021)  Now this is a tricky one since it's still airing, but the story is about an immortal being that slowly learns to be human while adapting their behaviour and emotions. It truly has a beautiful and unique approach to death, grief and the value of life. The story is extremely emotional but in a good way. Thanks to *HazelNike* for suggesting!  \> **Violet Evergarden** (2017)  The anime was really good at presenting the raw, immediate grief right after you learn about your loved one's death. It's an extremely emotional show, I personally had to take several breaks while watching even before I had a personal connection with loss and death. Thanks to *Hi\_Im\_Ouiji* for recommending!  \> **Death Parade** (2016)  It's been really long since I watched this anime, but as *Bla5terjx* (thanks again!) said, it teaches you a lot about the value of life and deals with the impact of suicide.  \> **Orange** (2015)  I personally didn't resonate too much with the anime, and I can't really put into words why. But I can see that for some people the anime might be very helpful as it deals with the topics of suicide and grief! maybe this will be helpful to someone out there. big thanks to *abunonicrat*!  \> **Vinland Saga** (2019)  I personally watched this show before I had to experience all this grief, but iirc the protagonist had to deal with a deep grief and wish for revenge connected to the death. (big thanks to *Centex\_*!)  \> **A Silent Voice** (2016)  The movie's focus was a little more on feeling suicidal and trying to prevent someone from doing it, but it overall tries to leave you with a hopeful message as well. (huge thanks to *Centex\_* as well!)  \-------------------------------------------------------  so yeah, this is what I've gathered so far. If I come across different media that help with coping I might add them to this list!  the focus should be on really helping you cope, so just anime that contain a suicide scene as a shock element without any helpful or meaningful message doesn't quite fit into the topic, in my opinion.  If you guys have any additions to this list, I would be thankful and add them to my existing list as well!  Do you guys have anything that helped you cope with a loved one's death?  Thank you very much!  edit: I just read that the *Watch this!* flair was not intended to post huge lists but I hope this list will be fine due to its purpose of helping other people in a similar situation.",anime,nz5ym5

"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions! is easily the best romcom I've seen, but not because of the romance or the comedy. (Sorry, Kaguya-sama.)  For those of you who haven't heard of it, the anime is about a first year high schooler, Yuuta, who wants to restart at a new school to avoid embarrassment due to his previous chunibyo (a ""disease"" which causes middle schoolers to have delusions that they are superheroes). That's all going well, until he meets Rikka, another first year high schooler who 1) also has chunibyo and 2) also thinks Yuuta has a power. (I've only seen Season 1 and the OVA, but I felt the need to make this.)  As much as I love the comedy and romance in this, that's not why it stands out. KyoAni made this gem, and as a result its filled with beautiful animation, music and character design at each and every scene.   In addition, there's also a lot of drama in this anime. As the show progresses, you understand Rikka better while understanding Yuuta's relationship with her too. The story itself shows more underneath everything else as it goes on, and by the end, I was touched.  Definitely watch it if you're after a slice-of-life romcom with great story, characters, animation and music.  [Here's]( d) the link to it's MAL.",anime,hfi55y

I'd love to see a good romance comedy anime that has a realistic view of life where the people find that they are in love and kiss, hold hands, and don't see sex as this insanely inhumane act.  Shows like: - death March to a parallel world (he went to at least three brothels and I loved it) - domestic girlfriend (hilarious and great show) - pet girl of Sakura hall (the other dude was a Chad) - shimoneta (I know this doesn't fit the description but any show that says the words ""love nectar"" and has scenes like those is just hilarious, and what in looking for) - grisaia",anime,g97tas

"Do you like sci-fi? Are you interested in philosophy? Do you want to cry? Then watch Texhnolyze! ###Introduction  Deep below the ground, in a dull, gray place lies a city  called Lux. If you seek happiness, do not visit this place, for it holds nothing but pure, raw humanity. This city is the farthest from perfect that one could imagine; not much more than a landscape of ruins is left of it. But at the same time, the people that live here are filled with a strong will to survive and push forward another day. Because they have hope. They have hope that one day, something will change for the better.   ###Basic Information  **Title:** Texhnolyze (spoken Technolyze)  **Genre:** sci-fi, psychological, drama  **Duration:** 22 episodes  **Studio:** Madhouse  **Aired:** 2003  [MAL Page](  [Anilist Page](   ###Why You Should Watch It   **A World Full Of Life**  There are three groups in Lux that are relevant in the beginning.  There's the Organo, that essentially controls the city, Rakan, that mostly seek some power for personal gain and the Salvation Union, that battles against the ideals of both Rakan and the Organo. There's also other groups like The Class, Gabe and The Surface, but those only get brought up later. And of course, there's people acting on their own. So in short, there's always something going on in Lux.  The beauty is, that the story is told from a multitude of perspectives, which allows us to experience and great deal of what's going on. For example, while the Organo deals with one problem, Rakan might be doing something completely unrelated. And then there's also things happening that you don't even get to see, because they don't happen around any of the major characters. The world simply moves forward, whether the characters take part in it or not. This makes Lux feel truly real and alive and it's one of the best things about the show.   Another good point is that the shifts between the characters happen completely natural. A sequence of episodes can be mostly focused on two characters and then the episodes after that can focus on someone completely different. And it's done in a way you don't even realize how the focus shifts. It just... happens.   **An Uphill Journey**  Texhnolyze doesn't have the strongest start. I don't mean to say it isn't good, it is, but it simply keeps getting better and better. There's a twist happening around episode 7, which is the point where the story really rises in quality and then there's the last four episodes that are almost perfect. The start isn't bad, but the series rises from like a 7/10 to a 9/10 over the cause of the 22 episodes. That's because the way Texhnolyze is written is that it's all bulding up towards a big climax, which puts the events of previous episodes into perspective. There are a lot of high points in between though, so don't worry, you won't have to wait for the last four episodes to get a great show.   **Soul and Body, Perfection and Imperfection**  Texhnolyze is a heady show to say the least. Not only is story complex requires you to keep up, but the philosophy that is portrayed is not as simple as ""friendship is everything"" or ""you can do it if you believe in it"". There's no such thing as simplicity when it comes to Texhnolyze, especially not when it comes to its themes. It questions the most basic human behavior or the meaning of life and death among other things. And as much as these topics have been discussed in the past, the view that Texhnolyze presents is truly a unique and interesting one. I won't say more though, because that would spoil it.   ###Conclusion  Texhnolyze is a show that might not be for everyone. However, if you enjoy heady sci-fi, atmospheric thriller or psychological pieces then I whole heartedly believe that you will like it.   Thanks for reading  P.s. [The Opening]( immediately became one of my favorites.",anime,n2cnub

It's full of fan service, cliffhangers that will never be resolved, and so on.   I'm looking to give anime another shot, to redeem it in my eyes, but I have some specific things I'm looking for and I hope you guys can help me find something worth my time. Here's everything I'm hoping for:  1. It absolutely has to have an ending. My biggest issue with the industry is all of the shows left with 12, give or take, episodes and no real satisfying conclusion. I've been told this is partly, at least, a marketing ploy to get more people reading the manga. However, I don't really enjoy manga, comic books, or graphic novels so that's useless for me.   2. If two characters are set up to have a romantic relationship, I want to see that relationship go to its natural conclusion, whatever that conclusion may be. I personally feel that I've seen more shows than I care to count where the MC has a clearly defined core love interest, but that relationship is never actualy explored, and instead more and more female characters are introduced to form a pseudo-harem, even when the show isn't necessarily ecchi. It's just annoying.  Side note: I'm cool with adult themes, any genre, and even fan service as long as it meets the first 2 requirements. It can be a sports anime, action, mecha, whatever.   3. This one is optional but I'd like if it was streaming on prime, Netflix, or hulu. It just makes my life easier, but life I said, if it's not on any of these it's still worth recommending. I'll make it work.  So thanks in advance, my tone probably sounded like I'm very soured on anime and honestly I kind of am, but that's why I'm here trying to find something that will bring me back in.  Edit: Holy hell this blew up,  thanks for all the responses. I'll try and start with the most frequently recommended ones.  edit 2: Alright, I've put together my initial list (some I've never heard of and am VERY interested in) and once I work through these I'll refer back to this post for more. Thanks a lot, guys!",anime,i9vcv2
"Looking for something with the same type of humor as kaguya-sama As the title says. Would be cool if it was a romance too, but the humor is really what I’m looking for. Nothing I’ve seen has come close to making me laugh that hard.",anime,l5ywb4
Anime where the MC develops an unexpected romantic relationship with a side character like Hana and Kiyoshi from prison school. Title.

"Naruto may possibly be the most ""meh"" anime i've ever seen I started watching Naruto at the start of lockdown and I will tell you Naruto really isn't worth it IMO if you have got something else to watch. Excluding filler which takes up 300 episodes out of almost 700 episodes which I didn't watch, every episode is dragged onto a ridiculous amount to the point I found myself looking at my phone and skipping parts in an episode because of how boring watching the characters stare at each other were. this may be a rant but let me say why I'm so annoyed after finishing it last night.  The hype people say it was couldn't of been any more wrong. I was watching it waiting for the ""big twist"" or the ""hype it will live up to"" that while watching it i could only give a fraction of the satisfaction I should of been able to. I loved watching Naruto's growth and I loved \*some\* fights with very strong connotations but it wasn't worth it at all after.  The story was also going in circles. I hated the idea of after episode 350 to 480 it was the same fight and every time you thought the enemy was defeated or it was over they came back with something else that makes sense but gave no enjoyment because it was so repetitive having the villain beat by the protagonist doing something repeated 5x over.  Spoiler for the next part:  >!Sasuke and Sakura are possibly the worst side characters I've ever seen. Yes they had some redemption parts but for Sasuke it was a constant ""I'll kill you"" to the bitter end and with sakura it was ""Sasuke i don't care if its mass genocide i'm down for it because i love you"" or some bullshit!<  To top it off Boruto was rubbing salt in the wound to the ending Shippuden had which I'm still salty about. Boruto is a blatant rip off and rehash of the entirety of Naruto. I could be totally wrong but im 2 episodes in and it just looks exactly how Naruto started and played out just with a couple twist to the world building and Boruto himself. >!I can already tell Boruto has some secret power that he has to use  or overcome in order to stop the apocalypse or something.!<  There we go rant over, say what you want this is my honest opinion of Naruto and i understand it's not entirely the shows fault, its also the fan base but i'm still pretty irritated about it all.  Edit: I have to say, thru the comments and the past couple of days I’ve changed my meh opinion to an alright, I was pretty salty about the ending but it’s still alright and I recommend watching it ONLY if you have absolutely nothing else and I recommend you read the manga instead through what the comments have said  A common question is my favourite anime, I really like hxh, aot, fmab, mha, opm, mob psycho. These have great animation, story and are usually binge worthy.  Just as something you may like to know, my favourite arc and my top 10 arcs is probably the pain arc  Edit 2: I tried replying to as many as I can but there’s quite a lot lmao  Edit 3: for anyone still looking, it’s for some reason in my head reached a decent to pretty good level instead of meh and alright as I’ve got over the fillers and now can only remember the story as a flash and I realise it’s potential was great",anime,i3lm9j
"ecchi with no harem I honestly don't even care if its a \[DATA EXPUNGED\] at this point because for some reason this tiny simple thing seems so impossible for any writer to get. I started watching The Testament of Sister New Devil and thought it was perfect, and then that little blue haired bitch just had to come in in the second episode and ruined the entire fucking series for me. Like can you have a single monogamous relationship at this point? I'm legitimately malding so hard right now because for some reason these writers just hate ethical relationships where both parties enjoy it. Do they actually think those girls enjoy having to fight  four other girls over this guy who is so fucking indecisive and then everyone cheers when theres a 'true harem ending'. They'll never be able to live their lives in peace knowing that some other girl could become favored by the person they love. Like switch it around if you really like this girl but so do 6 other guys and she ends up taking them all in would you really fucking like that??? Do you not just want to have a simple loving relationship with the person you love without trying to compete with all these other assholes?????? sorry for getting so worked up i just havent been able to find anything that i actually enjoy watching lately and its pissing me the fuck off",anime,keyevu

"LPT: Use MAL and read reviews! (Rant) I'm getting tired of all the recent posts being: Is (insert high-score and famous anime) any good? Is (insert high-score and famous anime) worth it?   If you just type it into MAL there is a score by thousands of viewers and usually hundreds of reviews from people who've watched it. What's the point of asking here other than gain attention because of course anyone that has seen these shows will tell you a variation of: yeah, definitely you should.  I came to this subreddit because I've seen some pretty good suggestions on shows I've never heard of. Now all that is in my feed are people asking about the top 50 anime on MAL which everyone can find easily.  Anyway, that's about it. I would just like you to have a look at the MAL database and try to make this sub revolve around more than just the top 50 shows.   Peace",anime,g6j8ev
"What are some eat-friendly anime? And I'm not talking about food-related anime, but rather anime you can watch that you can ALWAYS rely on being enjoyable- without any disgusting scenes- and goes well with your food.  Examples of incompatability would be ""Gintama"", with all of its... toilet humor, and ""Hunter x Hunter"" during the chimera ant arc.  I find shonen anime like Naruto, while good, is too long for a lot of episodes to feel ""special"" while you're eating.  Examples of **complete food compatibility** would be ""Mushoku Tensei"", ""Demon Slayer"", ""Bakemonogatari"", and, ""Arakawa Under the bridge"" kinda.  Anyone know what I mean?",anime,lg2dk0
"Anime that gets progressively surreal like evangelion The last two episodes of evangelion really fucked me up, haven't seen anything this surreal since David Lynch movies.  Reminds me of this:  (No spoilers)  I don't want anything absurd, bizarre or just ""weird"". Something surreal like these two last episodes of Evangelion that is filled with symbolism about religion, psychology and deep meaning that makes you question a lot of things and apply your own interpretations.  Closest thing I can think of is Bakemonogatari, Kaiba, Re:Zero, Mawaru Penguindrum, Perfect Blue  Bonus points if it gets progressively surreal like Evangelion and Re:Zero (They start off like typical shounen for several episodes with very little cliffhangers, then shit gets unreal out of nowhere and you are left baffled each progressing episode)",anime,iwazae

"Gurren Lagann is insanely good This show is one of the most unique shows I’ve ever watched. It’s like if kill la kill and fooly cooly had a baby that was born with the ability to salsa dance. Not sure if thats a good description  of it or if it even fits what Im trying to say, but dam did this show surpass all my expectations.  Everyone has probably seen Gurren Lagann or at least heard of it, but this is for those who have been keeping this gem on their ptw list for a long time. If your a fan of anime you owe it to yourself to watch Gurren Lagann at some point in time. It’s most definitely deserving of its MAL score and that’s a fact.  The characters, the world building, the soundtracks, and the story are all equally fantastic. There is simply no reason not to like Gurren Lagann. I’d go even as far to say that people who generally don’t like mecha would even enjoy it. There’s never a dull moment in this show and that’s one of its strong suits.  “Who the hell do you think I am”   Oh and it’s 3am where I’m at and I just finished the show after binging the whole series in one sitting. So I guess I might be a little generous but honestly a 10/10 from me",anime,glb0nk
Charlotte was great I know a large majority of people disliked the last three episodes or so but I personally didn’t mind it.

In the end every action that group makes weighs in the story, like the increase in debt, getting a house the defeat of generals in every season, this leading up to the battle with the demon king (being my speculation).   Yes moments can be a bit action packed, buts its not attack on titan levels of action and despair.

"Cute shows that develop dark and heavy themes So, I just was thinking about Made in Abyss, and I realized, I don't know any other shows like it. There's stuff like Madoka Magica, but, it's really not the same. Madoka Magica is relatively fast paced, and starts hitting heavy relatively soon. It was always dramatic, and never gave you a rest. I'm not looking for that.  What I really liked about Made in Abyss, was that it retained a lot of it's peacefulness and still had a lot of Slice of Life type atmosphere even when it was getting dark and heavy. It also gradually got dark, and didn't just throw you right in there with one big reveal.  Also, I know there's some cute shows that pretend to be dark and heavy, but no characters ever actually die, and they never truly cross the line into that territory. I'm not really looking for these kinds of shows, but I guess they would work if there's nothing else.  Edit: before this get's out of hand, I'm looking for shows that have mostly female main characters, and start out with a more slice of life kind of feel. Made in abyss was right at that edge, with cute characters mostly having discussions and showing a lot of naïve excitement, and never really venturing too deep at first. I'm not simply looking for shows that are lighthearted, they need to have a touch of that CGDCT atmosphere.  And I'm ideally looking for stuff that gets dark enough where main characters end up dying, but I left the idea of dark and heavy vague because it doesn't matter as much as the initial atmosphere of the show.",anime,mtiign

"Why you should try Cells At Work Code Black Lately there has been a rise in self-care in all types of mediums. People have realized it’s time to take better care of their bodies. Hell, there are even cartoons showing off the inner workings of your body such as Osmosis Jones.   However, would you believe there is an anime version of Osmosis jones as well? Yes folks, last year Cells at work took the internet by storm, by entertaining millions of weebs while informing why they should take care of their bodies; unless they want the cute pallets, hot milf macrophages and millions of hard-working cells to suffer!   However, this season its edgy sibling has arrived to break the internet once again, this time bringing tears all around rather than joy. As we are shamed for our poor habits, witnessing our poor cells die tirelessly working 24/7 to keep our bodies alive.    And that anime is ***CELLS AT WORK BLACK!   *** If you enjoyed the original cells at work then this version should be a must watch, unless you can’t stomach (terrible pun, I know) watching millions of innocent cells suffer.   However, I’m mainly addressing the ***newcomers here.***       Cells at work black is an educational anime, that showcases the inner workings of the bodies; displaying the life of millions of cells, showing off how they help keep our body running. It’s not just random nonsense coming from the authors ass, these shows have been credited by official doctors as being mainly accurate!   So, if any of you are looking for assistance in your medical classes, don’t shy away from this anime.   However, the show is not only about informing you how much your eating habits suck, no it’s actually GENUINALLY entertaining!    Cells at work black has a ton of badass characters that fight in life and death situations vs millions of terrifying germs. We got the sexy badass white blood cells, the masculine T-killer cells, the yandare milf macrophages!   ***They all engage in epic battles against dbz like bacteria.*** And when I say Dbz like I mean it! Just look at their designs, they look like your average dragon ball villain lol!    They range in form, from cell knock offs, to horrifying zombielike cancer cells. However, the cancer cell has only been covered in the vanilla version so far, but I'm positive code black will most definitely have its own terrifying cancer enemy!       However, remember cells at work black is the ***DARK version of cells at work!*** There are no cute happy pallets, no charming sol moments, just a whole bunch of suffering...      In this anime, we follow a male red blood cell rather than his female predecessor, and almost every cell has been genderbended, so for you horny weebs out there, you may have a hidden gem over here.      At first everything seems all cheery, the red blood cells are casually chilling in class, learning about how to be an efficient blood cell. Until they get sent out to the workforce, and their innocence is immediately shaken to its core. As they realize what hellscape, they just walked into.

"I Recommend Watching ""Erased"". Genre: Supernatural, Psychological, Seinen Synopsis: Struggling manga author Satoru Fujinuma is beset by his fear to express himself. However, he has a supernatural ability of being forced to prevent deaths and catastrophes by being sent back in time before the incident occurred, repeating time until the accident is prevented. One day, he gets involved in an accident that has him framed as a murderer. Desperate to save the victim, he sends himself back in time only to find himself as a grade-schooler one month before fellow classmate Kayo Hinazuki went missing. Satoru now embarks on a new quest: to save Kayo and solve the mystery behind her disappearance.  Thoughts/Comments: I personally liked this anime due to it being ""well balanced"" the plot is amazing but even though it has murder it is not gory? and it even has comedy, I was amazed at how they made a lot of thought into creating this, It was indeed a top for me when it comes to Psychological/Supernatural Genre. I highly recommend this, It may be boring and cruel at first, but don't be dismayed as further episodes will come to thoroughly explain and develop the story.",anime,gn4bxd
"Got back into anime after 7 years...what should I watch? I was pretty into anime for a while back in like 2010, but I really fell off after 2014 as TV shows on Netflix and HBO started to get particularly good. I always had a soft spot for Neon Genesis Evangelion, and happened to rewatch it a couple of months ago and it sparked my interest in anime again. I held off for a little while but just this past week I rewatched Steins;Gate (because I loved it the first time) and I'm fully onboard again. So now I need some recommendations!  I remembered also loving Death Note, Code Geass, Clannad, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Attack of Titan (only season 1), Hunter X Hunter 2011 (never finished because I caught up to live), Elfen Lied, Cowboy Bebop and Yu Yu Hakusho, just to name a few.

"Please suggest good anime about women where girls/women are real people (and aren’t just a fan service with a cute voice)! Like the title said I’m looking for anime that can take female characters and make them interesting without using chest and crotch shots! I have nothing against anime like that, but I think that there should also be good anime about women without them and those are few and far between. The fan service really ruins it for me, even with cool plots, like Fire Force! I thought it was really interesting but there is so much poorly placed and excessive fan service that I couldn’t continue (Just my opinion but really? Accidental lewdness?)  I am especially looking for sports anime! There are so many great men’s sports anime with friendship and character growth, like Running with the Wind (I especially recommend this if you are looking for new sports anime), Yuri on Ice and Haikyuu, but I have yet to see any about women that don’t also objectify or boil then down to a stereotype or the perfect waifu. It would be great to find an inspirational anime about women that actually respects the women it portrays as people.   Open to other genres, like comedy, slice of life, iyashikei, romance, etc... anything but horror (I can’t handle it -w-). Also open to manga since I know that anime narrows the field quite a bit.  Thanks in advance for suggestions, sorry that the post is so long, I’ve just gotten tired of finding something good only to discover that all the girls in it are portrayed as stupid with no personality beyond their looks.

"Recommend me some anime that doesn't (overly) sexualize teenage girls The older I get, the less I can stand how a huge majority of anime seems to treat high school (and younger!) girls. I'm looking for anime of any genre that doesn't do a bunch of upskirt shots of high school aged kids. This has proven shockingly hard to find. Even things people recommend me that are supposedly not like this have it in spades. For example I tried to watch Vision of Escaflowne and the protag gets her skirt pulled off in the first episode...  I'm totally fine with sexy stuff if the characters are NOT in high school. Gore/violence, just fine. I just don't want to have to look at high schooler's ass to enjoy a show. This is well and good for high school audiences but I don't want to feel like a 26 year old creep watching this shit.  Examples of shows I've enjoyed that don't sexualize kids:  \-.hack//SIGN  \-Ping Pong  \-Dirty Pair (They're 19 but that's juuuust acceptable)  \-Ghibli stuff  \-The Girl Who Leapt Through Time  \-Metropolis  You can recommend anime in ANY genre for any demographic.

"Hi! Does somebody know this anime? **FOUND:  is** [**This Boy Can Fight Aliens**](      Thanks to all!     The plot was more or less like this, the main character lives in the house of some guys, his friend, and a ""sensei"", the main character's memory is erased and all he has to remember his past life is a cell phone that is useless, he also fights monsters that appear only in the sensei's courtyard, at a specific time. After fighting he goes under the tree in the courtyard and eats some rice balls with the friend, all inside the white fence because I think sensei wouldn't let him out of there for some reason.  I remember almost nothing of the development, only that at some point he runs away from home at night because of his identity crisis, because he thinks his family doesn't care to know where he is or if he's okay, and that's why he never gets any messages from his family on his phone.  In the end, sensei manages to fix the phone by saying something like ""How do you expect messages to come to you if you haven't paid the phone bill?"" and he starts getting lots of messages, photos and videos from people all over Japan thanking him for defeating those monsters. Although he never gets a message from his real family, he is happy for the support of the people and the sensei and his friend, saying that this is his new family and he is staying with them.  Highly relatable images of how I remember the anime being visual.  * [Image 1]( The courtyard where the MC and friend ate rice balls and slept together. * [Image 2:]( house, one of those Japanese houses with sliding doors. * [Image 3:]( and how the main character fought. * [Image 4:]( gives his phone to the MC and the MC cries with happiness.  **Note:**  \-Everyone, both the MC, the friend and the sensei were male.  \- The monsters were designed in a different style and very detailed.  \- The anime is not Mirai Nikki, Wonder egg priority, Merman in my tub, Kill a kill nor Madoka Magica, but they are similar to this one.

"Steins Gate Review Stein’s Gate Review  When we think about anime masterpieces, there are some animes that automatically comes to mind: Psycho-Pass, Cowboy Bebop, Naruto, One Punch Man, Haikyuu!!, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Monster, Code Geass. But in 2011, White Fox Studios bring us what I think is the best anime of the last decade and also, my favorite anime: Steins;Gate. Based on the 2009 visual novel of the same name; Steins;Gate is a thrilling science fiction anime about time traveling that can be considered one of the best time traveling shows out there, but is not for everyone, I think that is the best thing about this anime; if you aren’t patient, this anime is not for you…  I have always been a fan of time traveling stories since I remember, everybody including myself wants to travel to the past to change something for better, but this may bring some bad consequences to the future; movies like Back to the Future and TV shows like Dark showed us these results, and Steins;Gate also shows us some of the consequences of time traveling. So, if you are also a fan of this subject, this anime is most definitely for you. Ok, so the plot goes like this: Set in 2010 in Akihabara, Japan, and follows Rintaro Okabe, a self-proclaimed “mad scientist”. He runs a mini laboratory with his friends Mayuri Shiina and Itaru “Daru” Dashida. While attending a conference about time traveling, he founds the dead body of scientist Kurisu Makise and sends a text message to Daru about it, and later he founds Kurisu alive and well, and that the message arrived before he sent it. They discover that the cell-operated microwave that they created can send text messages to the past, called “D-mails” and later, Kurisu creates a device that can send memories through the over, allowing the user to time travel.  I went into the anime thinking it would be hot-cliched garbage. The plot may sound cliché but honestly is very well written and unique, it has its flaws, is not perfect; the pacing of the first half of the history is very slow, this is why I said that this anime is not for everyone; you may want to drop the anime before the 5th episode if you are inpatient but after the 9th episode the story gets addictive and thrilling. The real thing starts in the 12th episode, that’s when the downward spiral of madness and stress begins, and the pace becomes tragically faster without losing the main plot. The plot twists start appearing while we are just begging for more answers for our questions… This is just awesome. Every character in the show is great and they are well known in the anime culture; Kurisu is considered a fan favorite “waifu”, Mayurii is also well known for her “Tuturuu” and the protagonist, Rintaro Okabe, is by far, my favorite anime protagonist ever. In the beginning you think that he is just crazy and cringy and schizophrenic but as the story progresses, he becomes someone reliable who will do everything for the sake of his friends. Every character in this show is unique, each character brings something very important to the story of this anime.  The animation is great and original, despite the anime is from 2011, the animation stands to this day and is still unique. It adapts well the dark tones from the visual novel, and it has influences from other anime like Serial Experiments Lain and Ergo Proxy, two psychological animes that are very interesting and haunting that have influenced a lot of other shows. The opening song: “Hacking to the Gate” is one of the best anime openings and has quite a relevance to the show.  The world of Steins;Gate contains a lot of references to real world people and subjects; things like Pringles, Dr. Pepper, Google, UNIQLO, CERN appear in the anime, obviously with the name slightly altered because of obvious reasons; do you remember John Titor? The legendary blogger that in 2000 he claimed to be a real-life time traveler. Well, he appears in the anime. You know an anime is really good when it uses a bunch of real-life references, it makes you know that they really wanted to create a unique history. To be honest, this anime set a bar for me, I’m not going to go bananas and say that this anime is the Casablanca of anime… But is it one of the best anime ever made? Hell yeah, it is. This anime is something you can’t ignore; it is something that a true person of culture must watch. I always recommend this anime to my friends and other people who ask for recommendations, because I know this anime is life changing. It also has a movie and a sequel called Steins;Gate 0 which is also okay but lackluster. It's not awful but it's not great either. It is mediocre, and they could have done a much better job while adapting the routes, even though stitched together like that it was kind of inevitable. The VN is superior indeed at this point. Fluid scenes seem stiff and scenes without action seem entirely bland.  Steins: Gate for me, only has one flaw… It has an end. I think they should have prolonged it but they ended it at quite a significant event. Stein’s Gate 0 is a kind of continuation, just a boring one. Although in 0, we got to see another side of Mayuri and Daru and some psychological effects as well but 0 will never hold a candle to the original 2011 Stein’s Gate.  It only loses a star from me due to its pacing. Its not that the first episodes are interesting or hooking, but it doesn’t hold a candle to the suspense and the descent into madness of the second half. It takes quite a lot of time for the story to set up but I appreciate that since it sets the rules for the world and the mechanics. Some people don’t like this, especially now, in the modern world, when all the people wants the story to progress in an hour. I enjoyed this because it set up the characters properly. We got to see comedy, action, physiological effects and emotions.  All in all, I loved this anime. It’s one of the best. I am rating this anime a 9/10.     Please tell me your suggestions for my review and what you liked/dislike about it in the reddit comments.",anime,nvqv7j

"well known, really ? (Monogatari series) Short presentation but I recommend to read cause the anime is more than that :   Monogatari is known. It's not that unpopular. But it's that type of anime that (in my circle of friends) everyone knows about but nobody saw. Then I saw it. It hits different. But I will take the pure sense of DIFFERENT.   Monogatari is about Koyomi Araragi, a teenager who helps girls with their problems, more or less extraordinary. This basic explanation isn't turning one anyone here.  I sell you here what I call ""my fav anime by far"". Cause Monogatari is all about characters and dialogues. It has the best-written characters I've ever seen in an anime. It's not a shounen, and I wouldn't say it's a seinen thought. It has very few fight scenes, and it has dialogues. A lot. But the best ones. Now that I have your attention, let's start the big presentation. (You can go watch the anime anytime by now)   WATCH ORDER: the Monogatari series has a very specific watch-order, I won't be annoying with it, I will just let you a link to it [here](  PLOT: the plot is, like I said, about helping. We see koyomi araragi, trying to find himself by helping others people. The watch order isn't chronological, so I won't talk about the start, I'll talk about "" Bakemonogatari"", the first part to watch.  The story is split between two parts, alternating. The first one is araragi helping girls with theirs ""oddities"". The second one is the [(ep. 5)](#s ""relation between senjougahara and araragi"")  Monogatari has a plot about his characters and their personality, naming (by himself) arcs with more or less each character that will either expose his/her problem or be developing her personality. For example, the first arc is "" Hitagi Crab"". The anime has very social philosophical themes.   CHARACTERS  This is one of the best points of this anime. All characters are so well written. Araragi our protagonist is a good example, between his questions About himself and his will to help people, he's got a really good character development as the story goes. Few characters an as good as Araragi but they're all unique and more or less complex. The best in them is the development, v starting with Hitsgi being a typical tsundere murdering Araragi making fun of him. Then the character appears to be much more than that. It's refreshing after all those slice-of-life anime with typical stereotypes of characters to have really deep personalities. Oh, and you don't see any character that is not important. The streets will be empty. Each time you a class, there are no students. Each character you see is an event. I will add that the world is shown as how characters see him. When a guy is thrown a the wall by his sister, if the wall breaks, it's that He exagerate it. We see the world as (most of the time) Araragi, or any protagonist at the time.  DIALOGUES: this anime deserves this category to be a part of. I can't say much as they're hard to describe. Dialogues are so well written in this anime, they're so good that some people are learning Japanese to watch the Monogatari series in Japanese! There are long. This anime is full of dialogues, this is even the main thing that you will see.   ART: at first, Monogatari is a light novel. It does have a manga, but studio Shaft did a masterpiece in the anime. All those color palettes and those decors. I just have to link one tho show you. They're all abstract and unique. I mean, look at [this]( This speaks by itself.  Bad thing: All anime have faults. This one does. It has, during some parts, a bit of ecchi. And it's awkward. Yes, some people will say it's to reinforce Araragi's strange personality and the craziness of some characters. I just warn you. If you're uncomfortable with ecchi, it contains some. It's not a big part of the anime though.  LAST WORD: Monogatari is different. It tries things and does them well. Some will love it, some will hate it. One thing is sure, it's that the Monogatari series isn't forgettable. It has issues, so why do i give it a 10/10 ? cause, even with his issues, its still higher than any other anime i saw.",anime,n1kg8t

"What are the best anime adaptations of manga ? There are pathetic anime adaptations like One Piece that are dragged for the sake money and then there are anime adaptations like Bleach, JoJo that enhanced what were already great manga thanks to great animation, building up mystery, great soundtracks, voice acting, staying true to the source and well choreographed fight scenes. Unless the fight scenes are dragged in anime like One Piece, fights in anime is always gonna be better. So what are the best anime adaptations of manga according to you ?",anime,juqdvy

"I need more wholesome cute girls doing cute things in my life to fill the hole that finishing K-On left. Emphasis on wholesome. I absorbed everything I possibly could from K-On and desperately want to watch more stuff with the same vibe. K-On had a small amount of fanservice which didn't even feel fanservice-y if that makes sense which makes me love it a lot more. Since then I've tried to fill the hole that it left but haven't found anything as nice.  Since finishing (and rewatching at least 5 times) K-On I've seen:  * Love, Chunibyo, & Other Delusions * Nichijou (<Closest I've gotten to cute girls doing cute things vibe, but feels very distinct from K-On for the loose plot structure) * Miss Koboyashi's Dragon Maid (Way too much fanservice for me, especially in regards to Kanno. I almost didn't want to continue the story when I got to the weirdly lewd scenes involving her, but persevered because of how hearwarming Koboyashi and her love for the dragons is)  And that's about it for slice of life anime that I've committed to. Before this I only watched shonen anime and all-time classics like Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Akira, etc.  Right now the only thing I have on my list next is Yuru Camp, but I'd love more suggestions because I can see myself binging it quickly.

Messed up romance is also something i like, like a The Garden of Words or Scum’s Wish (Kuzu no Honkai). Basically something unconventional which makes you question life and relationships.

I’m thinking about giving Fairy Tail a try.  I’ve heard it’s not great, but I honestly think a decent show that would allow me to switch my brain off might be the best call.  I’ve also thought about giving Gintama a shot for the same reason.   Any recommendations would be appreciated, and it definitely doesn’t have to be shounen-only.  Thanks.

"Please help me find the anime about a girl who looks for her lost brother in the spirit world. When I was younger I used to see episodes of this show on Animax. It's about this girl who sees ghosts in the city and she's looking for her older brother who got lost in the spirit world. The anime style is kind of realistic and it seems like an early 2000's show. All I can remember from the opening theme is that is was like all white in an urban setting, there might have been a train in the sequence. I'm really fuzzy on the details since it's been a while since I've seen it. Hopefully this is enough information for someone to recognize it. It's been bugging me for years that I can't remember it :(  Edit: I was googling the show and found a similar art style to what I remember. The show that I'm looking for has a similar look to the show Otogi Zoshi  which may help to identify the show I'm looking for. Also, the ghosts may have been Yokai because I just recalled that some where not as scary as other ghosts in the show.  Edit:  My bad, it actually /was/ Otogi Zoshi ! I didn't immediately recognize it because the poster made it look like a period specific anime. Anyway, shout out to u/Florin127 for helping me identify it after all these years!!

A lot of the recommendations of mature anime I see here seem to mostly recommend anime that includes a lot of violence, blood, swearing or only superficially touches upon mature theme, includes them for the sake of getting that MA rating, and most of them just do not seem that mature to me, but rather anime versions of GoT basically.   Anime I recently watched which I think are truly mature would be Evangelion, Jin Roh, A Silent Voice, and From the New World. I am looking for anime that treats its subject matter with respect, does not overly sexualize its cast/engage in much fan service, and is overall smart and makes you think about things long after watching it. Thematically, it can be slice of life, political, scifi, and if can be sad or not. Romance is a plus, IF done in a mature way.

"A Place Further Than The Universe / Sora yori mo Tooi Basho I'm not a person that recommends animes to others, cause it's very personal, but different from the other animes, I feel the obligation to do with A Place Further Than The Universe.  This is not an Anime serie, this is a masterpiece desguised as an Anime.  At first you may find too childish and boring, I mean, it's a bunch of kids travelling and dreaming, but the art and the soundtrack keeps your interest.  As the episodes go on, it gets better and better and better. It's an increasing improvement of the characters, their relationship/friendship, their wills, EVERYTHING gets better. The drama intensifies, and what was nothing on the 1st ep. becomes stronger and stronger, till the moment that will rip off A LOT of tears from your face. I've never cried so hard for an Anime or movie like this. And what makes it even greater, is that at the end, it will not make you feel sad or depressed, at least for me. The only sadness was to see the show ends.  I just felt like I had to say something about this anime that is not much talked on the communities.  I've laughed, cried, got sad, happy... and grateful for watching such a masterpiece.  My only regret is not having watched it before.  If you like slice of life, comedy and drama, this is a must watch, or even if you don't, please, give it a try, it'll teach you some good things for the rest of your life.  &#x200B;  Edit: small edits for gramma.",anime,h0b9i2

Examples of animes I watched that fit this description:  \- No Game No Life (12 episodes)  \- Seishun Buta (13 episodes)  \- Vivy (13 episodes)  \- The Promised Neverland (12 episodes)  \- Mob Psycho 100 (12 episodes)  \- Kakegurui (12 episodes),anime,p0ztcx
Anime that shows you why life is worth living I'm going through some depression issues and can't find any reason to live. I'm looking for something that can show me that life does have meaning and is worth living so if you got any of those hit me up.,anime,evk4zd
Animes where no character is safe Hey all. I’m looking for an anime where no character has plot armor. I want to get attached to someone I want to live but with the uncertainty that they could be taken out in the next episode.   Genre doesn’t really matter but I assume most of the suggest will fall into the horror / action / mystery category which is totally fine.   Some similar animes I’ve watched that really captured this feeling were the Danganronpa animes and video games.   Thanks everyone.  EDIT: Way more responses than I expected which is awesome. Looking through every suggestion! Thanks for all the great recommendations and keep them coming!,anime,oy837d
"Drop everything you're doing and watch Saiki K. right now if you haven't already! Edit: Sorry for the bad formatting. I'm on mobile.   WATCH SAIKI K. It is phenomenal. It's the best comedy anime I have ever seen and it's very underrated.   Copying this paragraph from a different thread but I 100% agree with it:   God-tier comedy anime. Hilarious, fast-paced, and witty are understatements to describe this. The pacing is so good that you won't have time to spare to get bored-- it doesn't really have an encompassing plot but I suggest to watch each episode chronologically because there are always new characters added, and you'll have to follow how Saiki tries to hide his powers. The humor varies from slapstick to deadpan, sarcastic, situational, and it never ever gets tiring despite the unique structure. The occasional absurdity never gets old and I can say it's really well-written.   The characters are their each kind of funny, comical, and embodies the exaggerated version of cliche that makes it hilarious. At first the MC may seem cold and lifeless but it gets heart-warming along the way, with how he deals with situations and with the people around him. The MC gets to spend time with each character that really shows his relationships which makes it more interesting.   This is my happy pill anime tbh and one of my few 10s. If you wanna really laugh out loud and feel good, I highly recommend this!    x-x-x-x   Adding to that paragraph, the English dub is AMAZING! It's one of the few English dubs I really enjoyed. The translators make sure that nothing gets lost in translation and even improve on the jokes to appeal to the western/English speaking audience. There's only a dub for the first season though.    Although not on par with the anime, the manga is pretty good too. It's one of the few Mangas I've read after watching the anime for it.  Again, I highly recommend watching the anime if you're looking for comedy anime. It's one of the only anike I'd rate 10/10.",anime,ieng4h

"Newcomer looking for a down-to-earth show without fanservice I'm completely new to anime. I watched Pokemon when I was a kid, and I've seen a handful of Studio Ghibli movies (I *love* Kiki's Delivery Service), but that's pretty much it. I'm aware of a lot of the tropes used in anime, but I don't know much about Japanese culture in general. I figured it was about time to check some out, but I'm not sure where to start.   I'm looking for something grounded. No big energy battles, giant mechs, or anything like that. Same goes for the characters and storyline. No contrived plot twists or over-the-top, wacky characters, just something down-to-earth and believable.   I also don't want any sex or fanservice scenes. Romance isn't my thing, but it's okay if it's kept to a minimum.  EDIT: Thank you for the insane amount of responses! I think I'll go with either Mushishi or A Place Further than the Universe, but you've given me lots of ideas for later if I find myself wanting more anime!",anime,mbtvny

Anime in which MC is not a pervert So I'm looking for anime in which MC is not a pervert or doesn't cares much about girls (like kiyotaka from classroom of the elite). If he is slight pervert (like kyon from haruhi suzumiya) then it's fine.   [here]( is what I have seen.  My ID is fairly new because I never cared about it before up until now  I had to drop few of the anime because I'm not a fan of fan service and shows like highschool of the dead and monogatari were too much for me so I had to drop them :'( but I do enjoyed durarara but had to drop due to my exams ( I will pick it up sometime ).

People say it's the best part but it seems like the worst one as of now. It had an amazing start but the last 10 episodes have been SO bad. They just seem like bad fillers. The entire things about Josuke fighting the midget over the lottery ticket. The girl with a crush on Koichi.... It's not interesting at all. I didn't like part 3 that much too because of the same reason. Does part 4 get better? Or is it not for me?,anime,ipflh2

"Watch Charlotte (I won't bother with a synopsis as you can already get that on MAL)  I watched this anime 3 years ago. I never realised how impactful it was. Now everytime I hear that song (you'll know the one once you watch the show), I feel saddened. I can't cry because it was a happy ending but I'm not happy because I wanted more.   You watch anime and you forget it the next year, but Charlotte is something that will remain in your mind and continue to influence you. You want more, even if there is no more story, even if things did come to an end, you still wish for more. By far my favourite anime.   Spoilers*****  I actually felt the characters moving on to a normal life, from being in a world of superpowers and responsibilities, they were finally free and could now live a normal life. I felt that change in their life, and I wanted to resonated with their words. Especially,  ""Let's all live happy lives from now on""",anime,ga13bl

Recommendations for a girl? Hello ☺️ As we all know many of the anime we know and love are made for a male audience. And not that I’m against a big boobied anime girl if the story is good. But I find a lot of times I try getting into a show only to discover I’ve wasted a bunch of time on a show where that is actually the whole entire point. I love all genres. Anything from down disgusting gore to fluffy love stories to shows where you just cry the whole time and everything in between. Thank you!  TLDR; I would like some recommendations for a NEW anime without too much fan service.  EDIT: Thank you so much everyone! I will never ever have to ask for another recommendation for as long as I live now 🙃,anime,j1ouy4

"Looking for an anime with mature characters and unique/cool powers I would prefer adult characters, but i'm cool with teenagers as long as they're more mature than the average teenage shonen protag. Reading about Todoroki's powers from MHA is what inspired this post, so I guess MHA would be a good comparison for what kind of powers i'm looking for. It doesn't need to be a superpowered society or exactly similar powers though, i'm just throwing that in as a point of reference. I'd like a good story of course, and while a good dub would be nice, it's not totally necessary.   Throwing this in as a bonus because it seems less likely, so feel free to ignore it, but an anime with unique powers BUT no fighting sounds interesting to me, lmk if any of y'all know something like that  [Anime list](  Edit: This got way more responses than I was expecting.

"For all the Cat Lovers, Watch This: Doukyonin wa Hiza, Tokidoki, Atama no Ue. **Doukyonin wa Hiza, Tokidoki, Atama no Ue.** **(eng. My Roommate is a Cat)** is an underrated, yet wholesome and heartwarming anime about the wonderful relationship of an awkward guy and his adopted stray cat. I'm not a fan of slice of life animes because they mostly lack plots, but this anime captured my interest since it's about a cat, and I'm a cat owner myself. And boy, it didn't disappoint me.  The story starts off with Mikazuki Subaru, an awkward and introverted mystery novel author. He would rather stay at home and read his books than interact with people. In addition to that, his parents died in an accident years ago, leaving him all alone. One day, while visiting his parents' grave and contemplating about his next novel, he met a tuxedo cat (to which he later on named as Haru) and took her home.    The anime is basically Subaru and Haru trying to understand each other’s feelings. Each episode shows both of their perspectives and the reason behind their actions. While Subaru is acting like every owner does, Haru sees him as a human she must protect at all cost, and surprisingly, her actions kind of reverberated to him, and he becomes more affectionate to her towards the end. I really liked their character developments, which is mostly rare in slice of life animes.   Additionally, the supporting characters don’t really have any major impacts, but they still help develop the relationship between the two main characters. They also serve as comic material, adding more humor to the life of Subaru and Haru.  Another charming aspect of the anime is its backstories. They provide a solid foundation to the personality of the main characters. Especially Haru, who had lived a harsh life on the streets with her siblings. The backstories give a tinge of sadness to the overall wholesome theme of the story.  I wouldn’t say that the animation is top-notched, but it fits perfectly well to the atmosphere of the anime. It’s the typical vibrant and simplistic style mostly found in other slice of life animes. The OP and ED are quite catchy, and I’ve found myself looping the OP over and over again.   Overall, “My Roommate is a Cat” is a wholesome slice of life anime perfect for cat lovers and cat owners since there are a lot of relatable content. Its relaxing and delightful scenes are also perfect for those who want to relieve their stress and take a break from heavy action and drama anime series. Highly recommended.",anime,kztkca
"give me your strongest 'despair' anime When I am talking despair I am not necessarily meaning horror although it can be.  But just that dark glum cloud that wavers through the show - i'm talking like banana fish, madoka magika, Ga-Rei-Zero, devilman crybaby, (I know it's a manga) or like oyasumi punpun! (emergence, confidential confessions)   oh and for anime obviously there is the grandfather Evangelion.  I don't know how to explain it it's like there is a fine line between well done emotional despair and trying to be edgy- (i'm looking at you Magical Girl SITE)   honestly these type of shows/manga really help me cope with truama. but I also seem to be a masochist and like getting my heart ripped apart!

"Anime with an anime character that always seems happy and jokes around but actually has a pretty bad past or present I don't know if this is allowed but I really want some anime with a character (doesn't have to be main character) that is always joking around, mocking people and just being really secretive about themselves never talking seriously even though they have stuff going. It's complicated as an example Obi from Akagami no Shirayukihime he never really had anywhere to go back to before he met the main characters and there was a moment when he just went back and got welcomed by them and just gave a big smile nothing too important but that melted my heart because it was so clear what he felt in that moment just being happy that he has a place to go back to. I would really want to see something like that in another anime it was really nothing but it meant a lot to me. It's really complicated and I don't know how to put it. But I really like the characters that even though are close seem really distant because they never open up and are always just making everything seem like a joke. Maybe because I can relate.

"Serial Experiments Lain ###Introduction   How much power does the internet have? How much are we controlled by it? Is the virtual world just as real as ours? Or is it an artificial world, because we created it and have control over it? Do we have control over it? If you were to live in a virtual world, would that world be real to you?  Serial Experiments Lain is a show that strives to answer some of these questions and even though there might not be a clear answer, the show never fails to provide many different and interesting perspectives.    ###Basic Information  **Title:** Serial Experiments Lain  **Genre:** Psychological, Mystery, Sci-fi  **Studio:** Triangle Staff  **Duration:** 13 episodes  **Aired:** 1998  **Source:** Original  [MAL link](   ###Why you should watch it  **An unmatched feeling of immersion**  Serial Experiments Lain works with very little telling and a lot of showing - often through cryptic metaphors and symblos. The first episode has almost no dialogue and there isn't much talking later on either. The episodes have an incredible flow and feel like they're over before they even began.  The first moments of any series, book, game, etc. have incredible power, because they're the first taste that the viewer will get of the work. Think of the opening scene of Elfenlied; a silent, naked girl wandering around in an underground complex, killing everyone in her way with invisible arms. After that scene, the tone set, the theme is established and the viewer is hooked. You can truly say that the first scene is magical. Serial Experiments Lain manages to keep up this magic, this immersion of the first moment throughout it's entire runtime. Think the first Kara no Kyoukai movie but it's 13 episodes.  **What is reality?**  Not only is this a central theme of the show, but it's also a question that you will ask yourself over and over again. Works like Monogatari and Perfect Blue are prime examples of the power of an unreliable narrator and Serial Experiments Lain is as well. What is Lain's imagination, what's a metaphor and what is actually happening? The truth is hidden somewhere in plain sight and the show gives you the tools to discover it. Don't trust Lain, only trust yourself.   **A journey through the wired world**  The plot of Serial Experiments Lain is complex to say the least. You will really need to pay attention if you want to understand what is going on. The show is not as hard to understand as it's sometimes made out to be, but it definitely requires you to carefully listen to the information packed conversations and pay close attention to the details that tie into the different plotlines. I'll let you decide for yourself if that's a plus or a minus.  **Lain**  Our lovable, smart and introverted MC is almost her own story. She chases the truth, but soon discovers that what awaits her is much more important to her than she thought at first. The truth can be harsh, but it's the truth and the only thing you can do is accept it. While she sees through others and manipulates them, Lain constantly struggles to accept who she truly is and that's what makes her so intriguing. The development she goes through is significant and will definitely keep you invested.  ###conclusion  Serial Experiments Lain will immerse you immediately, take you on a ride through complex and mysterious plotlines, make you question your reality, finally let you go and leave you wanting more.  Give it a watch, you won't be disappointed.  Ps: The [Opening ]( is absolutely wonderful.",anime,kk0htv
"I'm losing my passion for anime, what can I watch to get me hooked in again Anime has been in my life for as long as I can remember. During quarantine I binged a lot of anime for the first time and had a lot of fun consuming so much of it. Although lately in these past few months my anime drive has been slowing down. I'm even making time for it less because I don't feel as immersed as I used to be.  I think this might come from me now having seen enough anime to the point where I'm seeing tropes used over and over again. I'm hoping that watching something less predicable while also very entertaining will give me back that drive I once had.   I won't list the types of anime I tend to usually like because the problem could also be that I need to get out of my comfort zone... A really good story (without needing to watch a lot of episodes to get hooked in) is all I ask for.",anime,o7ce0x
Smart protagonist Looking for a Psychological/Thriller/Drama anime with a smart and introverted protagonist that is also under 24 episodes.

"Watch Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo (The Pet Girl of Sakurasou) I went with zero expectations into this show, just because I saw a scene where the main girl (Shiina) was dressed in a cat costume. But what I experienced after the 3rd episode was something i never expected.   I would not say that this show is underrated, becuase it is not. But I think a lot of more people should see the beauty of covering up drama elements with good comedy. It is not a masterpiece and I would not say it's the best show i've ever watched, BUT I think it's perfect how they adress important topics like future anxiety, to be scared of failing or what the sad but true difference between spending days/weeks on something or to just have talent in it, is.  The music is also a big part of the show. With it's simplicity and mainly being played on the piano, it fits the vibe of the show perfectly. Days of Dash is one of my favourite OST's to this day.   I convinced 2 of my friends to watch this show and they absolutely love it. One just watched Konosuba and Kaguya Sama and the other one watched over 150 shows and is mainly a Shonen guy, I think that shows what different kind of people can like this show.   So all in all I can say that it's not the best show, but it definitely deserves more attention, because many people struggle with the same problems adressed in this show.  &#x200B;  P.S.: I'm sorry for my bad english at some points.",anime,gtck9b

"Grand Blue is a great anime and I seriously recommend to watch it. It's one of the best anime shows but is sadly underrated and didn't receive much recognisation which it should have received. It's a comedy + slice of life show with lots of adult jokes. I have watched many comedy shows before but this show is the only one that made me laugh the hardest. You may not find the plot of the show interesting at first when you read it but as soon as you watch the pilot episode, you will be sucked into this world. Also you can check out it's manga which is much better than the anime.",anime,d2ljxj

It's kinda like a fever dream but I can recall that in the video theres this guy and he like stumbles upon this girl thats on top of a tree and she jumps down on him. And then i remember they looked at chickens in a cage or something and there was this thing about the girls grandma. I remember reading the comments and someone said its a pretty old classic romance anime and it had pretty good animation for its time, and like the girls grandma dies (or died) and its pretty sad in that aspect or something.

"Looking for modern anime with a 2000s vibe I'm looking for any newer series reminiscent of the kind of shows that were more common from the late-90s through the mid-late 2000s.  Something a bit darker (I mean thematically, not just that it has lots of blood and gore or whatever), that isn't riddled with or trying to sell itself entirely on fanservice, that actually wraps up its story instead of ending abruptly because the studio didn't know if they were going to greenlight a second season.  I'm talking stuff along the lines of the original FMA, Death Note, Witch Hunter Robin, Paranoia Agent, Wolf's Rain, etc.  You know, the kinds of shows you used to see on Adult Swim at 1am when you were supposed to be in bed.  Anyone know any shows like this made in the last 5-6 years or so?",anime,khfy2g
"WATCH DORORO I've started watching dororo, and honestly. It's a beautiful anime. The op is amazing and is all round really easy to watch. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for something you might have not seen. Plus it isnt long at all with around 27+ episodes from memory. I really dont want to say too much more because it's best to just enjoy it. Little bit of gore but most of the gore is artistic if you know what I mean  Update: on episode 14 now and I dont like the new op as much. The show feels slower but still I enjoy it.",anime,gbycpv
"Manga with a very morally grey (looking) character? Okay, so this might be a very weird ask for suggestions but I just recently finished reading the manga ""Birdmen"" and I loved that one of the characters was clearly supposed to look suspicious by drawing his face completely in the shadows with his eyes showing a strong contrast. I don't know how to ask this question without spoiling too much about the manga - it's a great read, you should give it a try! - so I'm thinking about getting visual help...   Are there any manga with a lot of panel shots like this: [Manga Panel where one of the character's faces is extremely shaded](  I know most mystery mangas have at least one panel with this drawing technique but I'm looking for more than just one-time occasions. I love these types of drawings, especially if it's used on the main characters and they appear to be morally grey. So I'd like to read some more :P  Also if any of you have already read ""Birdmen"", do you have any suggestions for other mangas with characters like Takayama?  Edit: Ok so a lot of manga have been mentioned so I thought why not list them for people who are looking for the same thing as I did without searching all the comments...

"Need help finding an anime I remember seeing this anime in an Arabic dub in a TV program called JeemTV which tells you its popular enough to get many sorts of uncommon dubs.  &#x200B;  Parts I'm sure about:  \-The villain had glasses  \-The villain had a suit that gave him super-strength (behind the gloves was a wooden hand he controlled with his real hand). The appearance of the suit cover the mechanisms of the tech he put there giving him the appearance of a mysterious man in a red robe/cloak with a hoodie that puts a shadow over his face so it cant be seen  \-The main character didn't know the villain was actually the villain and thought he is helping him  \-The villain drove an airship  \-There was another person who was wearing the exact same clothing as the villain he had some very advanced tech but didn't have the suit which gave him super strength and he was one of the good guys  \-The show reveals the villain is the villain when he goes into his suit to break some ice that is holding down his airship  \-The villain had a beard  &#x200B;  Parts I'm not sure about:  \-The anime might have had a kid for the main character  \-They might've been searching for some sort of city of gold or temple of gold  \-The title of the anime might have had ""gold"" in it  \-The villain might have been ginger   Edit: My stupid-ass thought it wasn't the city of gold but it was! Thank you all so much, I realised its the same one when I remembered about the solar powered ships and the villains name. However when I saw it I assumed its not the same one due to animation quality, I could have sworn it had better animation though   Edit 2: I found a remake that matches the quality of the animation (2012 remake)",anime,ldraya

You'd also think respawning on death would get repetitive? But nope. It's characters carry it. It's just that good.  In conclusion, watch re zero.

"I can’t remember this anime that I watched late one night about 7 years ago. I’ve been looking am ever since and haven’t been able to come up with anything. Please help!! I watched an interesting anime late late one night on YouTube. I do this sometimes because I’m an insomniac. Yet this anime has stuck with me and I can’t remember what it is after 7 or so years of looking. I don’t remember much about it other than visual aspects and a single scene.  From the art style I might guess it’s mid/late 90’s or early 2000’s (I could easily be wrong though). The eyes were a long vertical style but they weren’t exactly round. They weren’t “realistic” but the line sets were a lot cleaner and not “cartoonish”. It had a slightly high white balance from what I remember and used a good amount of full colors.  I don’t exactly know the plot because I only saw two episodes. But what I do remember, that it revolves around a full grown man (I believe late 20’s early 30’s?) who finds young girl all alone in a snowy forest (most likely a clearing but I’m not 100% on that.) The little girl is closed off at first and doesn’t talk much. From what I can guess by how it seemed to be going he would most likely take her home and care for her because she seemed malnourished and not in the best conditions. From there I could only speculate but i’d be very thankful for anyone who can help me find it. Thanks for reading.  Edit 1: this anime is also in a “modern” day setting. (“Modern” at the time.) They have trains, cars, trucks and flip phones. I think I remember the guy on a train looking at his phone?  Edit 2: The guy had like an…. Olive green long, maybe tench coat on. I think he had brown dress shoes on. He had a flip phone. I vividly remember the flip phone. It had a square screen on the front and was dark blue. That could be the artist rendition of black so that it didn’t look weird but it was definitely dark blue at least. He had glasses I think but I could be wrong. He had a pointed chin. Both characters were pale but that could be from the high white balance (might also be the case with the phone being blue rather than black, idk but I’m fairly certain it was blue). He had either brown or black hair that came down straight and ended in points all around his head. I definitely remember he was on a train at some point in the two episodes. Idk if He had a briefcase or not but I don’t think he did. He might have had blue pants on. Don’t know if they were dress pants or not.  The girl had brown hair…. Either Brown, Blue or Grey eyes, pale skin. I don’t recall a lot about her clothing but from what I remember she had a coat and black(?) pants. I don’t remember the color of her coat. It might have either been brown, or a dark blue (maybe purple?) with a scarf maybe?  The show all around felt like a slow burner, at least at the start.  Edit 3: I don’t know the genre but it didn’t seem to be anything like magic or whatever. It wasn’t very bombastic at the start but there was definitely the possibility that the girl might have turned out to be magic or something but a swordsman or a knight or whatever doesn’t fit the vibe imo.  Edit 4: I’m 98% certain it was a dub (at that point I normally refused to watch anime if it wasn’t in English). If memory serves correctly the title wasn’t translated. That might have just been uploader choice but that’s one of the reasons I didn’t memorize the title. (The tile was written with English letters but the word wasn’t English)  Anime’s it is not: InuYasha, Darker than Black, Kanon (neither 2002 nor 2006), Clanad After Story, Vampire Knight, Erased, Mushishi, Eden of the East, Chobits",anime,olxjhh

"Watch Hyouka (if you haven't) With Almost 7 years and ranking #72 on popularity (MAL) I wanted to recommend it to those who just put this show on watch later shelf or never bother to give it a try. This show is basically Slice of Life with Mystery elements and this show portraits that Mystery not always need crime or detective interaction but basic day-to-day problems can be a potential. I personally enjoys the hypothesis that everyone put to think which fits the scenario. The characters are lovable with soothing environment. You just cannot hate Chitanda Eru and how she manipulates Oreki by her infamous phrase. The animation is simply beautiful trademarked kyoani style with mesmerizing Ost's, they are just too good. It's almost incredible how they made me put my hypothesis for the scenario but maybe it's not true for everyone. All wrapped up I would like to recommend this show or at least give it around 2-3 episode to build up as mystery arc takes place. The characters being connective still takes part in my heart. Maybe end would dissatisfy some  but overall I really want to give it a shot and enjoy this masterpiece of show!",anime,fgd87l
"Please give Food Wars a chance So I just finished Food Wars anime and I'm writing this while listening to OP and EDs. Food Wars is an amazing series that i never thought i'd love it this much. When I saw first 2 seasons on Netflix, I was like ""yeah what's the harm lets try it, its about food and its also ecchi, should be fun"" oh boy i was not expecting this much. Loveable characters, always delicious looking food, fan service here and there but I was fine with it adds ""flavor"" or should i say ""umami"", so many hype moments on shokugekis, amazing OP and ED songs and many more that I can't think right now because I'm a little sad that its over now.  &#x200B;  I had so much fun watching Soma, Erina, Megumi, Alice, Kurokiba, Hayama, Tsukasa, Isshiki, Takumi, Isami, Nikumi and all the other loveable cast members fighting each other with food. I can say its one of my favorite series right now and I'll probably watch first 2 seasons again in the future since i think those are the best and funniest seasons also they are on Netflix, for other seasons you might have to sail to seven seas but its so worth it. I saw many hate and complaints about series that I'm sad some people might saw them and changed their minds about giving it a chance. Please do it, you might find something you wouldn't expecting just like me and it may become your new favorite. Now I'm gonna check out the manga since I just learned it has a few extra chapters that takes place after the story and maybe I'll read it from start. And if you decide to start the series after reading this then ""Oagariyo"" and ""Osomatsu""  &#x200B;  Sorry in advance for my grammar mistakes and thanks for reading.",anime,ow0pbp

I just finished binging this show over the course of two days, and it is one of the most interesting, gripping, and complex animes I've ever seen. It has absolutely everything I look for in an anime: Great characters, an unsettling mystery, compelling romances, and -- by the name of best-girl Saki -- the writing is some of the best I've ever seen in this medium.   Another thing: there is a lot of anime out there that attempts social commentary, and most of the time I'm left underwhelmed by their messages. But, omg: Shin Sekai Yori presents an extremely challenging and interesting one. If anyone has read A Brave New World, its that level of challenging you on what you think you believe is moral and ethical.

With how hectic everything going on around Leo (MC) is. But through the 24 episodes you get to explore Hellsalems lot formerly known as New York City.  “When a gateway between Earth and the Beyond opened three years ago, New Yorkers and creatures from the other dimension alike were trapped in an impenetrable bubble and were forced to live together. Libra is a secret organization composed of eccentrics and superhumans, tasked with keeping order in the city and making sure that chaos doesn't spread to the rest of the world.”  The cast of characters are extremely fun and mesh together so well.

"Pls recommend me happy and fulfilling anime to mitigate Post-Anime Depresion Syndrome Hello everyone!  I was asking you a few weeks ago for sad/emotional anime because I like to cry and have been in kind of a sad binge since. However, I finished Toradora! yesterday and I'm heavily suffering from Post-Anime Depression Syndrome. It left a huge void inside of me and I need to get over it. So please, recommend me some happy anime that will make me have a good time so I can eventually go back to my sad binge hahaha. I don't care about the genre, I don't mind ecchi/fanservice and it doesn't have to be a 10 on MyAnimeList or AniList by any means, I just want to enjoy it.

Despite loving them all, they get emotional towards the end and also left me with a void inside :(  Edit: I think I didn’t express myself well enough on that las paragraph. My English is not that good and I find it hard sometimes to express some things. What I wanted to say is that I found Bunny Girl Senpai, Charlotte, Darling in the FranXX and Angel Beats quite funny and sarcastic but towards the end they became “sad” and left me with depression. Same as Toradora. The ones that I enjoyed with no depression afterwards were Haikyuu and Kaguya-Sama. I hope it is clearer now.

"Absolute beginner So, despite being old and grumpy, I have been introduced to the works of Studio Ghibli by a friend recommending their output as suitable for my children, and I find the quality of animation and beauty of the stories captivating.  (Even though my youngest is definitely too young for Spirited Away and won’t be watching that for a couple of years yet)  Being from a Western background I know nothing of other films or series that are available, but can see there’s a rich world out there.  I have two requests really:  1.  Other films or series that would be suitable for younger family watching, ideally not gun-heavy.    2.  As an adult, I’d be interested in knowing what the best films or series are for someone like me, who has no prior anime knowledge, and whose preference is for slightly odd films such as “The Grand Budapest Hotel” or “An Evening With Beverley Luff Linn”  I’d prefer to stay away from anything that’s too dark or indiscriminately violent, for me there’s too much of that in reality to want it in my escapism.  EDIT:  Can I just say thank you to everyone who has responded to this.  I’m slightly overwhelmed by the sheer volume of responses and can see that I’m not going to be short of films/shows to watch for some time to come.  Thank you for being such an amazing community.",anime,mst73s
Good unpopular/underrated anime I can't find new anime to watch and the top titles don't interest me that much.  Looking for some hidden gems. Here is my MAL [ and thanks for the recommendations.,anime,nad4wo
"Lack of rom-com anime supply. Any suggest? Suggest me some anime where:  1. It is a romance and comedy anime 2. There are 2 or more heroine that have feeling for the MC. It is even better when they are jealous of each other but the MC tries to be fair between all of them. 3. The MC is a passionate character, confident, or a comedic person (e.g. shirogane in kaguya-sama/gintoki in gintama). He is not emotionless/flat nor too arrogant. 4. It's not a shoujo anime (where the MC is female and surrounded by male)  I sort this anime below which describe my point but I've watched all of it:  1. Gotoubun no hanayome/The quintessential quintuplets 2. Nyan-koi 3. Jitsu wa watashi wa/Actually, I am... 4. Tokyo ravens 5. Yuragi-sou no yuuna san/Yuuna and the haunted springs 6. Monster musume no iru nichijou 7. Masamune kun no revenge/The revenge of masamune 8. Bokutachi wa benkyou ga dekinai/We never learn 9. Oreshura 10. Nisekoi 11.

Kanojo okarishimasu/Rent a girlfriend (The heroines are good but the MC is more like unconfident) 18. Kannagi (it is not labeled as romance in mal, but I see slightly romance development in it and I love it) 19. D-frag (it is also not labeled as romance as kannagi) 20. Busou shoujo machiavellianism (it is same like kannagi and d-frag)  Edit:  I've watched this rom-com anime below too, but I didn't add them to the list because I think it's not describe what series I'm looking for. But still they are pretty good and funny series tho:  1. Kaguya-sama love is war 2. Seishun buuta yarou/Bunny girl senpai 3. Wotaku ni koi wa muzukashi/Love is hard for an otaku 4. Sakura-sou na pet no kanojo 5. Golden time 6. Otome game no hametsu flag/My Next Life as a Villainess 7. Murenase! seton gakuen/Seton Academy: Join the Pack! 8.

"An anime that permanently changed how you think and live your life? I am looking for an anime that had a permanent effect on you and made you change as a person. Hopefully for the better.

Who else is in their 30's and still watches anime? I feel old. I used to watch anime on adult swim and DVD. I got back into it and I'm binge watching Toradora on Tubi. I like it. :D It feels good to watch anime. It's like a cool hobby that keeps me entertained and out of trouble. I wonder if there's other people like me that still watch or got back into it. Let me know and let me know what anime you like to watch. ^ _ ^,anime,13z4lu6
"Ecchi with consent and intent I want to see something shameless. I want an anime where every sexual thing that happens was on purpose and welcome by the person it happened to.

"Give me your favorite anime OP songs, and I’ll pick an anime to watch from there To cut to the chase, instead of watching an anime because people talk about how good it is, I usually discover what I watch through having a japanese song on shuffle, listen to its “suggested songs” after that, and finding out that the song playing is an anime OP/an anime soundtrack at least. If I like the song so much that I keep replaying it, that usually is what budges me to watch the anime, and honestly I’ve loved everything I’ve watched from my song hunting so far (Jujutsu Kaisen, Domestic Girlfriend, Bunny Girl Senpai, Fire Force- which is my favorite)",anime,onjeym
"Anime or manga that'll make me feel like life is worth living despite the pain? I've been feeling depressed and like I don't want to live but am too scared to die all day, a severe bout of health anxiety just hit me as well and has me panicking, so I kinda just want an anime or manga that'll cheer me up, distract me, make me feel happy, make me feel like life is worth living despite the pain and anxiety and uncertainties. Thank you so much.  Edit: Thank you so much to everyone for the encouragement and supportive PMs! I found out I have a very high chance of having a disease that would make life very, very difficult, in the worst case scenario even be fatal, maybe leave me bedridden, and this had me feeling extremely suicidal and convinced I was going to kill myself soon throughout yesterday night, but now... I'm starting to feel.... hopeful, like I still wanna live to my fullest potential in the time my body can still move around, and even if I become a vegetable, hey, I'll always have my anime, manga, and video games!  Edit 2: I'm an absolute dumbass, now that I've went to the doctor, calmed down and looked over the symptoms again, I realized they were a result of my inactivity and I barely had even half the symptoms of the disease I thought I had. Some of the other symptoms that I did have are benign in a majority of people as well and my father and uncle had them as well. Good old health anxiety kicking in again, I'm sorry for worrying everyone here with my antics lol",anime,fbx5pc
"Looking for an anime to really invest myself in About to finish my third rewatch of AOT and decided I need something new that would still give me that same oomph. I want something BIG. Been really interested in berserk for some time now but I'm an awful reader and care too much about sound design to start reading the manga now. So looking for something (perfer 2 seasons or more) that will suck me in, have epic moments and be seriously realized, not just another show. I'm a huge sucker for animation so something with interesting animation would also add alot, if not then I do care about looks quite a bit so if it's gonna be a slide show I perfer it to be a pretty one........................................................................................................................  Some of my favorite shows are:  AOT, samurai champloo, Demon Slayer, Vinland saga, Naruto, Space Dandy, one punch man, Cowboy Bebop...",anime,o8efsj

To coarse the dragon to do anything the protagonist had to dangle a carrot from a stick while riding it. I think there were some mecha element as well but Idk. Its a show from the early 90s I think.  edit: I also remember the protagonist would smack the green dragon / lizard on the head or if it did somthing wrong, and it would become a chibi style character and twiddle its fingers.",anime,kkptof

Please help. I'm looking for an anime based on what I remember about it. I was wondering if anyone happens to know the name of this anime. Sorry if my memory is a bit spotty. Here is what I remember.  - the main charcter was some kind of private hunter who only worked with a girl who would stay home and help him using air drones. - there was a mission he picked up to find someone's brother who went missing looking for a plant. It turned out the plant only grew when watered by blood and the guy he was looking for ended up killing all his friends to get the plant to grow. - at the end of the series the main character had a fight at this prison/child experiment lab he was held captive in as a child.  If anyone knows this series please 🙏 let me know. I have been dreaming about it for 5 days and going crazy trying to remember it.,anime,luplwt
"Looking for a specific kind of ecchi anime Are there any ecchi anime with girls who just casually walk around naked and don't care who sees them nude?

"Dark anime that is highly recommended? So quarantine made me watch anime again and I've missed quite a lot of shows that pertains to anything that is dark. What I've seen so far is Jojo's, AoT, Tokyo Ghoul and Death note. Can you suggest something that is similar from the latter?",anime,g430rw
"You have to watch Orange!!! Watch it, no excuses.    It has 13 episodes with just 1 season. But don't worry about that.     By cover and genre tags it might look a normal romance, drama, school anime. But trust me it is way  more than that. It does not have a lot of comedy but it has enough to give you a good laugh.     What made me write this post is that the plot. Just amazing, unique and probably original. Unlike other school, rom., drama anime this one starts right of the  bat in the first episode and the next thing you know that you are already on episode 10.    I don't want to actually reveal the plot to you guys cause it's crazy. But I'll just say it's about regretting your past for not able to do something that could have been done.   I request all of to just jump in to it and don't read or watch any summary or any kind of trailer. You will get a massive kick if you do that. Just dive in episode 1.     Hope ya'all like it.",anime,hb7uf9
"Help me find an anime that might not even exist So in my early days of watching anime I came across one that was intresting for the majority of the show and then had the most mid ending ever. But now after days of search, I cannot for the life of me find the anime in question. Which lead to the thought that it might not even be real and I finally went insane from all the cultured content I watched.  What i remember: The protagonist in the first episode suffers a bus accident.  Something enters his body through his forearm.  From that point on he can transform into a big monster which looks like an orca and a silverback's love child (i think the color scheme was white orange).  His girlfriend becomes a soldier i think?  Some shit happens.  Turns into a statue.  His girlfriend stands next to the statue.  The end.  I sit there dissapointed.  If someone knows what the show is. Please let me know the name of it and how you liked it. Thank you.  Sorry for bad Portuguese. This is a re-upload because they deemed the first post inappropriate.",anime,oerjin

"Is Haikyuu worth the watch? After being begged by friends to watch it I finally got around to it, but I very much operate by the rule of three (if I don’t like an anime after three episodes, I probably won’t like the rest of it so I drop it). But I’ve heard a lot of good things about Haikyuu, so I’m kind of reluctant to to just drop it. Does it pick up later on? Because I’m not really vibing with it. (I have watched the first three episodes and I’m not hooked).  Edit: I should probably add that I’m not too much of a sports anime fan - I tried Yuri on Ice (to be fair everyone only watched that for the yaoi), Free (also everyone watched that for the hot boys) and kuroko no basuke (dropped after three episodes).  Edit 2: woah, I just woke up and I definitely did not expect this many responses. After reading everyone’s comments (majority saying yes) I’ve decided to tough it out at least until the end of the first season. I know some of you have said that season 1 isn’t quite as good as the next seasons, but it’s necessary world building. But if after watching the first season I don’t like it, I won’t carry it on because I would have invested a lot of my time into it already, and chances are if I don’t like the first season I won’t like the rest of it. Thank you all for your responses :)",anime,fslyyo
"Hanasaku Iroha (WT!) Here's a why you should watch for **Hanasaku Iroha (v2)**. Remaking this post because 1) Old post didn't get as much traction as I would've liked. 2) Trying out the new system. Literally reading the rules as i type this.  So, on to the actual content  **Title**: Hanasaku Iroha (2011)  **Studio**: P.A works  **Length**: 26 Episodes x 24 Minutes  **Genres**: Slice of Life, Drama, Comedy  **Link**: [  **From the studio that brought you Classics like Angel Beats (2010) and True Tears (2008), comes a SoL never before seen. Hanasaku Iroha, 2011, is without a shred of doubt my absolute favorite anime of all time.**  Hansaku Iroha has everything - Visuals that far exceed its time, a Story that is unprecedented till this day, Characters that are intriguing and behave as realistically as actual humans, a Sub-Plot so good it could actually be a story of its own and last but not least, all of these achieved in 2011! (A lot of the objective criticism will trace back to this)  **Brief rundown** (my own rephrasing?)  >!The story follows a 16 year old **Matsumae Ohana**, forced to move from the bustling city of **Tokyo** to a Rural Town of **Yunosagi**, (based on the real life location of the **Nishigishi Station** in the city of **Nanao**) after her mother, **Matsumae Satsuki**, decides to elope with a man she recently met WITHOUT taking Ohana. In **Yunosagi** lies an Inn called the **Kissuiso,** run by Satsuki's mother or Ohana's grandmother. Sent there by her mother, Ohana must find a way to cope with her new life at the Kissuiso, following in her mother's footsteps of ""Rely only on yourself"".!<  &#x200B;  **In depth explanations** (I suck at these bear with me, in fact I've never even tried it)  **Visuals**  * Not much to say about this other than the fact that it's absolutely beautiful. For a **26 episode TV series anime** it has some of the best animation. This was in 2011! See it and you'll believe it.  **Story**  * This is the only part where I tend to have a hard time convincing people on how good it is. Without a doubt, this is the 1/2 of the anime's best features. As an Asian, this anime and everything about its' story hits too close to home. The drama is seldom overexaggerated and even when it is, it's usually for the purpose of comedy and not because of a mistake. It has a great flow of story for a SoL, nicely paced with equal parts funny, touching and downright depressing moments. While often bright and loud, **it's during the sombre, quiet scenes backed by the beautifully animated background that truly shine the brightest.**  **Characters**  * **The other half of what makes this show truly a masterpiece**. As it should be with original stories where characters are tailor-made for its progression, no character felt out of place in any way, shape or form. Each character has their own unique set of **priorities**, **personalities** and the most important point - **values**. The show relies **HEAVILY** on the values of its characters. Every decision made by a character is shaped by their values, and this is the main reason of why I think this anime has the best characters. One more important point i forgot to mention is that the **character dialogue** and **overall realism** to real life is uncanny. I wouldn't, for even a second, doubt that any show can come close to what this anime has achieved in its time. If anyone were to disagree with me, let me preface it - **any dialogue that is not made with the purpose of fulfilling comedy is ultra realistic**. And once again, this was written in 2011!  **Music**  * Someone fill me in on this I don't really pay attention to music in anime except for openings and endings. I simply don't think music is too big of an influence on a show.  **Sub-Plot**  * I won't say too much about this because spoilers, but the back and forth of this shows' sub-plot is superb. There was only one small part which I didn't get, otherwise, ***MINT.***  **All in all, i rate this anime 10/10 personally. It is, like i said, without a doubt my absolute favorite anime of all time. If i had to rate this objectively, would ya guess it, it's still a 10/10. I firmly and absolutely believe that whether you come out liking or disliking this, you will not be able to deny this show of it's achievements.**  **So, if you've read this all the way, thank you and please check this anime out. Also here's my** [**MaL**]( **so you guys can come at me and tell me how shit my taste is and how I haven't watched the popular shows hence my hastiness on giving this 10.**  **Also please lower the word limit like making a WT! is almost impossible if you didn't just literally finish watching a show. I watched Hanasaku Iroha a month ago and i'm struggling to meet the word limit.**",anime,hlem65

As a disclaimer I've only seen about half of what's on this list so I had to take a shot in the dark for some of the categories. But I think I was pretty accurate for the most part.  Speaking of categories I should mention a few things about them.  * **Creature** - Anything that has to do with a unique monster. * **Demon** - Hell, fallen angels, et cetera, et cetera. * **Ghost** - If the afterlife is involved then I put it in this category. * **Horror** - Self explanatory. * **Multi** - If it fit into multiple categories without having a main one then I put it here. * **Vampire** - Self explanatory. * **Witch** - If magic as the main theme then it's in this category. * **Zombie** - Anything with the undead.  If none of the anime on the list are doing it for you I'd also suggest [Castlevania]( [The Halloween Tree]( and [Over the Garden Wall]( I didn't include them in the list because well, they're not anime.",anime,dbtxv3

"Hello, first let me be clear , I’m the filthiest of casuals. What’s the ecchi-est anime you can suggest that is still lighthearted/ fun and doesn’t jump the gun into gross? Hey-   I wasn’t big on anime until covid and then it just being a cheap form of entertainment was enough for it to be my main form of entertainment.   Growing up I loved like dragon ball z and naruto on toonami but over covid I’ve managed to consume :   The future diary  Fairy tail  Dbz (cause I just fucking love it)  Kill la kill  AoT  I thought future diary was ok - a little slow but I liked the characters and the heavy themes   I fucking loved fairy tail but I liked the jokes more than the ecchi stuff - can’t say I hated the ecchi stuff though - happy the cat is my Boi   dbz is just the pinnacle and I need not go further   - kill la kill blew my mind - I didn’t know shit about it and only found it because that “pog champ” meme was during covid - but I fucking LOVED it - I have been forcing myself to not get a kill la kill tattoo - (I have a lot of tattoos it isn’t that big of a thing) but klk is peak for me - can’t say enough good about it   AoT is just phenomenal I’ll leave it there/ totally unique to anything else I’ve seen or heard about   But yea that’s my general taste , and I’m totally going to take the suggestions I get so please have at it   I saw seven deadly sins on Netflix btw and that’s the one where I’d say it made its way into gross for me  Also I saw like 200 episodes of one piece ... it’s just a lot of show and I fell off   again , gracias for any suggestions and I have oregairu/kaguya sama on my immediate list while I’m currently watching quint quint",anime,moihdh

"Card anime where mc always loses I remember watching this anime a few years ago about this card game where the mc always loses. I remember it was more parody like and they were making fun of stuff like shouting your cards name in the middle of battle and what not. I pretty sure everyone had only one card and not a while deck.   In the first episode the mc came to school with nothing but his card (no school books or bag) and said that's his card is all he needs. In another episode he didn't want to come to school and his mom challenged him to a battle to make him go and she won.Yeah,a common theme in this show is that he can never win.  I remember in one episode this one dude removed his glasses in the middle off battle and it made him move super fast but then everyone realized how that changes nothing since it's a card battle.  It used to air on Disney XD in Malaysia where I live of that helps. Thx in advance",anime,o4szhp

"Watch Boku dake ga Inai Machi (Erased) I’m still somewhat new to anime and rarely stray away from the typical Action/Adventure/Shōnen, but dam am I glad I did. This show truly deserves all the great ratings it gets.   I sat down to watch the first episode this morning expecting to maybe watch a couple before starting my work. HA nope still haven’t started on my schoolwork yet and won’t until I’m done writing this. That’s how good this show is. Each episode had me anticipating the next. The story was enticing and had me dying to know how it was gonna end. It’s a 10/10 from start to finish. Twelve episodes of mystery and pure entertainment.  If your looking for a show with a memorable story and complete ending Erased is the perfect fit.   (Not great at writing reviews lol but fuck this show was really good just thought I’d throw it out there to anyone like me. If your used to action/Shōnen try out this show for something different. You won’t regret it!)",anime,g50rja

"Help me find the anime!! I've been trying to find this sci-fi movie for ages! I think it's from the 90s.  It's about a girl (long hair, maybe red, or yellow). The movie begins with a piano (classical music) and then her walking on a street. She gets to a forest where I think she is teleported to another universe. I think she wears white clothes, and they drive on small red hover bikes. She probably has some kind of small companion (animal?).  She's fighting something/someone, in like a flying ship or something.  The movie ends with her getting back to the street she was in from the beginning.  I'll add stuff if I remember more.

"Paranoia Agent- In Honor of Satoshi Kon August 24th 2020 will be the 10 year anniversary of the passing of **Satoshi Kon.** Many of you may know his work in the re-discovered masterpiece *Perfect Blue*. Because of this I wanted to bring to light another masterpiece of his that has gone relatively unnoticed in recent years.  *Paranoia Agent* is an anime series that Satoshi Kon created in 2004. Revolving around the anxiety of every day citizens of Japan, the anime is a dissection of the pressures of society, and the complications that arise when that anxiety becomes too much to handle. I feel that this piece is even more prolific today and watch at least 2 episodes will leave you in a sense of ""I don't even know what to do with myself.""  To give a small log line of the story. Set in Japan, the news of a young child with golden roller blades and a golden baseball bat named ""Lil Slugger"" or ""Shonen Bat.""  He has been seeking out random citizens and bludgeoning them to death. We follow many different protagonists through a contextual storyline than intertwines and crosses. Many characters that you meet in one story will most likely show up in their own episode. They are all complex and are all dealing with problems that offer monumental stakes. One episode may deal with a student who is dealing with issues of popularity while the next episode deals with that students teacher and her struggles with life. This may be a vague explanation, but trust me the gold lies with the challenges of the characters and how they overcome their problems. All the while          After watching this anime I was completely floored. I was shocked and horrified. I still have trouble watching the news and seeing nothing but the social dilemmas brought on by this show, and that is absolutely wonderful. Never in my life have I felt so trusted by an anime creator. I felt as if Satoshi Kon was in a real philosophical dialogue with me the entire time I was watching the show. Another genius element is that the show is not hard to follow. Many philosophical anime (like my all time favorite series Steins;Gate) can be difficult to follow due to the nature of its big-brain story. Not Paranoia Agent. This show is pretty easy to follow, and that is why it is such a spooky series. Many times I would notice something in this show and immediately remember a real-life counterpart for a certain element or situation. The real-world parallels are so very potent.   I never had to take a break from anime because a series broke me so effectively, but that changed after Paranoia Agent. Not in a depressing way, but in a way that I needed time to soak in all the wonder this show had to offer.      This anime is INCREDIBLY real and VERY disturbing. It is a series that tests your mentality and delivers some of the greatest pessimistic social commentary I have ever seen without shoving it doen your throat. Nothing is safe or sacred in this anime. As an audience member you will be tested, led astray, and horrified by the world and animation. If you feel like you want to be challenged as an audience member then I have no better recommendation than this anime series. Please give this one a shot. 13 episodes long.  Thank you Satoshi Kon. Rest in Peace.",anime,ie6gw7

"Anime where EVERY episode is great? JUST WANNA SAY THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SUBREDDITS EVER. EVERYONE IS SO WHOLESOME!   As mentioned in title of post.  Starting from Ep 1 all the way to the end.  EVERY single episode must be great.  If there's even one episode that isn't up to par compared to the rest, then it's out of the running!  Thank you!  &#x200B;  **EDIT Do take a look thanksssss :)**  I received some feedback in the comments section stating this post is very subjective. Let me give an example. For instance, Steins Gate is great, but it has a slow start. So Steins Gate is out of the running. I know some people don't think the starting is slow, but more things do happen in the later part of the series. Or as long as you think one episode is still good, but worse than the other episodes, even by a tiny bit, then it is out.  Another example is Clannad, especially afterstory. Slow start and all but the ending is great. Or maybe you don't think the anime is slow but you think the ending is the greatest. Then this show is out as well because all episodes throughout the show must be equally good.  Or another example like Naruto or Boruto, in which some arcs drag on or have half filler/half canon or the writing suffered in some parts.  Basically any Anime that keeps you excited every episode, and there isn't one single episode that is particularly bad, be it the pacing, story dragging on, half filler half canon, poor writing etc. Or that the particular episode is still good, but evidently not as good as the others'.  *I mean my post is still subjective, not going to deny that, but so is almost every other post in this subreddit isn't it. I mean this is a subreddit mainly for anime suggestions and recommendations. It's never gonna be objective.*  **EDIT 2. No more edits haha. I think I have said my piece. Don't wish to overwhelm you readers thanks!**  There is no need to get frustrated at my examples. Just in case you were annoyed, which is understandable.  We all have different tastes. I am not trying to imply that my post is not subjective. Is it,  just that I am trying to narrow down the criteria etc.  Hope this clarifies. Thanks!",anime,r44rhm
"I forgot the name of an anime I used to watch, please help me find it. So basically the story of the anime revolves around a really short, stacked girl who goes to college with her high school senior, a fit guy. The anime is fairly new around 2019-2020 first episode.  * She used to be in the swimming club at school with this guy, where he taught her swimming stuff. As for the guy, he was a really good swimmer. * Now they go to university together. They are in the same classes. * Near the start of the series, they start summer break where they hang out together. * The guy is a loner (he's got one friend) and the girl takes it upon herself to keep him company through the holidays as he was so nice to her in school. * The girl is very mischievous and is very cheeky with how she behaves around the guy. * The girl comes over to the guy's house often and they play video games together. The girl is a bit of a slob though and often falls asleep at his home and makes a mess at his home. * The guy gets a summer job at a café and the girl join him there too. The café is owned by an older man and his daughter. They both are trying to get the girl and the guy to become a couple. They feed off of the drama. * The guy's loner friend takes them on a tour to an island where they have many couple temples, because he is also trying to get his bud hooked up with the girl. The guy is very rich and has a ship.  This is about all I recall. Appreciate any and all help.",anime,o7p41p

"Please Please Watch ""A Certain Scientific Railgun"" ! Currently 9am where I live and I've just spent the entire night binging the 2nd season of Toaru Kagaku no Railgun, and I think I should probably write this while I'm still feeling what I am feeling.  I have watched my fair share of anime and I can't help but say this show is simply legendary. Is it perfect? No, but its as close to perfection as it can get. Its straight up there with the best of the best I have seen.  I generally hate on J.C. Staff of how they are and keep ruining one anime series after another but even I have to say this anime was so amazing.   The animation even though from 2009(Season 1) and 2013(Season 2) definitely beats 99.9% anime made today. The digital effects made me feel as if Ufotable people were working on those beautiful light effects and backgrounds(I will have to check later who the staff is who worked on this show, but I bet I'm gonna see some big names of the industry on here).  The story is full of slice of life fun and wholesomeness as well as really dark and fucked up arcs at times all of which includes really emotional and well done characters development for Misaka and her three friends. Some of the fights are so damn gripping and well done they're a blast to watch.  No matter what genre of anime you prefer to watch kindly please watch this show. Its simply amazing.  Edit : People who are confused about the watch order of the series kindly check this [article]( My bad, I should have included it in the first place since I am recommending this series.",anime,fxedmq

"Please, I wanna hear that heavenly humming again! I've been searching this anime by literally combing through the Internet and Google ended up being useless for once. For context, this is a late 2000s anime that has mecha and supernatural stuff. I came across it on Youtube as a kid and it was one of my favourites. Please anime connoisseurs, help this little one DX   AIGHT ON WITH THE PLOT  Ok so this was like 10+ years ago so please do pardon me if the details are blurry. There is this huge area of miasma that just appeared out of nowhere on Earth and it keeps expanding. Any normal living thing that is inside that area of miasma dies within a short period of time. However, there are glowing white trees (the only plants there) that can only be found within this miasma and being near them/ carrying their flowers around helps prevent one from being affected by the miasma. Japan sends like a bunch of students, who've been specially trained to combat the mutated monsters within the miasma with machines, to find out what causes the miasma and eliminate the source. The main protag, who got ripped out from his suit while fighting, is fainting due to the miasma and suddenly hears a girl singing before conking out. Then within like the last few episodes of the anime, we find out that the mysterious miasma girl and the protag's childhood friends are twins and that the three of them were childhood friends from the same village. The source of the miasma is a monster that they were instructed to bring out from the village or sth like that. I remember it looking quite small and cute when they brought it out. The miasma girl ended up being separated from them with the monster. The protag and childhood friend lost their memories. In the end, the monster was defeated and returned to its not-so-harmful-cutie state.",anime,lre43g

I'm getting sick of checking out posts looking for new content myself and the top comments are always the same popular anime over and over.

Each character is facing some sort of relatable problem in thier lives and they all come together to do this one thing that they didn’t have any hopes for, and it ends up helping them.

"A vague memory from when I was kid So before coming here on reddit I asked a friend of mine who has watched and read more stuff then me and while asking him to help and he told me about this sub, so hopefully it's my lucky day. (disclaimer most of the scenes might be slightly different from original anime cuz bad memory and it is going to be a copy paste of what I wrote to my friend) So like when I was a kid idk how but I stumbled into an anime that I don't remember anything from beside 2 scenes. And I hope I'm not mixing 2 different animes...  So 1st scene I remember is from the start: Scene 1: Small house in Japan at night (family:mom/dad/kid son probably around 10), dad comes home late drunk and starts arguing with his wife. Then the argument escalates and I think (if I remember right) the dad tried to rape his wife. Then the kid grabs one of the dads empty bottles hits him in the head and kills him when he's trying to rape her. Then the mom gets her kid son to her room grabs all the saved money she had and gave it to him and then told him to leave and not come back to the house. After the leaves the room I don't remember very well but I think there is a scene where it shows that the cops have gone to the house and found the dad dead, the mom had hanged herself and she had left a note saying she had killed him I think.  Now for the 2nd scene:  The guy gets adopted by this family that had a daughter a little older then this kid, who would ""use"" their daughter because she had a talent in painting. Even if she was like I don't remember maybe 13 they would make her paint all the time so that they could sell her paintings for money to rich people. I remember them treating the guy badly too(I'm pretty sure I remember a part where the adoptive parents had left and they didn't leave anything for the guy to eat so he was eating just a piece of bread but his step sister comes in and probably makes him something to eat). And I remember another part where like the stpe sister forces the guy to join her on a bath together and forgive me god if this is just a perverted imagination, but I think she forces him in some feaky stuff. (anyways it would be great help if you comment anime or manga or light novel names that have a parentless kid protagonist)   Thank you, like really thank you if you read this all even if you can't help and happy new year!",anime,kq6sqg

"I need a nice magic-based anime that's devoid of fanservice. Before I begin, I'd like to point out that I am new to anime, and I haven't really watched mainstream animes like Bleach, Fist of the North Star, My Hero Academia, etc. So in the end, anything really matters. What I *have* watched so far is One Piece, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One Punch Man, and Mob Psycho 100. The animes I've partially watched, but lost interest to is Naruto, and Bleach.  I know it's a pretty childish thing to get triggered about, but I honestly find pervy crap to be the thing that genuinely kills the experience in watching anime. It makes serious scenes look like pormagraphy, and all the negative opinions on anime in general seem correct.  But besides that, I want to see an anime with magic, because magic opens the gate of limitless possibilities; I wanna watch an anime that *immerses* the existence of magic. If you can, find me something that's wacky or bizarre.  Onto the miscellaneous, then. My preferred protagonist alignment is anything chaotic - even evil. I don't care for when the anime was made or what its art style is. I don't care for the genre of anime, but at least a *little* action would please me.",anime,g2y0ou
"Anime with a really dominant or sadistic female lead? I know a lot of animes which has a dominant girl, but they're usually not the main female lead. When I mean dominant I mean like the girl likes to tease or abuse the boy a lot, and the guy is pretty much submissive to her.

Next best is “heart x hybrid magias academy ataraxia” “Yosuga no sora” would be good, but there’s just too much \*drama\* “Testament of Sister new devil” is close, kind of so is “So, I can’t play H” and even “Tsugumomo”   This triggered after shows like “Sekirei” and “Yuuna and the haunted hot springs” show the typical, oblivious, clumsy, and lucky/unlucky ecchi/harem protagonist just stumbling into boobs left and right.",anime,m8ymu1

"What is this flashback from?? So i just had a flashback of an anime(?) i watched but i can’t seem to remember the name. The scene i remembered is when there was a bunch of criminals sitting(?) together and about to be sent to some kind of prison. Then the MC(?) shows up with a fuck ton of security measurements (like maybe a straitjacket or maybe being tied or surrounded by guards) to indicate that he’s some dangerous big shot and all the other criminals saw him and were surprised and scared(?). Any possible anime sources are needed!

Can someone help me find this movie I lost sleep last night because i remembered a movie i watched roughly 10 years ago. Wether it is an anime or just that animation style is beyond me...anyway so there the anprotagonist where he has lots of purple red colour vibes right and he has these purple red scorpian insect things he used to kill people. They litterally crawl out from his sleeves or something. Hes after something to do with the protagonist which is a chick. She has lots of blue green power vibes. She finds this guy who helps her or she helps him?? They end up getting to the place to power this thing where the lady before her sacrificed her consciousness to power it previously. The main lady after a huge sad good between the boy and girl she sacrifices herseld to power this huge being mech thing where people have full city on/in it. So defend all of it from the evil guy which powers his own in order to wipe her out or something.  I know its long winded and generically every anime ever but i need to know what this is called.  The big mech thing the girl powers is white and angelic i guess whereas the evil one is like black and jaggered.  The way these things are powered is they bothe walked into this diamond shape thing in the wall and wires came out of it and attached themselves to the person. To anyone looking at them they are not conscious and look to be sleeping peacefully. However in their mind they are fully conious about what is happening to the mech city thing they are powering...

"Kaze Ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru (WT!) ##Kaze Ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru   [Cover Art](   ###Introduction:   When it comes to talking about sports anime I am pretty sure Kaze Ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru (Run with the wind) is NOT the first show that comes to mind. The show has a solid 98th place on the MAL top anime list with a very deserving rating of 8.49 and yet doesn't have a lot of people who watched the show while many haven't even heard of it.  The show aired in fall of 2018 written by the author Shion Mura, animated by production I.G studios who are behind classics like Ghost in the Shell, Kuroko's Basketball, Psycho Pass and Haikyuu! The show primarily falls under the Sports genre followed by comedy and drama with a runtime of 23 very gripping episodes.  **MAL synopsis**   [Run With The Wind (MAL)](    ###The Story   [The Team](    The story revolves around 8 Kansai University students who come around each other each other through living in the same worn out house called Chikusei-Sou. The anime starts with the main characters running into each other at a dark street (Haiji and Kakeru) where Haiji finds Kakeru running away from a shopkeeper and gets enticed by his running form. In the heat of the moment Haiji makes an offer for him to live with him at Chikusei-Sou in a way which seemed too good to be true. Only to find out later on that Haiji had tricked him and the others into living in Kansai University Track Club's property and thus they are mandated to take part in club activities. The story goes on from there of how they reach their dream of running in the Hakone Ekiden.   ###Characters   [Haiji and Kakeru](   The characters could not have been further apart in personalities and I believe this diversity is what makes the show so good.  **Kurahara Kakeru**   This is a character that really inspires me. A  character who has had a fall from grace but in the end did fight his way up to the very top. He is a realist who did not agree with with Haiji's dream of running in the Hakone Ekiden believing it was futile. As time passed he grew alongside the team and played a pivotal role in the race.   **Haiji Kiyose**   One of the only 3 in the team who was actually into running and the man who got everyone together to reach his goal. He had a big goal. One that no one believed in. But as each day passed he MADE them put trust in their abilities and really is the man who drove the team. His connection with running was more than just accolades and medals.  **For the sake of keeping it short and leaving it to discover for yourself I will not mention the other characters here. But that does not in any way mean they are any less interesting in their own ways.**    ###Artstyle   When it comes to animations I think the studio does an amazing job at pulling off beautiful scenes even in a show that's simply about running. The art style will remind you of Haikyu! a lot too as they share the same studio and even share the same music directors.   ###Why you should watch it   I know it's easy to put off a show feeling like what can you get from a show that's just about running? But believe me when I say that **I was IN TEARS**  by the end of it and truly inspired by the joy in reaping the results of something you worked for even if it seemed so far away in the beginning. It's not about taking a leap but simply taking the first step. **This show also isn't unnatural in the way that completely inexperienced people suddenly get great at running.** Most of them have athletic backgrounds and the story really shows what it took for each of them to reach at the very top in the end, the Hakone Ekiden. It's a beautifully unique show in it's own way.   ###My impressions   To me it's one of my favorite shows of any genre and I just want more people to know that this anime is out there. If you ever heard about it or thought about watching it then please do give it a chance. It's a perfect fit if you want a sports anime but I believe you might enjoy it even if you aren't even remotely into sports. It's highly spoken about and for all the right reasons.    **TL;DR**  A show focused on a track club accompanied by excellent character development and a story you will not forget.   **Available on: Netflix and Crunchyroll**",anime,hloqtd

"You should watch ""A Place Further than the Universe"" Words can't even describe this anime, it's just too damn good! This show was made by Madhouse, one of the best studios out there. With its breathtaking animations/ art style and incredible music, it's almost as if Madhouse was using movie level budget on a TV series.  On top of that, not a single frame was wasted in this show, every frame was placed there for a reason, whether it be the OP telling an untold story or little subtle details that enhance the story. You can tell that they must have spend a stupid amount of time on just writing alone.  And oh boy is this show inspirational, every SINGLE ep leaves a powerful message. It really makes you want to do something with your life.  All in all, this anime easily made it to the top of my list, it's on par with if not beating my all time favorite anime (S&W, Code Geass, Death Note, Overlord, etc) though to be fair they are very different genre of anime. This anime is very character driven, unlike most anime that are mainly plot driven, giving each character depth while still keeping them realistic and relatable.

Is there an anime character that looks similar to Benedict Blue from Violet Evergarden? Benedict is my favorite character in Violet Evergarden even though he doesn’t appear as much. I was wondering if there are any anime characters that are like him or looks kinda like him. Thank you ~,anime,ht9go6
"Suggestions for an old dude getting into anime for the first time The title explains it. I'm a guy (38m) who skipped on anime up until now, but I've been starting to watch some during COVID lockdown. I've watched a bunch of stuff that is regarded as classic, and loved most of it. Looking for some new stuff has been hit or miss. I'll describe some things that I've loved (or not), if that helps.  &#x200B;  **Loved it:** (most of these are super obvious)  *Neon Genesis Evangelion* \- I would even say that I liked it more and more the weirder it got.  *Cowboy Bebop -* I appreciated the tight integration of visual and audio styles. I also appreciated that the audience is kind of dropped into the middle of things and the world is built out from there.  *Attack on Titan* \- This is really a mindfuck kind of thing to be watching for the first time right now. I like the psychological aspect of it.  &#x200B;  **Liked it:**  *Hunter x Hunter -* It's fun. My only issue is that the plot isn't quite gelling for me yet (25 episodes in).  *Mobile Suit Gundam (and Zeta)* \- These show their age a little bit, but I like the stories of interpersonal relationships during wartime.  *Fruits Basket* \- I like how quiet this one is compared to the other things I've been watching. I do feeling like I might be missing the significance of some of the interpersonal interactions.  &#x200B;  **Didn't care for it:**  *Fairy Tail* \- I'm about 40 episodes deep into this, and I feel like I might be wasting my time. I don't mind the goofy stuff, but it seems to be the same goofy stuff over and over.  *The God of High School* \- Maybe this is unfair because I'm only a couple episodes in. I like the visual style a lot, but the plot seems very trope-y.  &#x200B;  Any thoughts. I'm sure I can continue to look at top-10 lists and find some classics, but what are some new things and hidden gems that people would recommend? Bonus if it is on CrunchyRoll.",anime,hqjmqa

"Manga with Body switch Ayo, sup boys. (and girls)  Wondering if there was any manga where the MC is a kind hearted, generous man, (yes, man, flame me if you want) gets killed, and gets reincarnated, or transported into someone else’s body. (Like a noble, or delinquent, or just anyone in fact)  But turns out that the person they are in was a horrible, evil person. So now everyone is confused that they’re suddenly nice now.  Also works if the mc martial artists, or some sort of marine soldier (like god of black field) and the body they get inside of is weak, and pathetic.  No harem, echii, and if possible, romance.

"Any mystery in a school anime? What I mean is a anime about a mystery in a school, something like “Hyouka”, but my problem with that show was that they would change the mystery, like they solve one and go to the next, what I am asking for is for 1 big mystery, that takes the whole season to figure it out, or they don’t figure it out at at all, sure, they can have side mystery’s related to the big one, what I am saying is that “Hyouka” didn’t have that big mystery, so maybe they didn’t know each other and they join a club and meet, and then they discover some big secret and they start to investigate it, maybe there is a ghost, or the school has a secret organization, or there is a serial killer in the school, I don’t know but something like that, so not a detective anime, you know what I mean? Well I hope you do, ok thank you.  Note: This isn’t really necessary, but I would prefer if it was dubbed and if it wasn’t a harem anime, oh and if it had some comedy or horror elements, like something interesting, ok thank you.

"I'm thinking of writing an anime or manga and this is my idea, I would like your idea on it (I know the wording and story is a bit off so far but right now I'm working on the idea then I will enhance the rest of it. The story of the forgotten ex-guild master who lives for 2000 years  (BACKSTORY)  This anime/manga is set in a world of mutants and magic, set in medival times not much is known but one day, the year 198 to be exact, a strange structure appeared, after closer inspection they found that it led to a strange place, and if you beat those places you would gain power and wealth but the odd thing with it is that when you died in the dungeon, either by a monster or another human or even just a simple thing just as falling off a cliff, drowning, burning or just starvation, you'd be well, resurrected.  After they defeated the first dungeon which was in the center, platforms arose, around 50 of them at least appeared at the top of the pyramid, 4 stayed in the corners whilst the others drifted away, scattered across the world. Each contained a whole separate world, although most were pretty small, from the size of a castle to the size of a barn it was randomized each time you'd go in, you could be against things as puny as a bug or mighty dragons, maybe even gods.  The people made a town around the pyramid, then castles then an entire nation was formed around it all in hope to please it, thinking it was a god. This, however made something occur at the front of each stair, roughly 20/65 metres/foot away, fountains arose, sparkling with a purple liquid, it soon overflowed and pillars formed around it, alongside various rare flowers and revival to those in the town around it. These strange occurrences soon led to the people to form guilds although one stood at the top, the 'Pleat Guild', a mansion-like building was built in front of The Portal. This guild was ran by a man named Janzo, Janzo was a married man with no kids even though he was in his 50ths at least. One day he sent our MC, Kanohoa out to send lost adventures, civilians or merchants to the city, giving them a safe passage  (INTRODUCTION)  Our MC, Kanohoa one day receives a letter from Janzo to return to the guild, after a long trip he makes it, after fighting with dozens of sand-golems and scorpion-men throughout the desert he makes it to the capital, Orehana. Once hes there he goes to visit Janzo to find that the guild was shut down and looked like it was abandoned for centuries, he turns to the temple to see that it is 'temporary closed' after swiping at least 2 inches of dust off of it.  After asking citizens around which wear very abnormal clothes, not the standard leather clothes but ones made out of cotton and cloth they say they know nothing about any guilds or about revival or the temple. He is confused especially at the houses, made out of strange orange, brownish materials they call brick, he causes a scene and attracts a ton of attention, even police notice.  He is pursued by the police who have guns, to him they are just strange magic items, he retaliates and tries to attack them with his giant, metal sword and is detained, as hes being arrested he takes a look around, no-one has any noticeable physical traits, like being made of slime, having wings and horns, being made out of fire, etc. He is confused since everyone used to be mutated, he still is so why aren't they? In court he is asked his id, not knowing what it is he asks what it is, the judge thinking he is just an idiot asks the police to search him, they find nothing.  The judge asks his age and he says 22, he also asks for simple things like what is his registration number, his street name and his surname, Kanohoa says nothing. But upon being asked his job he says he is a swordsman from the Pleat Guild, the judge asks what it is and Kanohoa is surprised he doesn't know, its the biggest, strongest and baddest guild in Orehana. Kanohoa soon finds away to slip from the chains and escape, while being chased by police the tip of his many swords cut through civilians like a chainsaw, killing people in the process, he climbs the pyramid and jumps into the center portal, it already being beat he walks to the end and escapes to one of the fountains. He goes around asking people basic questions like that is their race, do they know about the revival fountains, the dungeon portals and most importantly, about the guild, they know nothing.  In awe he panics and thinks they are lying, in retaliation he pays people to help him to explore the dungeon with real gold. They all deny and say its against the law, he asks them what year it is, they say it is the year 2198, he disagrees and say its the year 198, then he realizes 'I've been out giving directions, for 2000 YEARS!!?'.   \[Update\] I see that a lot of people are thinking I copied it from shows like Magi, although I didn't some pieces of it might come to mind while reading, I am thinking of making an actual manga for this one day. I know its a bit bland right now but I'm trying to get the main bits/idea done first then I will detail the writing. I thought of the idea of the revival system on this minecraft server I was on once in 2015 where you would die if you left the town but if you didn't you wouldn't die. My plan is that MC will soon obtain friends or meet people from his time period and explore the dungeons for answers, whilst being a threat to the country after being labelled a criminal. He will have to fight of dozens of armed officers with his companions and try set up a base in the old guild. He one day opens it but it is stormed upon after news that he owns it goes out.     He escapes to a different country which has been severely mutated, like things such as centaurs, dwarves, giants, 4 armed or legged people, etc.     And that's it so far, I will soon write it like an actual story so it isn't bland and hopefully either draw and write it myself or have an actual artist draw a manga.",anime,od93g8

"Any Anime Where the Tsundere Character Gets Confronted? While there might be some value to having a tsundere character keep up the act, I'm starting to get kinda annoyed with it. I want to watch something where the main character sees through and confronts a tsundere character and gives them an ultimatum.  Ideally what I'm looking for is a romantic comedy where the main character is the opposite of dense, and doesn't let anyone give them shit. I don't care if it's a male or female main character, I just want to see some character development forced by the main character on all of the typical tropes, where any mindgames, unintentional or otherwise, are directly confronted and all characters slowly start to become less like their trope or are rejected outright.",anime,mdp1ps

Watch the OG Dragon Ball Out of all the shows apart of the dragon ball franchise the OG Dragon Ball is the best IMO.   If you want to watch a funny shounen it’s worth a shot. The show really does hold up extremely well including its comedy even though it was originally made in 1986  Goku as a kid is pure comedy. He’s the dumbest most innocent beast of a shounen MC you’ll ever see. This show unlike Z focuses mainly on Gokus journey to get the dragon balls.,anime,h13qpg

I’m embarrassed because of the, ahem, well there is a lot of random and sometimes odd boob content (which may be a selling point for a lot of you lol).   But I thought it was a pretty badass anime with a lot of action pretty off the bat as well as a lot of fun action scenes.

"Anime where the lead female character’s whole identity ISN’T based on who she likes… I just want to watch a really good anime where the female characters have an actual personality and are likable.

I’m fine if she has a romantic interest, but I’m sick of the girls entire personality being based on a guy - she has to have goals or hobbies like a normal girl.

"Kokoro Connect **Kokoro Connect**   Writer : Sadanatsu Anda  Studio : Silver link  Runtime: 17 episodes (4 being OVAs)  Genre    : Drama, supernatural, romance and comedy bits  Air date : 8/7/2012  MAL       :   **Personal thoughts:**  When talking about highschool drama Kokoro Connect is fairly high rated and has a considerable fanbase. But in the current zeitgeist this show isn't talked about as much and does sometimes gets lost in the endless abyss of more popular shows. What sets this show apart for me is that the anime tackles a more mature aspect based around interpersonal and internal conflict within oneself. It's pretty high rated in my book for a plot that sets it apart from other shows.   **Short summary:**  A coming of age drama revolving around 5 highschool students who are friends from a highschool club (Student cultural society) which was formed as a lazy haven for themselves. The show sounds like many other highschool dramas upto this point but one random morning they find themselves randomly switching bodies with one another. Their highschool life just can't be plain anymore.  **Plot:**  The main plot here is the students finding themselves involved in supernatural phenomenons one sudden morning. A couple of the main characters find themselves in bodies (comparable to Kimi No Nawa) of one another and everyone comes together to figure out what's happening. You will find find comedy bits here and there as they try to prove to the others that they actually changed bodies. But as time passes the unnatural things happen more frequently and that's where things start changing.  **In this part I want to focus on why I believe this show is worth a watch.**  It's easy to ignore the insecurities and struggles you yourself go through simply because no one's looking. The characters all seem to be a similar bunch of generally cheeful teenagers but in reality they are going through their own worlds of trouble within themselves.  The body changing sounds fairly innocent. But when someone literally is in your body in begins seeing the world from your eyes, you can't but confront the things you always had quietly ignored. But as the group begins to see themselves in different perspectives their thoughts interwine and they are in this vague space with themselves and their insecurities. Their problems are worlds apart from one another going from family problems to romance and it goes to show how different people suffer in very different ways. As they get to know each other better they fight, they struggle but ultimately they finally get the courage to face the things that tie them down. It's a lot easier when someone is there, in a way fighting alongside you.   **Character development** is another thing I would focus on here. The protagonists start of as fairly simple high school students but it's amazing how much they end up growing as human beings after coming face to face with their struggles.   **Sub plot:**  The subplot originates from the main theme and has condiments of trust issues and romantic struggles between different characters.  **Cons:**  I personally didn't have much to complain about, but **I wouldn't say that I hype it as a masterpiece**. It's a good show that some haven't yet watched. The reason I recommend this is that it focuses on something very different and is not often seen in anime   **This focuses on a very human aspect which is often not talked about enough. It actually shows what it is to actually confront your conflicts. The things we truly go through under our happy shells and the things that really define who we are.**   **Tldr:** A highschool drama revolving around 5 teenagers focused on facing your insecurities provoked by supernatural events.

"Recommendations on mature Shoujo anime with a good plot? I want some shoujo anime with a good storyline that doesn’t have an aggravating or ditzy (annoyingly shy) female lead. Also, not set in middle school - older people (adulthood) is preferred because it’s more mature. Any suggestions of good ones would be appreciated. So far, I’ve seen Nana, Skip Beat, Maid Sama, Fruits Basket, Yona of the Dawn and Say I Love You.

But just like how you don't need to be into sports to enjoy a sports anime, you don't need to be into 90s arcade games to enjoy Hi-Score Girl. I'd describe this show as a mix of a typical sports anime with hype competitions and overly dramatic descriptions of those competitions and slice-of-life school romance.

"Anime that involves 'death games' Like every man and his dog on the planet, I've recently watched Squid Game and Alice In Borderland on Netflix and I was hoping to find anime in a similar genre. It doesn't have to invole actual death as a penalty, although preferably there would be high stakes to the games they play.   Bonus points if it involes coming up with strategies to get the 'best possible outcome' for the games and/or psychological elements.  Shows I've already seen that I think are similar: Liar Game (not an anime, but pretty much exactly what I'm after), Kaiji (this is also dead on the kind of show I love), Akagi, Kakegurui, Btooom. There are probably others, but I can't think of them off the top of my head.   Hopefully you wizards here might know of something :)",anime,q4hdd5

"Watch Gosick if you enjoy mystery’s Just finished watching Gosick the other night and I can’t stress enough how good it was. I’d say it is underrated but that’s not true as it has a score of 8.14 on MAL. I guess it’s more accurate to say it’s just not as popular or talked about. I don’t want to spoil anything but the show takes place in the early 1900’s and the heroine Victorique solves mysteries throughout the story. While the first portion of these mysteries may seem episodic they end up playing a larger role in the late game. However, this definitely is no detective show. The MC solves the cases in a Ranpo like style if your familiar with bungou of stray dogs. If mystery isn’t enough there is also a romantic subplot that is important to the development of the story. However, it never over shines the overarching plot. Besides the story being great the characters and their relationships are a 10/10 and that’s including supporting characters. If all that’s not enough to make you wanna watch it at least watch the OP as it’s low key a BOP",anime,ghs3nx

"I used to like animes, I grew up, now I don't [Request] When I was a kid/teenager I used to like animes: Dragon Ball, Cowboy Bebop, Evangelion...  Then I stopped watching them, because, you know, life.  Now, years later, as a grownup & parent, I know people my age that enjoy watching animes, so I tried again, but I don't like the recommendations I got so far: Death Note, Avatar The Last Airbender & Attack on Titan, which I believe are very popular.  My main issues are:  * Main characters are overreacting all the time, they're too intense. * I can't stand the dialogues, they are trivial and full of cliches.  Even if the plot can be interesting, I don't understand the way characters think and talk, it's not ""real"", I don't believe it, so I don't like it.  I'm not sure if this is because these animes are targeted to younger people, or because of the difference between the Japanese culture & my Western one.  Is there anyone that feels the same, and has recommendations for other animes?",anime,u8p39j

"Cute yet gory Hello!  I'm a fan of anime/manga that starts out cute/slice-of-life and becomes horror down the way.  A perfect example of this would be Madoka Magica.  I'd like recommendations of media in that genre, with cutesy graphics and/or storyline that becomes dark and brutal. I don't think that I have any filters regarding subject matter, so don't hesitate to tell me of more intense ones.  Some that I know may fit in the genre: Higurashi, Narutaru...   As a side note! I remember hearing about this one manga/anime that I can't remember the name of, but if I remember correctly it may fit in the theme... I have the picture in mind of a young boy (likely an adventurer) with cutesy style and dark subject matters that comes somewhat unexpected. I know this isn't a lot to go off from, but if anyone has any related idea, please do tell me.  Thank you everybody! Have a good night!  EDIT: The anime I was looking for was, drums roll ... ... ... Made in Abyss! LOL Thank you everybody, I'll be adding most if not all of the recommendations to MAL! :-D",anime,kwwww9

"An anime or manga like hinamatsuri What I loved about Hinamatsuri:  -The show never focuses too much on one character  -All the characters are different and don't follow main stereotypes, so every episode feels fresh  -The superpowers of the girls are mainly used for comedic relief and are not a major plot line.  -A vase-sexual non-typical main lead (Nitta) that has his own flaws but tries his best to be a fatherly figure towards Hina and Anzu  -Best daughter Anzu  Please recommend me a show or a manga that is similar to hinamatsuri, or at least, ticks most of the above points. For the record, i have watched most of MAL recommendations on the hinamatsuri anime page.  Thank you for your time.

"Two *Highly Underrated* Slice of Life / Romance Shows If you're not averse to LGBT+ relationships I highly recommend checking out:  {The Case Files of Jeweler Richard} [official trailer]( and {Jie Yao (Antidote)}  The synopsis and tags for The Case Files of Jeweler Richard are so far off from what the show is really about, they do not do it justice. Don't bother looking it up, if you want a super sweet, relaxing, and *heavily implied* bl-romance then this is the show for you! It's far less of a mystery/detective series and more a commentary on sexuality, prejudice, and relationships. I loved it.  I've seen just about every BL/yaoi show out there so I jumped at Antidote and binged half of the series last night (English subs on YouTube). So far it's adorable, exciting, and pretty emotional. The characters start flirting very early on and it progresses at a solid, believable rate. I really like how mental illness has been discussed openly and in a chill, understanding way. I'm very interested to see where it goes... I'll post an update later if my suggestion ends up being a dud.  The animation is frickin' beautiful in both shows too!  EDIT: just finished Jie Yao (Antidote) and it’s was great!! I don’t want to spoil anything so I won’t say more. Go watch! :)",anime,gm6hiu

"Anime that sexualizes men instead of women for a change. Like even in battle sequences, all they can focus on is bouncy titties and all my straight friends enjoy that. I need an anime with decent plot that has fan service for gay men or straight women.  IK that Free! is a good anime with shirtless guys but besides that, are there any anime that sexualize men?

I have already watched Fairy Tail and the sexualization of men was great and I enjoyed it alongside the good plot. I have also watched Food Wars, great too.

"Animes that heavily feature an Onsen (Japanese Hot Spring) as a setting for more than just a single episode Onsen Episodes are common fan-service episodes in many anime where the characters visit a Hot Spring, while I'm fine with fan-service, I'd really love to see an anime that focuses much more heavily on the onsen as a setting beyond a single episode. I love the look and atmosphere of these Hot Springs, especially when paired with Traditional Inns and have separate bathing areas for men and women.  So any good animes (or manga) that use an onsen for a setting beyond just using it as a fanservice episode? (Fanservice is fine, but optional)",anime,g8whv6
"Watch K-Project. It's seriously amazing! K (also known as K-Project) is seriously an amazing anime. It has beautiful and a different animation and really amazing fighting scenes with really amazing camera angles (in terms of both in fighting scenes as well as you know what I am talking about, my fellow degenerates). And one of the key features of this anime is it's really amazing and beautiful OST. I will say it has probably one of the best amazing OSTs ever in any show I have seen.  Order of watching the show :-  1. K (You will not get any result by searching just K so you can search for ""K-Project"" instead) 2. K: Missing Kings (Don't leave this movie thinking it's just a filler movie. It connects 1st season to the 2nd season) 3. K: Return of Kings (This is the 2nd and probably the final season) 4. K: Seven Stories Movie (There are 7 movies which are all prequel to the 1st season of the show except the 6th movie which is an epilogue for the show and tells what happens after 2nd season. It covers a lot of questions which remained unanswered in 1st and 2nd season of the show)  There are also a manga which were adapted from the show. It covers the entire anime just that anime is better than manga. I would suggest to read manga after watching the show as it explains more in detail about what's happening in the show.  I will not say that this is the best or one of the best shows ever made. Just that it is probably one of the shows which is really entertaining and will leave you wanting for more. This story maybe not at be all amazing or so but still everything else in the show cover up its flaws. Even you are able to notice it but still will enjoy this show a lot.   Hope after reading my post maybe you all will give it a try.  Note :- This show starts off as a lot confusing, but you will start understanding everything after the first few episodes.",anime,f6q80j

Please help a tired anime fan lol, sorry if the post sounds like I'm hating on anime, I love it. Cheers.

"Typical shonen but with a female main protagonist Now, I know some shonen with female leads, but I'm searching for a stereotypical shonen with a female lead. The likes of Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, and My Hero Academia. Hot-blooded protagonist, large cast, power of friendship, focused on fighting... you know the drill.  I've always heard that part of the appeal of that kind of shonen comes from the fact its intended male viewers can project onto the main characters. So I got curious and now I want to try that out. To clarify, I'm a female young adult. And, yeah, I know I'm not a teenage girl anymore, but I still enjoy magical girl anime and cartoons, so it's not that much of a stretch for me.  If possible, suggest at least a decent anime. I don't ask for much, just that it's not absolute crap. Thanks :3",anime,sbpnv7

"33 humble anime suggestions. [**Visual tier chart**](  I made this before realizing images aren't allowed on this sub :( Here it is anyways.  Each tier is categorized in descending order: leftmost/topmost is the best in its tier.  I've also added a *\[FAMILY FRIENDLY\]* tag i.e. anime with minimal to none sexual themes and nudity. I've also added *\[NSFW\]* tag for anime which you shouldn't watch in public as they frequently feature sexual themes/nudity/basically things you wouldn't want your family/peers to see.  ## 10: Mixed bag #1  * [**Initial D**]( a love letter to Japanese street racing culture, and every kid who had car posters in their room. Eurobeat is pure hype! Seeing your favorite car in this anime is pure hype! * [**Little Witch Academia**]( a lighthearted magical fantasy. Sit back and enjoy this one. *\[FAMILY FRIENDLY\]* * [**Hinamatsuri**]( a lesson in human values disguised in a hilarious package. *\[1st episode features nudity; otherwise FAMILY FRIENDLY\]* * [**Spice and Wolf**]( action adventure romance where the MCs aren’t retarded. Features a travelling salesman (spice), a demigod (wolf), and their well written banter.  ## 9: Mixed bag #2  * [**K-ON**]( cute girls doing cute things. *\[FAMILY FRIENDLY\]* * [**Tatami Galaxy**]( an eye-opening experience teaching the value of living in the present. *\[Slightly NSFW; I'd recommend you watch it alone as I think it is interned that way\]* * [**Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru**]( just a really well made romcom with a good mix of drama. * [**Grand Blue**]( a great comedy anime with over the top reactions, and some touching moments here and there. *\[NSFW\]*  ## 8: Mixed bag #3 - action heavy  * [**Gintama**]( a parody anime which knows when to flex its action. It also features one of the best character cast.\[NOTE\] the first 24 episodes (first half of S1) are just character introductions. If you ever feel bored of it, just start at episode 25 where the plot really kicks in. *\[NSFW\]* * [**Samurai Champloo**]( dope sword-fights, dope visuals, dope soundtrack. Dope. * [**Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken**]( the only isekai (isekai = human is transported/reborn into a new world) anime I really got into. The power crawl is absolutely fucked, but I think the characters and world-building redeems this anime. *\[Somewhat NSFW\]*  ## 7: Uplifting  * [**Gin no Saji**]( take a break from the city life and find what truly matters. If you feel you're stuck in a academic ratrace and don't know what you want to do with your life, you will find comfort in this anime. *\[FAMILY FRIENDLY\]* * [**Hitoribocchi no Marumaru Seikatsu**]( a shy girl’s journey to make friends. As someone who had difficulty making first contact, this anime is truly special to me; tears me up every time (happy tears). *\[FAMILY FRIENDLY\]* * [**Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon**]( a sugary mix of slice of life and comedy. A dragon is transported into our world, and starts living as a maid for Kobayashi-san. * [**Barakamon**]( feel you’ve lost your spark? say no more. The MC feels burnt out in his profession, moves to a village, and the people there help him reignite his spark. *\[FAMILY FRIENDLY\]*  ## 6: Romance  * [**Mysterious Girlfriend X**]( this is a weird anime. Actually, weird would be an understatement. There is this undeniable charm to this anime I cannot express in words. Just go and watch it and please give it 3 episodes. *\[NSFW\]* * [**Your Name.**]( ever felt you’re connected by the red string of fate with someone? What will you transcend to make *it* true? * [**Tsuki ga Kirei**]( a grounded anime about teenage love and distance.\[NOTE\] Watch last episode’s ED if you don’t want to depress yourself like I did. * [**Sakura Trick**]( just a wholesome yuri anime where the MCs actually show affection towards each other regularly. Kiss density per episode = 7.69 *\[Somewhat NSFW; every anime is hentai meme here\]* * Honorable Mention: [**ReLIFE**]( you’re given a chance to relive your high school life, but everyone will forget about you after you graduate. Will you take the pill?  ## 5: Comedy  * [**Daily Lives of High School Boys**]( over the top reactions, amazing characters, and hilarious situations. There is never a dull moment in this anime. It was my first anime, and it still feels fresh after my 4th re-watch. * [**The Disastrous Life of Saiki K**]( MC is a psychic with every ESP ability imaginable (some of which are always ON). Watch this closest being to God try live a normal life. It has clever writing and some seriously well done support characters.  *\[FAMILY FRIENDLY\]*\[NOTE\] I took some time to actually get into the series, so I’d recommend to stick for at least 6 episodes. * [**Asobi Asobase**]( 3 lovable girls with over the top reactions and hilarious situations. It also features one of the best voice acting I’ve seen in a while. It is seriously astounding how much this anime achieves while confining itself to an empty classroom for the most part.  ## 4: Mecha  * [**Eureka Seven**]( a love-story written by heaven’s storywriter. This anime is certainly a bit rough around the edges, but I love it regardless. * [**Neon Genesis Evangelion**]( life is worth living as long as sun, earth, and moon exist. Mecha genre is the backdrop of this story about four people (the main cast at least) struggling with their identity and existence. * [**Darling in the FRANXX**]( a really well done love story. It is heavily inspired by Eureka Seven and NGE, and I’ll take anything inspired by these. *\[NSFW\]*\[NOTE\] The series takes the worst nosedive of any anime I’ve watched so I’d recommend you watch episode 01-15. Just assume the series ended at episode 15 and live a happy and fulfilled life.  ## 3: Three top three  * [**Avatar the Last Airbender**]( a story about coming to terms with the powers and responsibility bestowed on a kid. Every single main character is impeccably written. The blend of animation, art-style, martial arts, music, score, world-building, and story make this “anime” (seriously, don’t sweat over the classification and just watch it) the closest thing to a 10/10 (along with the #2 and #1 on this list). *\[FAMILY FRIENDLY\]* * [**Mob Psycho 100**]( the MC has tremendous guilt over his actions during his unconscious God-like state. In order to suppress his powers, he locks away his emotions. Unfortunately, there is only so much he can hold, and he explodes with God-like powers once he reaches 100% of his limit. Watch Mob come to terms with his emotions and abilities, and change the lives of people around him while changing himself. *\[FAMILY FRIENDLY\]* * [**Non Non Biyori**]( slice of life is a dangerous genre - if the viewer does not like the characters, no amount of writing will save the series. Non non biyori has likable characters, good stories, and the feel good element which every SoL anime aspires to give. What makes this my favorite SoL is the fact that it goes above and beyond with its visuals and sound. A lot of care went into making this anime this homely. *\[FAMILY FRIENDLY\]*  ## 2: Feels  * [**Houseki no Kuni**](  I can go on about how good the visuals, characters, soundtrack, and cinematography is, but it is one of those things you have to experience to understand as anything I say will either not make sense or spoil the series. A truly amazing hidden gem \*wink wink\* * [**Kimetsu no Yaiba**]( this is the only action focused anime I've really enjoyed, like ever. The plot is great, the characters are likable, the art-style is unique, and the animation is simply beautiful. Episode 19 is already one of my fav of all time. It is still an active series and I have really high expectations from this anime. Did I mention the animation is beautiful?\[NOTE\] This is definitely a slow starter with consistent 8/10 on the first cour of S1 and then touching 11/10 on the second cour. And holy shit the sword arts are orgasmic. * [**Studio Ghibli Movies**]( I know, I know. I'm cheating. For the people who're new to anime, Studio Ghibli is like the Disney of Japan, but they actually make their own stories.  ## 1: Numero Uno  * [**Monogatari Series**]( SHAFT studio flexes their artistic vision on the works of NisiOisiN. Its a very hit or miss anime, so watch the first two episodes of Bakemonogatari before you worry about the watch order. Art is top notch, soundtrack top notch, stories are top notch, characters are top notch, waifus are top notch, foreshadowing is top notch, you get the drift. The best praise I can give this series is that it is clever and it knows it is clever. *\[NSFW\]*\[NOTE\] You might want to watch some 15-20 anime of various genre before watching this one.",anime,cppgxu

"Harem Anime where the MC isn't dense but isn't a perv I'm tired of seeing every harem anime fall into one of two categories:  1. The MC is super dense and doesn't pick up on any of the heroines' hints or signals. Even when the heroines are super forward, the MC still backs away, and he's always super flustered and embarrassed when caught. 2. The MC is just a perv. While he might be a good person overall, all of his comments and actions just come across as off-putting and gross to the heroines.  I want to watch a harem show where while the girls are all the same, the MC either just vibing and comfortable with whatever's going on, or is actually proactive about what he wants. I'm thinking maybe a protagonist similar to Sakuta from Bunny Girl Senpai.  Are there any shows out there like that? I'd love to see something new in the genre.",anime,k8xiad

"Slice of life anime with a nice male mc? So, what I want is kind of specific you could say. I want an anime which is slice of life, preferably in a school setting *(but I wouldn't mind if it isn't),* and as I said a nice male mc. This could go from cute and wholesome to nice but introverted *(sorry, idk how to describe it, he just needs to be a nice person, can be edgy but as long as he's nice)*.  I don't mind if there's drama, sometimes I love drama, and I certainly wouldn't mind if it's comedy. I don't like romance quite so much, but it's tolerable if there's **no harem or ecchi.** Also, **if you find a manga that fits this description quite well, please feel free to mention.**  Sorry that this is so specific, I'm really picky with anime so I do apologise! I've also watched quite a few like this but I can't find any good ones lately. Thanks!

"My only regret watching Violet Evergarden... ...is having watched it already because I can never watch it for the first time ever again. :’(  Although I can confirm that episode 10 hits EVEN HARDER the second time so at least there’s that.  While I’m thinking of it I figured I’d also explain the difference in dub vs sub. I prefer the sub because it captures the persona of the main character better and makes the emotional parts much more intense due to the fact that the sub portrays the MC with less emotion in normal speech. On the other hand, the English dub is wonderfully adapted but gives the MC more inflection and noticeably more emotion in all conversations which is certainly great to hear, especially from the MC, but again works a bit against the plot of the anime. So in my opinion, if you wanna get riggity rekt - watch sub. If you want the MC to be slightly more relatable or you’re someone who’s completely turned off by other languages - watch dub.   Edit: more feels  Edit #2: added Sub vs. Dub recommendation",anime,d8gsgf

im trying to find an anime but only remember one scene So a while back I found an anime that I really wanted to watch but I couldn't find a title or anything else apart for a short part of the anime. this is the scene.  A young girl is in a big white room with other people. they are taking turns shooting at targets. when it comes to the girls turn she asks if she should run after taking the shot. the other people in the group laugh  at her and question why she would run since she is sniping the target. The instructor told her it wasn't needed since it wasn't a real life situation. when she shot she hit the target but the shot was so strong it left a huge whole in the wall. the other people in the group where shocked.  I don't remember any of the hair colors or names and that's why I've been having a difficult time trying to find it.  if anyone might know what it's called please give a title of what it might be.,anime,ots0eu

"Any anime I can watch with my mom? She likes action, morally complex characters, mystery, serious subjects and drama/intensity. She doesn't like too much fanservice but is fine with gore. Hates perverted humour and immature characters. She also values stories with good best friend dynamics more than romance. Slice of Life/Comedy is fine as long as it's interesting and/or non episodic. We have seen:  * Jujutsu Kaisen: She absolutely loved it, the action was intense and she loved a lot of the characters, especially Nanami. * Death Note: She liked Light and L's rivalry, wasn't a big fan of second half, but loved the intensity and the mind games overall. * Steins;Gate: It was difficult for her to get interested in it but she was impressed by how it progressed. * Demon Slayer: Didn't really like it, wasn't a fan of the amount of screaming. She did like Mugen train arc though. * I want to eat your pancreas: She didn't like it, mostly just felt bored throughout the entire movie and felt like the sad scenes weren't that sad. * Run with the wind: She loved the anime so much she started reading the novel because she wanted to stay with the characters longer. * Banana Fish: Loved it, mainly because of the drama and how Ash and Eiji's relationship developed. She also likes the gunfight theme. * Given: She usually doesn't watch much romance centric stories but she adores this anime because of how it dealt with the subjects and relationships. * Toradora: Hated it, felt like it was too unrealistic and dumb.

"Romance anime's with actual couple things? Kissing, intimacy, dates, sex ,etc Hello everyone,  Lately I have been going through some kind of period in my life and I have been watching almost exclusively romance anime. There were a couple off good ones but in most romance anime (at least for me) the couple which we get on screen barely have any kind of intimacy at all. Therefore, the name of the thread.  What I would like from you kind people is your suggestions on anime that have quite a few scenes where we can see the love between the couple in anime. Where we can say for example ""Wow id like my relationship to be exactly like this"". I don't know if I expressed myself correctly but all of you suggestions are welcome.  Below, I will list all the romance anime I have watched so far:  The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated  Horimiya  Golden time  Your lie in April (cried like a little bitch at the end here and to scared to watch it again lol xD)  Maid-sama  Kaguya-sama love is war  Bunny girl senpai  Daaaaaaaarliiiiiing  My dress up darling  Nisekoi  SAO  Charlotte  Toradora  Silent voice  There are some more but those are all from top of my head. I hope you get what i mean with my explanation but if you don't, feel free to make suggestions and I will reply as best as I can. Thank you!  Edit 1: Thank you all for your wonderful suggestions! If anyone has anything else to add, feel free to do so and i will answer back as soon as i can.

Yeah. That.  I’m talking about the kind of season 2 that feels like it was written during a fever dream and animated with leftover budget from a toothpaste commercial. Plot? Gone. Character development? Reverse engineered into nonsense. Pacing? Imagine sprinting face-first into a brick wall, then crawling backward through molasses.  For me, Tokyo Ghoul is the biggest betrayal.

"Suggest your MUST WATCH anime with a proper ending! I am making this post for anyone and everyone who is sick and tired of watching 12 episodes of world building, foreshadowing, and relationship teasing, just for nothing to happen in the end. Instead of getting a *proper ending*, you are now teased on future events to hype you up for another season... except there is no other season because it didn’t do well enough hahahahaha  Anyways, *proper ending* here mean that the story must tie up all loose ends. So it can be a status quo type ending of “the story will always continue!”, or even a “my story has just begun!” type of ending. It does not have to be a “this story ends as this chapter of my life ends” type of ending, though obviously it can be. As long as every villain that was mentioned during the anime is dealt with, every character arc that was shown during the anime is complete, and every problem that was shown during the anime is resolved— with no more foreshadowing, no more teasing, and no more issues— that’s what I mean by proper ending.  **Any genre, any style, from any time.**  *(also does not need to faithfully follow the source material)*  Mine would be:  {Hanasaku Iroha} best ever coming of age story  {A Place Further than the Universe} very uplifting and emotional  {Welcome to the NHK} will be depressing for the depressed  {Dragon Ball} not Z. I love kid Goku  {Blue Exorcist} Season 1 is great for casual anime fans  {Little Witch Academia} very fun. Watch the movies then the anime series.  {Shirobako} technically not over since a movie is coming out. Still watch it  {Kill La Kill} be prepared for some craziness  {K-on} fluffy fluffy time  {Naruto} because I just remembered that it’s an anime and that it actually ended but for some reason has a sequel series named Boruto  That’s all I can honestly think of right now.

If you haven't watched Saiki K, watch it now and thank me later. It's mainly comedy, has 2 seasons, each with 24 episodes. All of them are so much fun. And since the pacing of the anime is insanely fast (seriously, they even speak inhumanely fast sometimes) there is NEVER a boring moment in the anime (at least to me)  For me,  Premise: excellent!

"Why you should watch Fruits Basket. ""It's not always easy to see the good in people. But if you can somehow, find a way to believe, sometimes that's all it takes to help someone."" - Kyoko Honda.  This pretty much sums up what Fruits Basket is all about.   **The Title: -** Fruits Basket is a series that is bound to touch your heart. Barging in with a girl named Tohru Honda, this show was designed to keep you shedding tears of joy and grief. It was a long series with a total of 63 episodes and it was a great journey. The first season begins as a comedy, but when you are into the show, after a few episodes, you will feel the darkness of Fruits Basket. 'Fruits Basket' is a game that is played by little kids at school in Japan (according to the show, at least). It's seems unreasonable why Natsuki Takaya came up with such a name for this anime. But, trust me, the name defines the anime. It defines how you can find someone whom you will love you no matter what happens, and that even if you are lonely,  there will be people waiting you.  **The Characters and the Plot: -** Now, coming to the characters, we have Tohru Honda, the female protagonist and the two male deuterogonists, Yuki Sohma and Kyo Sohma. Nope, it's not a reverse harem. As I said, this anime shows how someone can be the right person to several people who are helpless and desperate. Anyways, the show starts with the Sohma family who are cursed , that is, the get converted into zodiac animals, when embraced by someone of the opposite sex. Yeah it's funny, but believe me, it's so freaking dark, as the Sohmas consider themselves to be monsters. The story revolves around a ton of characters , both the Sohmas and normal humans, and how Tohru Honda gives each person the reason to live.   Also, it has one of the best written antagonists I've seen so far, and that's Akito Sohma, the head of the Sohma clan. You keep on hating him unless, you find yourself in dark, because everything about him is dark. But remember, there is the beacon of light too and that's Tohru Honda... Plus, Fruits Basket's two male deuterogonists are one of the best duos I've seen so far. They hate each other, but that's not all. Its something entirely different. You have to watch Fruits Basket for that. There are so many memorable characters, that I don't know with whom I should start, but for me, the most touching relationship was that of Tohru and her mom, Kyoko. It's a series full of surprises because you will come across a plot twist out of nowhere.  **Why you should watch Fruits Basket: -** I have seen many anime, some that showed me what friendship is, some which showed me what parenting is, some that showed me what romance is, some which showed me what family means, but Fruits Basket showed me everything. It has everything in it and that's love. It shows how a simple girl can be like a friend, a sister, a lover and above all a mother figure, someone you can hold on to, someone who will never let you go, someone for whom you want to keep on living, just to see her smile. Believe me or not  it's an emotional rollercoaster. Sometimes you will be laughing like hell, while sometimes you will be crying like hell. That's the kind of show it is. It is a masterpiece. If you have not tried it yet, please watch it. You won't regret it.   ""Even if she gets lost, even if she makes mistakes, in the end, let her have a life she can be proud of. The kind of life that’ll make people say, “You did your best.” Joyous times, sad times…the cycle repeating itself, again and again. That’s how I want her to grow older.""-Kyoko Honda.",anime,qwbhvo
"Anime With a Well-Written Antagonist Just looking for an anime with an antagonist that isn’t there as just an obstacle or for the plot’s sake.

ID:INVADED is a great anime that doesnt get a lot of love. ID:INVADED if you like detective anime.It has great animation and great soundtrack while making you sad closely every episode.Its protagonist has the saddest but most well done backstory ever made and is the most interesting character i have seen in a long time despite him acting emotionless for a few episodes.The mysteries are very well done and the killers are pretty sick.One of them becomes the side protagonist due to his killings mostly being accidents from him wanting to help people in a twisted way.,anime,hcjosm
Darker Than Black So I recently finished this awesome anime as mentioned in title. This anime is very old and was released back in 2007 and I'm quite surprised that I haven't even watched it back then. So it follows a story of a Chinese person who has ability to produce electricity. He is portrayed as a villain but is actually good guy. He is shown as badass guy who doesn't care about anyone and follows his orders. I would highly recommend watching it,anime,filb2n

"Anime for A Conservative Family Hi! I'm looking for animes to recommend to a friend. Her family is HIGHLY strict and conservative. She is not allowed to do her own research so she asked me to help her out. Her parents screen anything she watches and she isn't allowed her own devices so it'd be hard to get past. The rules her parents set are: - No magic or magical powers (unicorns and dragons are ok though)  - No witchcraft -No cursing or implied cursing -No vulgar language against God or Christianity -No Sexual material -No innuendos -No gore or high violence (if a character trips and bleeds a little that's ok) -No suicidal content -No alcohol references I have already suggested Drifting Home, Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop, Haikyu (which is a risky one), and a lot of Studio Ghibli (also risky)  I don't know what her parents will agree to, but I'm just trying to help her out, any suggestions would be awesome! Thank you!  Edit; So I did not expect this to blow up, I just wanted recommendations on anime... I appreciate the concern for my friend, since a lot happened I shall update First of all this was already in the works before but she is now at our highschool, she is still getting used to it but I'm guiding her around.

"No or very little Fanservice, no overt/intense sexuality, no violence, no evil characters & mostly female mains please! Just looking for something a bit more mellow than I'm used to.

I just started watching Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo and I'm quite liking that the sexuality/nudity elements are subdued and feel innocent.

"Suggestions for an anime episode to play for my class One of my classes is extremely quiet and it's so awkward to teach when no one wants to talk/discuss/share anything at all. From student feedback, it's because no one really knows each other and most of the students are shy. Which then makes it so that *no one* wants to share even if they're not that shy (relatively).   So I'm hoping to turn to y'all for any anime suggestions that I can play for the class. Preferably only one episode. I'm well-known as a weeby teacher so this isn't too out-of-character, and about half of the students said they'd enjoy the experience. (I'm also going to do some activities and icebreakers, so it's not *just* anime. Lol.)  Some things I'm looking for from this anime episode:  * Should be appropriate. *Extremely* appropriate. No fanservice (at all), blood, death, etc. * Hopefully something that would hook anyone, and keep a relative newbie's attention. * If possible, result in some student discussion after the episode. Like, what they saw, how they interpreted what they saw, what it means, etc. Something to break the ice. So like, I suppose I'm looking for something that's thought-provoking, interesting, mysterious... etc. Idk, something where I could have follow-up questions for them to talk/share/discuss/debate. * Maybe even a cliffhanger of sorts? (Very low priority.)  It's an environmental studies class, so that's some context. But it probably doesn't have to be too science-oriented (if at all) if it'd fail to keep as much attention as another suggestion. Thank you so much in advance!  Edit: It's lunch right now. Sorry I took so long to follow up, and I didn't expect so many responses! I'm also sorry I won't be able to respond to everyone. Thank you so much for everyone's responses. I saw a lot of really good ones that I'm super interested in sharing one episode of, like ""Kino's Journey"", ""A Place Further Than The Universe"", ""Haikyuu"", and ""Mushishi""! I saw so many others like ""FMA"", ""Cells at Work"", ""Death Note"", and ""Made in Abyss"", but... I'll use these ones as ""highly recommended"" should the students want to continue learning more about anime! Super grateful for everyone's input and I'll see how to create a discussion or prompt out of the top ones I mentioned! :) Thank you everyone.  Edit 2: I'm finished with school today. The period in question meets tomorrow, so hopefully this all goes well! You're all amazing and I'm so thankful again!

"Your “hidden gems” of anime. The anime you would consider a “Hidden gem,” or underrated.  An anime you found very pleasing to watch that you were suprised you hadn’t found sooner.   Could just be an anime you decided to click one day, but then started thinking “why have I never seen this.”   When this happens to me, I always end up enjoying the anime, so please recommend thanks.          Or just send me your favorite. :)",anime,17dt0gv

suggest animes better than Attack on Titan. Hey guys! I know what you're thinking. Every anime has its own flavour. But if you've seen aot you'd know why it would stand out from the rest. Can you suggest me animes that you think is better than aot given you've seen both the suggestion anime and aot.  TIA.,anime,vzwys2
"dark anime?? i wanna watch something that seems like a cute fun show at first, then does a complete 180 and becomes dark as fuck. basically the promised neverland. something with a life or death situation.",anime,stt083
"Do your absolute worst I'm in the mood for some terrible, barely watchable anime right now. Recommend me what you think is the single worst anime you've ever finished watching. Doesn't matter why it's bad. Whether it's awful visuals, frustrating characters and dialogue or whatever else you hate it for, just throw it at me.  I'll try to watch the ones that seem to be the most insufferable and tell you how long it took me until the anime broke me. Also, avoid the ones [I've already watched]( (which shouldn't be hard since I haven't seen too many that were irredeemably bad)  E: Thanks everyone, I have way too much to watch now. Because I couldn't decide what to start with, I threw all suggestions that looked bad enough into a randomizer and it gave me these as the first 3:  1. Cross Ange 2. Devil May Cry 3. Skelter+Heaven",anime,rv7un5

"Anime that doesn't have big boobs women or at least not a lot of it I've recently gotten into anime, one of my big reasons for avoiding it has been the way female characters are drawn. So far I've been sticking to only sport anime with few women the exception being sailor moon but I would like to watch more outside of sports so recommendations please.",anime,19daign
